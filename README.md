# The impact of journal data-sharing policies on data availability statements

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This repository contains the data and code to support an examination of
the data/code availability statements associated with preprints on
medRxiv (for an example of such a statement, see
[here](https://www.medrxiv.org/node/69681.external-links.html)), and an
analysis of whether these statements are affected by journal editorial
policies.
