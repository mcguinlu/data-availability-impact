  abstract = {The movement towards open science is a consequence of seemingly pervasive failures to replicate previous research. This transition comes with great benefits but also significant challenges that are likely to affect those who carry out the research, usually early career researchers (ECRs). Here, we describe key benefits, including reputational gains, increased chances of publication, and a broader increase in the reliability of research. The increased chances of publication are supported by exploratory analyses indicating null findings are substantially more likely to be published via open registered reports in comparison to more conventional methods. These benefits are balanced by challenges that we have encountered and that involve increased costs in terms of flexibility, time, and issues with the current incentive structure, all of which seem to affect ECRs acutely. Although there are major obstacles to the early adoption of open science, overall open science practices should benefit both the ECR and improve the quality of research. We review 3 benefits and 3 challenges and provide suggestions from the perspective of ECRs for moving towards open science practices, which we believe scientists and institutions at all levels would do well to consider.},

All but two individuals with chronic infection were gametocytaemic at enrollment, whereas only 35\% (17/48) in the incident cohort developed gametocytes within 35 days. The relative abundance of ap2-g transcripts was positively associated with conversion to gametocyte production (i.e. the ratio of gametocytes at day 14 to ring stage parasites at baseline) and was higher in chronic infections. Parasite multiplication rate, assessed by daily molecular parasite quantification, was positively associated with prospective gametocyte production. Most incident infections were cleared before gametocyte density was sufficiently high to infect mosquitoes. In contrast, chronic, asymptomatic infections represented a significant source of mosquito infections. If present, gametocytes were significantly less infectious if concurrent with malaria symptoms. Our observations support the notion that malaria transmission reduction may be expediated by enhanced case management, involving both symptom-screening and infection detection.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Methods               In this prospective, multicenter, longitudinal observational study of patients with ALS (n = 229), primary lateral sclerosis (n = 20), and progressive muscular atrophy (n = 11), biological specimens were collected, processed, and stored according to strict standard operating procedures (SOPs). Neurofilament assays were performed in a blinded manner by independent contract research organizations.                                         Results               For serum NfL and pNfH measured using the Simoa assay, there were no missing data (i.e., technical replicates below the lower limit of detection were not encountered). For the Iron Horse and Euroimmun pNfH assays, such missingness was encountered in {$\sim$}4\% and {$\sim$}10\% of serum samples, respectively. Mean coefficients of variation for NfL in serum and CSF were both {$\sim$}3\%. Mean coefficients of variation for pNfH in serum and CSF were {$\sim$}4\%\textendash 5\% and {$\sim$}2\%\textendash 3\%, respectively, in all assays. Baseline serum NfL concentration, but not pNfH, predicted the future Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) slope and survival. Incorporation of baseline serum NfL into mixed effects models of ALSFRS-R slopes yields an estimated sample size saving of {$\sim$}8\%. Depending on the method used to estimate effect size, use of serum NfL (and perhaps pNfH) as pharmacodynamic biomarkers, instead of the ALSFRS-R slope, yields significantly larger sample size savings.                                         Conclusions               Serum NfL may be considered a clinically validated prognostic biomarker for ALS.

  abstract = {Abstract           Preprint usage is growing rapidly in the life sciences; however, questions remain on the relative quality of preprints when compared to published articles. An objective dimension of quality that is readily measurable is completeness of reporting, as transparency can improve the reader's ability to independently interpret data and reproduce findings. In this observational study, we initially compared independent samples of articles published in bioRxiv and in PubMed-indexed journals in 2016 using a quality of reporting questionnaire. After that, preprints were also compared to their own journal-published versions. Peer-reviewed articles had, on average, higher quality of reporting than preprints, although the difference was small, with absolute differences of 5.0 \% [95\% CI 1.4, 8.6] and 4.7 \% [95\% CI 2.4, 7.0] of reported items in the independent samples and paired sample comparison, respectively. There were larger differences favoring peer-reviewed articles in subjective ratings of how clearly titles and abstracts presented the main findings and how easy it was to locate relevant reporting information. Changes in reporting from preprints to peer-reviewed versions did not correlate with the impact factor of the publication venue or with the time lag from bioRxiv to journal publication. Overall, our results suggest that editorial peer review has a statistically significant but small impact on improving quality of reporting. They also show that quality of reporting in preprints in the life sciences is within a similar range as that of peer-reviewed articles, albeit slightly lower on average, supporting the idea that preprints should be considered valid scientific contributions.},

Methods: In this retrospective single center study, we finally included 245 consecutive patients who confirmed COVID 19 in Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital from January 1 to February 29. Cases were classified as either discharged or dead. Demographic, clinical and laboratory datas were registered, two different nutritional indices were calculated: (i)the Controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score; (ii) prognostic nutritional index (PNI). We used univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to explore the relationship between nutritional indices and hospital death . Results: 212 of them were discharged and 33 of them died. In hospital mortality was signifcantly higher in the severe group of PNI than in the moderate and normal groups. It was also significantly worse in the severe CONUT group than in the moderate, mild , and normal CONUT groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the CONUT score (odds ratio3.371,95\%CI (1.124 10.106), p = 0.030) and PNI(odds ratio 0.721,95\% CI（0.581 0.896）,P=0.003) were independent predictors of all cause death at an early stage; Multivariate logistic regression analysis also showed that the severe group of PNI was the independent risk predictor of in hospital death(odds ratio 24.225, 95\% CI（2.147 273.327）, p=0.010).The CONUT score cutoff value was 5.5 (56.00 and 80.81\%; AUC 0.753; 95\% CI（0.644 0.862）;respectively).The PNI cutoff value was 40.58  (81.80 and 66.20\%; AUC 0.778; 95\% CI（0.686 0.809）; respectively).We use PNI and the COUNT score to assess malnutrition, which can have a prognosis effect of COVID 19 patients. Conclusion:The CONUT score and PNI could be a reliable prognostic marker of all cause death in patients with COVID 19. Keywords: Coronavirus disease 2019; nutrition; indicies; prognosis},

  abstract = {Efforts to make research results open and reproducible are increasingly reflected by journal policies encouraging or mandating authors to provide data availability statements. As a consequence of this, there has been a strong uptake of data availability statements in recent literature. Nevertheless, it is still unclear what proportion of these statements actually contain well-formed links to data, for example via a URL or permanent identifier, and if there is an added value in providing such links. We consider 531, 889 journal articles published by PLOS and BMC, develop an automatic system for labelling their data availability statements according to four categories based on their content and the type of data availability they display, and finally analyze the citation advantage of different statement categories via regression. We find that, following mandated publisher policies, data availability statements become very common. In 2018 93.7\% of 21,793 PLOS articles and 88.2\% of 31,956 BMC articles had data availability statements. Data availability statements containing a link to data in a repository\textemdash rather than being available on request or included as supporting information files\textemdash are a fraction of the total. In 2017 and 2018, 20.8\% of PLOS publications and 12.2\% of BMC publications provided DAS containing a link to data in a repository. We also find an association between articles that include statements that link to data in a repository and up to 25.36\% ({$\pm$} 1.07\%) higher citation impact on average, using a citation prediction model.

However, the validity of methodology utilized in these studies, involving doubly-labeled water, has been questioned. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether dietary energy requirement for weight-loss maintenance is higher on a low- versus high-carbohydrate diet. Methods: The study reports secondary outcomes and exploratory analyses from a feeding study in which the primary outcome was total energy expenditure. After attaining a mean Run-in weight loss of 10.5\%, 164 adults with pre-weight-loss BMI of {$\geq$}25 were randomly assigned to Test diets containing Low (20\%), Moderate (40\%) or High (60\%) carbohydrate for 20 weeks. Calorie content of Test diets was adjusted to maintain individual body weight within 2 kg of the post-weight-loss value. In analyses by Intention-to-Treat (ITT, study completers, n=148) and Per Protocol (PP, those achieving the weight-loss maintenance target, n=110), we compared estimated energy requirement from 10 to 20 weeks on the Test diets using ANCOVA. Insulin secretion was assessed pre-weight-loss as insulin concentration 30 minutes following 75 grams oral glucose (Insulin-30). Results: Estimated energy requirement was higher in the Low vs High group by models involving ITT (ranging from 181 [CI 8-353] to 223 [40-406] kcal/d; P{$\leq$};0.04) and PP (ranging from 245 [43-446] to 295 [91-499] kcal/d; P{$\leq$};0.02). This difference remained significant in sensitivity analyses accounting for change in adiposity and possible non-adherence. In observational analyses, pre-weight loss Insulin-30 predicted adverse change in body composition following weight loss. Conclusions: Energy requirement was higher on a low- versus high-carbohydrate diet during weight-loss maintenance, commensurate with total energy expenditure. These data are consistent with the carbohydrate-insulin model and lend qualified support for the validity of the doubly-labeled water method with diets varying in macronutrient composition.},

With more than 1500 currently available clinical trials for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) patients, it is important to understand patient perceptions of clinical trial participation to improve recruitment and retention. This study aimed to examine the specific challenges and barriers that might be reducing IBD patient enrollment and potential methods to overcome these barriers. Methods: Five in-person patient focus groups were conducted from February through May 2016 using two facilitation guides. Participants self-reported a diagnosis of Crohns disease or ulcerative colitis. Results: The five focus groups included a total of 34 participants. Participants discussed several barriers, including fears, disease severity at trial onset, potential adverse effects, time constraints, and the influence of both their primary IBD provider and support network. Methods to improve participation included better communication to prospective patients, reduced length of trial and time commitment, lower placebo rates, the option of open label extension, and support of the patient primary IBD provider. Conclusions: This is the first study to examine patient perceptions for IBD clinical trial enrollment, including barriers to participation and methods to improve participation. Fear and misunderstanding of clinical trials, engagement with providers, limiting time demands, and limiting the impact on work and family were found to be barriers to participation. Creative solutions to these problems could lead to greater participation in trials and more rapid advancement of new therapies to clinical approval and use.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}h2{$>$}Summary{$<$}/h2{$><$}p{$>$}Much biomedical research is observational. The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study's generalisability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We defined the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs: cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September, 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of STROBE contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the STROBE statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles. 18 items are common to all three study designs and four are specific for cohort, case-control, or cross-sectional studies. A detailed explanation and elaboration document is published separately and is freely available on the websites of \emph{PLoS Medicine, Annals of Internal Medicine}, and \emph{Epidemiology}. We hope that the STROBE statement will contribute to improving the quality of reporting of observational studies.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Such policies help increase the reproducibility of the published literature, as well as make a larger body of data available for reuse and re-analysis. In this study, we evaluate the extent to which authors have complied with this policy by analyzing Data Availability Statements from 47,593 papers published in PLOS ONE between March 2014 (when the policy went into effect) and May 2016. Our analysis shows that compliance with the policy has increased, with a significant decline over time in papers that did not include a Data Availability Statement. However, only about 20\% of statements indicate that data are deposited in a repository, which the PLOS policy states is the preferred method. More commonly, authors state that their data are in the paper itself or in the supplemental information, though it is unclear whether these data meet the level of sharing required in the PLOS policy. These findings suggest that additional review of Data Availability Statements or more stringent policies may be needed to increase data sharing.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The world continues to face an ongoing viral pandemic that presents a serious threat to human health. The virus underlying the COVID-19 disease, SARS-CoV-2, has caused over 3.2 million confirmed cases and 220,000 deaths between January and April 2020. Although the last pandemic of respiratory disease of viral origin swept the globe only a decade ago, the way science operates and responds to current events has experienced a paradigm shift in the interim. The scientific community has responded rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic, releasing over 16,000 COVID-19 related scientific articles within 4 months of the first confirmed case, of which at least 6,000 were hosted by preprint servers. We focused our analysis on bioRxiv and medRxiv, two growing preprint servers for biomedical research, investigating the attributes of COVID-19 preprints, their access and usage rates, characteristics of their sharing on online platforms, and the relationship between preprints and their published articles. Our data provides evidence for increased scientific and public engagement (COVID-19 preprints are accessed and distributed at least 15 times more than non-COVID-19 preprints) and changes in journalistic practice with reference to preprints. We also find evidence for changes in preprinting and publishing behaviour: COVID-19 preprints are shorter, with fewer panels and tables, and reviewed faster. Our results highlight the unprecedented role of preprints and preprint servers in the dissemination of COVID-19 science, and the likely long-term impact of the pandemic on the scientific publishing landscape.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Access to data is a critical feature of an efficient, progressive, and ultimately self-correcting scientific ecosystem. But the extent to which in-principle benefits of data sharing are realized in practice is unclear. Crucially, it is largely unknown whether published findings can be reproduced by repeating reported analyses upon shared data (``analytic reproducibility''). To investigate, we conducted an observational evaluation of a mandatory open data policy introduced at the journal Cognition. Interrupted time-series analyses indicated a substantial post-policy increase in data available statements (104/417, 25\% pre-policy to 136/174, 78\% post-policy), although not all data appeared reusable (23/104, 22\% pre-policy to 85/136, 62\%, post-policy). For 35 of the articles determined to have reusable data, we attempted to reproduce 1324 target values. Ultimately, 64 values could not be reproduced within a 10\% margin of error. For 22 articles all target values were reproduced, but 11 of these required author assistance. For 13 articles at least one value could not be reproduced despite author assistance. Importantly there were no clear indications that original conclusions were seriously impacted. Mandatory open data policies can increase the frequency and quality of data sharing. However, suboptimal data curation, unclear analysis specification, and reporting errors can impede analytic reproducibility, undermining the utility of data sharing and the credibility of scientific findings.},

Ultimately, target values were reproducible without author involvement for 9 (36\% [20,59]) articles; reproducible with author involvement for 6 (24\% [8,47]) articles; not fully reproducible with no substantive author response for 3 (12\% [0,35]) articles; and not fully reproducible despite author involvement for 7 (28\% [12,51]) articles. Overall, 37 major numerical discrepancies remained out of 789 checked values (5\% [3,6]), but original conclusions did not appear affected. Non-reproducibility was primarily caused by unclear reporting of analytic procedures. These results highlight that open data alone is not sufficient to ensure analytic reproducibility.}

Reform initiatives have emphasized the benefits of several transparency and reproducibility-related research practices; however, their adoption across the psychology literature is unknown. To estimate their prevalence, we manually examined a random sample of 250 psychology articles published between 2014-2017. Over half of the articles were publicly available (154/237, 65\% [95\% confidence interval, 59\%-71\%]); however, sharing of research materials (26/183, 14\% [10\%-19\%]), study protocols (0/188, 0\% [0\%-1\%]), raw data (4/188, 2\% [1\%-4\%]), and analysis scripts (1/188, 1\% [0\%-1\%]) was rare. Pre-registration was also uncommon (5/188, 3\% [1\%-5\%]). Many articles included a funding disclosure statement (142/228, 62\% [56\%-69\%]), but conflict of interest statements were less common (88/228, 39\% [32\%-45\%]). Replication studies were rare (10/188, 5\% [3\%-8\%]) and few studies were included in systematic reviews (21/183, 11\% [8\%-16\%]) or meta-analyses (12/183, 7\% [4\%-10\%]). Overall, the results suggest that transparency and reproducibility-related research practices were far from routine. These findings establish a baseline which can be used to assess future progress towards increasing the credibility and utility of psychology research.},

Results: There were 220 CCUs registered for training, providing 2166 CCU beds and 1473 ventilators. Regional distribution of CCU beds per 100,000 population ranged from 1.0 in Sindh to none in Gilgit Baltistan (median 0.7). A senior clinician trained in critical care was available in 19 (12.1\%) of units, giving a ratio of one trained intensivist for every 82 CCU beds and 0.009 trained intensivists per 100,000 population. One to one nurse to bed ratio during the day was available in 84 (53.5\%) of units, dropping to 75 (47.8\%) at night. Availability of 1:1 nursing also varied between provinces, ranging from 56.5\% in Punjab compared to 0\% in Azad Jamu Kashmir. All CCUs had basic infrastructure (electricity, running water, piped oxygen) and basic equipment (electronic monitoring and infusion pumps). Conclusion: Pakistan, a lower middle-income country has an established network of critical care facilities with access to basic equipment, but inequalities in its distribution. Investment in critical care training for doctors and nurses is needed.},

In clinical research patient privacy and consent for use of personal health information are key considerations, but agreed-upon definitions of what constitutes anonymised patient information do not appear to have been established.

We examined associations between total meat, red meat, processed meat and poultry intake and incidence for 20 common cancer sites. Methods and Findings: We analysed data from 475,023 participants (54\% women) in UK Biobank. Participants were aged 37 73 years and cancer free at baseline. Information on meat consumption was based on a touchscreen questionnaire completed at baseline covering type and frequency of meat intake. Diet intake was re-measured a minimum of three times in a subsample (15\%) using a web-based 24h dietary recall questionnaire. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the association between baseline meat intake and cancer incidence. Trends in risk across baseline meat intake categories were calculated by assigning a mean value to each category using estimates from the re-measured meat intakes. During a mean follow-up of 6.9 years, 28,955 participants were diagnosed with a malignant cancer. Total, red and processed meat intakes were each positively associated with risk of colorectal cancer (e.g. hazard ratio (HR) per 70 g/day higher intake of red and processed meat combined 1.31, 95\%-confidence interval (CI) 1.14-1.52). Red meat intake was positively associated with breast cancer (HR per 50 g/day higher intake 1.12, 1.01-1.24) and prostate cancer (1.15, 1.03-1.29). Poultry intake was positively associated with risk for cancers of the lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues (HR per 30g/day higher intake 1.16, 1.03-1.32). Only the associations with colorectal cancer were robust to Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Study limitations include unrepresentativeness of the study sample for the UK population, low case numbers for less common cancers and the possibility of residual confounding. Conclusions: Higher intakes of red and processed meat were associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer. The observed positive associations of red meat consumption with breast and prostate cancer, and poultry intake with cancers of the lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues, require further investigation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Patients with the 'aggressive' form of MS accrue disability at an accelerated rate, typically reaching EDSS {$>$}= 6 within 10 years of symptom onset. Several clinicodemographic factors have been associated with aggressive MS, but less research has focused on clinical markers that are present in the first year of disease. The development of early predictive models of aggressive MS is essential to optimise treatment in this MS subtype. We evaluated whether patients who will develop severe MS can be identified based on early clinical markers, and to replicate this analysis in an independent cohort. Patient data were obtained from MSBase. Inclusion criteria were (a) first recorded disability score (EDSS) within 12 months of symptom onset, (b) at least 2 recorded EDSS scores, and (c) at least 10 years of observation time. Patients were classified as having 'aggressive MS' if they: (a) reached EDSS {$>$}= 6 within 10 years of symptom onset, (b) EDSS {$>$}=6 was confirmed and sustained over {$>$}=6 months, and (c) EDSS {$>$}=6 was sustained until the end of follow-up. Clinical predictors included patient variables (sex, age at onset, baseline EDSS, disease duration at first visit) and recorded relapses in the first 12 months since disease onset (count, pyramidal signs, bowel-bladder symptoms, cerebellar signs, incomplete relapse recovery, steroid administration, hospitalisation). Predictors were evaluated using Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA). Independent validation was performed using data from the Swedish MS Registry. Of the 2,403 patients identified, 145 were classified as having aggressive MS (6\%). BMA identified three statistical predictors: age {$>$} 35 at symptom onset, EDSS {$>$}= 3 in the first year, and the presence of pyramidal signs in the first year. This model significantly predicted aggressive MS (AUC = .80, 95\% CIs = .75, .84). The presence of all three signs was strongly predictive, with 32\% of such patients meeting aggressive disease criteria. The absence of all three signs was associated with a 1.4\% risk. Of the 556 eligible patients in the Swedish MS Registry cohort, 34 (6\%) met criteria for aggressive MS. The combination of all three signs was also predictive in this cohort (AUC = .75, 95\% CIs = .66, .84). Taken together, these findings suggest that older age at symptom onset, greater disability during the first year, and pyramidal signs in the first year are early indicators of aggressive MS.},

  abstract = {Background: Recent case-control genetic studies of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have implicated common and rare genetic risk alleles, highlighting the polygenic and complex aetiology of this neurodevelopmental disorder. Studies of other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Tourette disorder, developmental delay/intellectual disability, and schizophrenia indicate that identification of specific risk alleles and additional insights into disorder biology can be gained by studying non-inherited de novo variation. In this study, we aimed to identify large de novo copy number variants (CNVs) in children with ADHD.  Methods: Children with a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD and their parents were genotyped and included in this sample. We used PennCNV to call large ({$>$}200kb) CNVs and identified those calls that were present in the proband and absent in both biological parents.  Results: In 305 parent-offspring trios, we detected 14 de novo CNVs in 13 probands, giving a mutation rate of 4.6\% and a per individual rate of 4.3\%. This rate is higher than published reports in controls and similar to those observed for ASD, schizophrenia and Tourette disorder. We also identified de novo mutations at 4 genomic loci (15q13.1-13.2 duplication, 16p13.11 duplication, 16p12.2 deletion and 22q11.21 duplication) that have previously been implicated in other neurodevelopmental disorders, two of which (16p13.11 and 22q11.21) have also been implicated in case-control ADHD studies.  Conclusions: Our study complements ADHD case-control genomic analyses and demonstrates the need for larger parent-offspring trio genetic studies to gain further insights into the complex aetiology of ADHD.},

  abstract = {The kappa statistic is frequently used to test interrater reliability. The importance of rater reliability lies in the fact that it represents the extent to which the data collected in the study are correct representations of the variables measured. Measurement of the extent to which data collectors (raters) assign the same score to the same variable is called interrater reliability. While there have been a variety of methods to measure interrater reliability, traditionally it was measured as percent agreement, calculated as the number of agreement scores divided by the total number of scores. In 1960, Jacob Cohen critiqued use of percent agreement due to its inability to account for chance agreement. He introduced the Cohen's kappa, developed to account for the possibility that raters actually guess on at least some variables due to uncertainty. Like most correlation statistics, the kappa can range from -1 to +1. While the kappa is one of the most commonly used statistics to test interrater reliability, it has limitations. Judgments about what level of kappa should be acceptable for health research are questioned. Cohen's suggested interpretation may be too lenient for health related studies because it implies that a score as low as 0.41 might be acceptable. Kappa and percent agreement are compared, and levels for both kappa and percent agreement that should be demanded in healthcare studies are suggested.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Objective: This study compares the benefits and harms of aspirin for primary prevention before and after widespread use of statins and colorectal cancer screening. Methods: We compared studies of aspirin for primary prevention that recruited patients from 2005 onward with previous individual patient meta-analyses that recruited patients from 1978 to 2002. Data for contemporary studies were synthesized using random-effects models. We report vascular (major adverse cardiovascular events [MACE], myocardial infarction [MI], stroke), bleeding, cancer, and mortality outcomes. Results: The IPD analyses of older studies included 95,456 patients for CV prevention and 25,270 for cancer mortality, while the four newer studies had 61,604 patients. Relative risks for vascular outcomes for older vs newer studies follow: MACE: 0.89 (95\% CI 0.83-0.95) vs 0.93 (0.86-0.99); fatal hemorrhagic stroke: 1.73 (1.11-2.72) vs 1.06 (0.66-1.70); any ischemic stroke: 0.86 (0.74-1.00) vs 0.86 (0.75-0.98); any MI: 0.84 (0.77-0.92) vs 0.88 (0.77-1.00); and non-fatal MI: 0.79 (0.71-0.88) vs 0.94 (0.83-1.08). Cancer death was not significantly decreased in newer studies (RR 1.11, 0.92-1.34). Major hemorrhage was significantly increased for both older and newer studies (RR 1.48, 95\% CI 1.25-1.76 vs 1.37, 95\% CI 1.24-1.53). There was no effect in either group on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, fatal stroke, or fatal MI. Conclusions: In the modern era characterized by widespread statin use and cancer screening, aspirin does not reduce the risk of non-fatal MI or cancer death. There are no mortality benefits and a significant risk of major hemorrhage. Aspirin should no longer be recommended for primary prevention.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Previous research found that reluctance to share data was related to a higher prevalence of statistical errors, often in the direction of statistical significance (Wicherts, Bakker, \&amp; Molenaar, 2011). We therefore hypothesized that journal policies about data sharing and data sharing itself would reduce these inconsistencies. In Study 1, we compared the prevalence of reporting inconsistencies in two similar journals on decision making with different data sharing policies. In Study 2, we compared reporting inconsistencies in psychology articles published in PLOS journals (with a data sharing policy) and Frontiers in Psychology (without a stipulated data sharing policy). In Study 3, we looked at papers published in the journal Psychological Science to check whether papers with or without an Open Practice Badge differed in the prevalence of reporting errors. Overall, we found no relationship between data sharing and reporting inconsistencies. We did find that journal policies on data sharing are extremely effective in promoting data sharing. We argue that open data is essential in improving the quality of psychological science, and we discuss ways to detect and reduce reporting inconsistencies in the literature.},

Participants                170 randomly selected universities from the Leiden ranking of world universities list.                                            Main outcome measure                Presence of five traditional (for example, number of publications) and seven non-traditional (for example, data sharing) criteria in guidelines for assessing assistant professors, associate professors, and professors and the granting of tenure in institutions with biomedical faculties.                                            Results                A total of 146 institutions had faculties of biomedical sciences, and 92 had eligible guidelines available for review. Traditional criteria of peer reviewed publications, authorship order, journal impact factor, grant funding, and national or international reputation were mentioned in 95\% (n=87), 37\% (34), 28\% (26), 67\% (62), and 48\% (44) of the guidelines, respectively. Conversely, among non-traditional criteria, only citations (any mention in 26\%; n=24) and accommodations for employment leave (37\%; 34) were relatively commonly mentioned. Mention of alternative metrics for sharing research (3\%; n=3) and data sharing (1\%; 1) was rare, and three criteria (publishing in open access mediums, registering research, and adhering to reporting guidelines) were not found in any guidelines reviewed. Among guidelines for assessing promotion to full professor, traditional criteria were more commonly reported than non-traditional criteria (traditional criteria 54.2\%, non-traditional items 9.5\%; mean difference 44.8\%, 95\% confidence interval 39.6\% to 50.0\%; P=0.001). Notable differences were observed across continents in whether guidelines were accessible (Australia 100\% (6/6), North America 97\% (28/29), Europe 50\% (27/54), Asia 58\% (29/50), South America 17\% (1/6)), with more subtle differences in the use of specific criteria.                                            Conclusions                This study shows that the evaluation of scientists emphasises traditional criteria as opposed to non-traditional criteria. This may reinforce research practices that are known to be problematic while insufficiently supporting the conduct of better quality research and open science. Institutions should consider incentivising non-traditional criteria.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Active screening for Tuberculosis (TB) is needed to optimize detection and treatment. However, current algorithms for verbal screening perform poorly, causing misclassification that leads to missed cases and unnecessary and costly laboratory tests for false positives. We investigated the role of machine learning to improve the predefined one-size-fits-all algorithm used for scoring the verbal screening questionnaire. We present a cost-sensitive machine learning classification for mass tuberculosis screening. We compared score-based classification defined by clinicians to machine learning classification such as SVM-RBF, logistic regression, and XGBoost. We restricted our analyses to data from adults, the population most affected by TB, and investigated the difference between untuned and unweighted classifiers to the cost-sensitive ones. Predictions were compared with the corresponding GeneXpert MTB/Rif results. After adjusting the weight of the positive class to 40 for XGBoost, we achieved 96.64\% sensitivity and 35.06\% specificity. As such, sensitivity of our identifier increased by 1.26\% while specificity increased by 13.19\% in absolute value compared to the traditional score-based method defined by our clinicians. Our approach further demonstrated that only 2000 data points were sufficient to enable the model to converge. Our results indicate that even with limited data we can actually devise a better method to identify TB suspects from verbal screening. This approach may be a stepping stone towards more effective TB case identification, especially in primary health centres, and foster better detection and control of TB.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {To improve the quality and efficiency of research, groups within the scientific community seek to exploit the value of data sharing. Funders, institutions, and specialist organizations are developing and implementing strategies to encourage or mandate data sharing within and across disciplines, with varying degrees of success. Academic journals in ecology and evolution have adopted several types of public data archiving policies requiring authors to make data underlying scholarly manuscripts freely available. The effort to increase data sharing in the sciences is one part of a broader ``data revolution'' that has prompted discussion about a paradigm shift in scientific research. Yet anecdotes from the community and studies evaluating data availability suggest that these policies have not obtained the desired effects, both in terms of quantity and quality of available datasets. We conducted a qualitative, interview-based study with journal editorial staff and other stakeholders in the academic publishing process to examine how journals enforce data archiving policies. We specifically sought to establish who editors and other stakeholders perceive as responsible for ensuring data completeness and quality in the peer review process. Our analysis revealed little consensus with regard to how data archiving policies should be enforced and who should hold authors accountable for dataset submissions. Themes in interviewee responses included hopefulness that reviewers would take the initiative to review datasets and trust in authors to ensure the completeness and quality of their datasets. We highlight problematic aspects of these thematic responses and offer potential starting points for improvement of the public data archiving process.},

Design A cross-sectional survey of data-sharing policies in 2018 on journal websites and in data-sharing statements in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Setting ICMJE website; PubMed/Medline. Eligibility criteria ICMJE-member journals and 489 ICMJE-affiliated journals that published an RCT in 2018, had an accessible online website and were not considered as predatory journals according to Beall's list. One hundred RCTs for member journals and 100 RCTs for affiliated journals with a data-sharing policy, submitted after 1 July 2018. Main outcome measures The primary outcome for the policies was the existence of a data-sharing policy (explicit data-sharing policy, no data-sharing policy, policy merely referring to ICMJE recommendations) as reported on the journal website, especially in the instructions for authors. For RCTs, our primary outcome was the intention to share individual participant data set out in the data-sharing statement. Results Eight (out of 14; 57\%) member journals had an explicit data-sharing policy on their website (three were more stringent than the ICMJE requirements, one was less demanding and four were compliant), five (35\%) additional journals stated that they followed the ICMJE requirements, and one (8\%) had no policy online. In RCTs published in these journals, there were data-sharing statements in 98 out of 100, with expressed intention to share individual patient data reaching 77 out of 100 (77\%; 95\% CI 67\% to 85\%). One hundred and forty-five (out of 489) ICMJE-affiliated journals (30\%; 26\% to 34\%) had an explicit data-sharing policy on their website (11 were more stringent than the ICMJE requirements, 85 were less demanding and 49 were compliant) and 276 (56\%; 52\% to 61\%) merely referred to the ICMJE requirements. In RCTs published in affiliated journals with an explicit data-sharing policy, data-sharing statements were rare (25\%), and expressed intentions to share data were found in 22\% (15\% to 32\%). Conclusion The implementation of ICMJE data-sharing requirements in online journal policies was suboptimal for ICMJE-member journals and poor for ICMJE-affiliated journals. The implementation of the policy was good in member journals and of concern for affiliated journals. We suggest the conduct of continuous audits of medical journal data-sharing policies in the future.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Background: Chest auscultation is a widely used method in the diagnosis of lung diseases. However, the interpretation of lung sounds is a subjective task and disagreements arise. New technological developments like the use of visual representation of sounds through spectrograms could improve the agreement when classifying lung sounds, but this is not yet known. Aims: To test if the use of spectrograms improves the agreement when classifying wheezes and crackles. Methods: We used 30 lung sounds recordings. The sample contained 15 normal recordings and 15 with wheezes or crackles. We produced spectrograms of the recordings. Twenty-three third to fifth-year medical students at UiT the Arctic University of Norway classified the recordings using an online questionnaire. We first showed the students examples of how wheezes and crackles looked in the spectrogram. Then, we played the recordings in a random order two times, first without the spectrogram, then with live spectrograms displayed. We asked them to classify the sounds for the presence of wheezes and crackles. We calculated kappa values for the agreement between each student and the expert classification with and without display of spectrograms and tested for significant improvement. We also calculated Fleiss kappa for the 23 observers with and without the spectrogram. Results: When classifying wheezes 13/23 (1 with p\&lt;.05) students had a positive change in k, and 16/23 (2 with p\&lt;.05). All the statistically significant changes were in the direction of improved kappa values (.52 - .75). Fleiss kappa values were k=.51 and k=.56 (p=.63) for wheezes without and with spectrograms. For crackles, these values were k=.22 and k=.40 (p{$\leq$}0.01) in the same order. Conclusions: The use of spectrograms had a positive impact on the inter-rater agreement and the agreement with experts. We observed a higher improvement in the classification of crackles compared to wheezes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Research grant providers such as the European Union increasingly require open access publishing of research results and data. However, despite its significance to research, the adoption rate of open data technology remains low across all disciplines, especially in Europe where research has primarily focused on technical solutions (such as Zenodo or the Open Science Framework) or considered only parts of the issue. Methods and findings In this study, we emphasized the non-technical factors perceived value and uncertainty factors in the context of academia, which impact researchers' acceptance of open data\textendash the idea that researchers should not only publish their findings in the form of articles or reports, but also share the corresponding raw data sets. We present the results of a broad quantitative analysis including N = 995 researchers from 13 large to medium-sized universities in Germany. In order to test 11 hypotheses regarding researchers' intentions to share their data, as well as detect any hierarchical or disciplinary differences, we employed a structured equation model (SEM) following the partial least squares (PLS) modeling approach. Conclusions Grounded in the value-based theory, this article proclaims that most individuals in academia embrace open data when the perceived advantages outweigh the disadvantages. Furthermore, uncertainty factors impact the perceived value (consisting of the perceived advantages and disadvantages) of sharing research data. We found that researchers' assumptions about effort required during the data preparation process were diminished by awareness of e-science technologies (such as Zenodo or the Open Science Framework), which also increased their tendency to perceive personal benefits via data exchange. Uncertainty factors seem to influence the intention to share data. Effects differ between disciplines and hierarchical levels.},

Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (MAPC\textregistered ) possess potent immunomodulatory properties which could prove beneficial in minimising subsequent ischaemia reperfusion injury. We investigated the potential reconditioning capability of MAPC cells in kidney NMP. Methods: Pairs (5) of human kidneys from the same donor were simultaneously perfused for 7 hours. The right or left kidney was randomly allocated to receive MAPC treatment. Serial samples of perfusate, urine and tissue biopsies were taken for comparison with the control paired kidney. Results: MAPC-treated kidneys demonstrated improved urine output (p\&lt;0.01), decreased expression of the kidney injury biomarker NGAL (p\&lt;0.01), improved microvascular perfusion on contrast enhanced ultrasound (cortex p\&lt;0.05, medulla p\&lt;0.01), downregulation of IL-1{$\beta$} (p\&lt;0.05) and upregulation of IL-10 (p\&lt;0.05) and Indolamine-2, 3-dioxygenase (p\&lt;0.05). A mouse model of intraperitoneal chemotaxis demonstrated decreased neutrophil recruitment when stimulated with perfusate from MAPC-treated kidneys (p\&lt;0.01). Immunofluorescence revealed pre-labelled MAPC cells home to the perivascular space in the kidneys during NMP. MAPC therapy was not associated with detrimental physiological or embolic events. Conclusion: We report the first successful delivery of cellular therapy to a kidney during NMP. Kidneys treated with MAPC cells demonstrate improvement in clinically relevant functional parameters and injury biomarkers. This novel method of cell therapy delivery provides an exciting opportunity to recondition organs prior to clinical transplantation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Background There is wide agreement in the biomedical research community that research data sharing is a primary ingredient for ensuring that science is more transparent and reproducible. Publishers could play an important role in facilitating and enforcing data sharing; however, many journals have not yet implemented data sharing policies and the requirements vary widely across journals. This study set out to analyze the pervasiveness and quality of data sharing policies in the biomedical literature. Methods The online author's instructions and editorial policies for 318 biomedical journals were manually reviewed to analyze the journal's data sharing requirements and characteristics. The data sharing policies were ranked using a rubric to determine if data sharing was required, recommended, required only for omics data, or not addressed at all. The data sharing method and licensing recommendations were examined, as well any mention of reproducibility or similar concepts. The data was analyzed for patterns relating to publishing volume, Journal Impact Factor, and the publishing model (open access or subscription) of each journal. Results A total of 11.9\% of journals analyzed explicitly stated that data sharing was required as a condition of publication. A total of 9.1\% of journals required data sharing, but did not state that it would affect publication decisions. 23.3\% of journals had a statement encouraging authors to share their data but did not require it. A total of 9.1\% of journals mentioned data sharing indirectly, and only 14.8\% addressed protein, proteomic, and/or genomic data sharing. There was no mention of data sharing in 31.8\% of journals. Impact factors were significantly higher for journals with the strongest data sharing policies compared to all other data sharing criteria. Open access journals were not more likely to require data sharing than subscription journals. Discussion Our study confirmed earlier investigations which observed that only a minority of biomedical journals require data sharing, and a significant association between higher Impact Factors and journals with a data sharing requirement. Moreover, while 65.7\% of the journals in our study that required data sharing addressed the concept of reproducibility, as with earlier investigations, we found that most data sharing policies did not provide specific guidance on the practices that ensure data is maximally available and reusable.},

A diverse set of stakeholders\textemdash representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers\textemdash have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},
