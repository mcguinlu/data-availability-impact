  abstract = {Background: Longer-term feeding studies suggest that a low-carbohydrate diet increases energy expenditure, consistent with the carbohydrate-insulin model of obesity. However, the validity of methodology utilized in these studies, involving doubly-labeled water, has been questioned. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether dietary energy requirement for weight-loss maintenance is higher on a low- versus high-carbohydrate diet. Methods: The study reports secondary outcomes and exploratory analyses from a feeding study in which the primary outcome was total energy expenditure. After attaining a mean Run-in weight loss of 10.5\%, 164 adults with pre-weight-loss BMI of {$\geq$}25 were randomly assigned to Test diets containing Low (20\%), Moderate (40\%) or High (60\%) carbohydrate for 20 weeks. Calorie content of Test diets was adjusted to maintain individual body weight within 2 kg of the post-weight-loss value. In analyses by Intention-to-Treat (ITT, study completers, n=148) and Per Protocol (PP, those achieving the weight-loss maintenance target, n=110), we compared estimated energy requirement from 10 to 20 weeks on the Test diets using ANCOVA. Insulin secretion was assessed pre-weight-loss as insulin concentration 30 minutes following 75 grams oral glucose (Insulin-30). Results: Estimated energy requirement was higher in the Low vs High group by models involving ITT (ranging from 181 [CI 8-353] to 223 [40-406] kcal/d; P{$\leq$};0.04) and PP (ranging from 245 [43-446] to 295 [91-499] kcal/d; P{$\leq$};0.02). This difference remained significant in sensitivity analyses accounting for change in adiposity and possible non-adherence. In observational analyses, pre-weight loss Insulin-30 predicted adverse change in body composition following weight loss. Conclusions: Energy requirement was higher on a low- versus high-carbohydrate diet during weight-loss maintenance, commensurate with total energy expenditure. These data are consistent with the carbohydrate-insulin model and lend qualified support for the validity of the doubly-labeled water method with diets varying in macronutrient composition.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Background: Clinical trial recruitment is often the rate-limiting step in the development of new treatments reaching patients across all disease states. With more than 1500 currently available clinical trials for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) patients, it is important to understand patient perceptions of clinical trial participation to improve recruitment and retention. This study aimed to examine the specific challenges and barriers that might be reducing IBD patient enrollment and potential methods to overcome these barriers. Methods: Five in-person patient focus groups were conducted from February through May 2016 using two facilitation guides. Participants self-reported a diagnosis of Crohns disease or ulcerative colitis. Results: The five focus groups included a total of 34 participants. Participants discussed several barriers, including fears, disease severity at trial onset, potential adverse effects, time constraints, and the influence of both their primary IBD provider and support network. Methods to improve participation included better communication to prospective patients, reduced length of trial and time commitment, lower placebo rates, the option of open label extension, and support of the patient primary IBD provider. Conclusions: This is the first study to examine patient perceptions for IBD clinical trial enrollment, including barriers to participation and methods to improve participation. Fear and misunderstanding of clinical trials, engagement with providers, limiting time demands, and limiting the impact on work and family were found to be barriers to participation. Creative solutions to these problems could lead to greater participation in trials and more rapid advancement of new therapies to clinical approval and use.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In clinical research patient privacy and consent for use of personal health information are key considerations, but agreed-upon definitions of what constitutes anonymised patient information do not appear to have been established.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Background: Red and processed meat has been consistently associated with risk for colorectal cancer, but evidence for other cancer sites is limited and few studies have examined the association between poultry intake and cancer risk. We examined associations between total meat, red meat, processed meat and poultry intake and incidence for 20 common cancer sites. Methods and Findings: We analysed data from 475,023 participants (54\% women) in UK Biobank. Participants were aged 37 73 years and cancer free at baseline. Information on meat consumption was based on a touchscreen questionnaire completed at baseline covering type and frequency of meat intake. Diet intake was re-measured a minimum of three times in a subsample (15\%) using a web-based 24h dietary recall questionnaire. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the association between baseline meat intake and cancer incidence. Trends in risk across baseline meat intake categories were calculated by assigning a mean value to each category using estimates from the re-measured meat intakes. During a mean follow-up of 6.9 years, 28,955 participants were diagnosed with a malignant cancer. Total, red and processed meat intakes were each positively associated with risk of colorectal cancer (e.g. hazard ratio (HR) per 70 g/day higher intake of red and processed meat combined 1.31, 95\%-confidence interval (CI) 1.14-1.52). Red meat intake was positively associated with breast cancer (HR per 50 g/day higher intake 1.12, 1.01-1.24) and prostate cancer (1.15, 1.03-1.29). Poultry intake was positively associated with risk for cancers of the lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues (HR per 30g/day higher intake 1.16, 1.03-1.32). Only the associations with colorectal cancer were robust to Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Study limitations include unrepresentativeness of the study sample for the UK population, low case numbers for less common cancers and the possibility of residual confounding. Conclusions: Higher intakes of red and processed meat were associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer. The observed positive associations of red meat consumption with breast and prostate cancer, and poultry intake with cancers of the lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues, require further investigation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Patients with the 'aggressive' form of MS accrue disability at an accelerated rate, typically reaching EDSS {$>$}= 6 within 10 years of symptom onset. Several clinicodemographic factors have been associated with aggressive MS, but less research has focused on clinical markers that are present in the first year of disease. The development of early predictive models of aggressive MS is essential to optimise treatment in this MS subtype. We evaluated whether patients who will develop severe MS can be identified based on early clinical markers, and to replicate this analysis in an independent cohort. Patient data were obtained from MSBase. Inclusion criteria were (a) first recorded disability score (EDSS) within 12 months of symptom onset, (b) at least 2 recorded EDSS scores, and (c) at least 10 years of observation time. Patients were classified as having 'aggressive MS' if they: (a) reached EDSS {$>$}= 6 within 10 years of symptom onset, (b) EDSS {$>$}=6 was confirmed and sustained over {$>$}=6 months, and (c) EDSS {$>$}=6 was sustained until the end of follow-up. Clinical predictors included patient variables (sex, age at onset, baseline EDSS, disease duration at first visit) and recorded relapses in the first 12 months since disease onset (count, pyramidal signs, bowel-bladder symptoms, cerebellar signs, incomplete relapse recovery, steroid administration, hospitalisation). Predictors were evaluated using Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA). Independent validation was performed using data from the Swedish MS Registry. Of the 2,403 patients identified, 145 were classified as having aggressive MS (6\%). BMA identified three statistical predictors: age {$>$} 35 at symptom onset, EDSS {$>$}= 3 in the first year, and the presence of pyramidal signs in the first year. This model significantly predicted aggressive MS (AUC = .80, 95\% CIs = .75, .84). The presence of all three signs was strongly predictive, with 32\% of such patients meeting aggressive disease criteria. The absence of all three signs was associated with a 1.4\% risk. Of the 556 eligible patients in the Swedish MS Registry cohort, 34 (6\%) met criteria for aggressive MS. The combination of all three signs was also predictive in this cohort (AUC = .75, 95\% CIs = .66, .84). Taken together, these findings suggest that older age at symptom onset, greater disability during the first year, and pyramidal signs in the first year are early indicators of aggressive MS.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Objective: This study compares the benefits and harms of aspirin for primary prevention before and after widespread use of statins and colorectal cancer screening. Methods: We compared studies of aspirin for primary prevention that recruited patients from 2005 onward with previous individual patient meta-analyses that recruited patients from 1978 to 2002. Data for contemporary studies were synthesized using random-effects models. We report vascular (major adverse cardiovascular events [MACE], myocardial infarction [MI], stroke), bleeding, cancer, and mortality outcomes. Results: The IPD analyses of older studies included 95,456 patients for CV prevention and 25,270 for cancer mortality, while the four newer studies had 61,604 patients. Relative risks for vascular outcomes for older vs newer studies follow: MACE: 0.89 (95\% CI 0.83-0.95) vs 0.93 (0.86-0.99); fatal hemorrhagic stroke: 1.73 (1.11-2.72) vs 1.06 (0.66-1.70); any ischemic stroke: 0.86 (0.74-1.00) vs 0.86 (0.75-0.98); any MI: 0.84 (0.77-0.92) vs 0.88 (0.77-1.00); and non-fatal MI: 0.79 (0.71-0.88) vs 0.94 (0.83-1.08). Cancer death was not significantly decreased in newer studies (RR 1.11, 0.92-1.34). Major hemorrhage was significantly increased for both older and newer studies (RR 1.48, 95\% CI 1.25-1.76 vs 1.37, 95\% CI 1.24-1.53). There was no effect in either group on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, fatal stroke, or fatal MI. Conclusions: In the modern era characterized by widespread statin use and cancer screening, aspirin does not reduce the risk of non-fatal MI or cancer death. There are no mortality benefits and a significant risk of major hemorrhage. Aspirin should no longer be recommended for primary prevention.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Active screening for Tuberculosis (TB) is needed to optimize detection and treatment. However, current algorithms for verbal screening perform poorly, causing misclassification that leads to missed cases and unnecessary and costly laboratory tests for false positives. We investigated the role of machine learning to improve the predefined one-size-fits-all algorithm used for scoring the verbal screening questionnaire. We present a cost-sensitive machine learning classification for mass tuberculosis screening. We compared score-based classification defined by clinicians to machine learning classification such as SVM-RBF, logistic regression, and XGBoost. We restricted our analyses to data from adults, the population most affected by TB, and investigated the difference between untuned and unweighted classifiers to the cost-sensitive ones. Predictions were compared with the corresponding GeneXpert MTB/Rif results. After adjusting the weight of the positive class to 40 for XGBoost, we achieved 96.64\% sensitivity and 35.06\% specificity. As such, sensitivity of our identifier increased by 1.26\% while specificity increased by 13.19\% in absolute value compared to the traditional score-based method defined by our clinicians. Our approach further demonstrated that only 2000 data points were sufficient to enable the model to converge. Our results indicate that even with limited data we can actually devise a better method to identify TB suspects from verbal screening. This approach may be a stepping stone towards more effective TB case identification, especially in primary health centres, and foster better detection and control of TB.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Objective To explore the implementation of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) data-sharing policy which came into force on 1 July 2018 by ICMJE-member journals and by ICMJE-affiliated journals declaring they follow the ICMJE recommendations.
Design A cross-sectional survey of data-sharing policies in 2018 on journal websites and in data-sharing statements in randomised controlled trials (RCTs).
Setting ICMJE website; PubMed/Medline.
Eligibility criteria ICMJE-member journals and 489 ICMJE-affiliated journals that published an RCT in 2018, had an accessible online website and were not considered as predatory journals according to Beall's list. One hundred RCTs for member journals and 100 RCTs for affiliated journals with a data-sharing policy, submitted after 1 July 2018.
Main outcome measures The primary outcome for the policies was the existence of a data-sharing policy (explicit data-sharing policy, no data-sharing policy, policy merely referring to ICMJE recommendations) as reported on the journal website, especially in the instructions for authors. For RCTs, our primary outcome was the intention to share individual participant data set out in the data-sharing statement.
Results Eight (out of 14; 57\%) member journals had an explicit data-sharing policy on their website (three were more stringent than the ICMJE requirements, one was less demanding and four were compliant), five (35\%) additional journals stated that they followed the ICMJE requirements, and one (8\%) had no policy online. In RCTs published in these journals, there were data-sharing statements in 98 out of 100, with expressed intention to share individual patient data reaching 77 out of 100 (77\%; 95\% CI 67\% to 85\%). One hundred and forty-five (out of 489) ICMJE-affiliated journals (30\%; 26\% to 34\%) had an explicit data-sharing policy on their website (11 were more stringent than the ICMJE requirements, 85 were less demanding and 49 were compliant) and 276 (56\%; 52\% to 61\%) merely referred to the ICMJE requirements. In RCTs published in affiliated journals with an explicit data-sharing policy, data-sharing statements were rare (25\%), and expressed intentions to share data were found in 22\% (15\% to 32\%).
Conclusion The implementation of ICMJE data-sharing requirements in online journal policies was suboptimal for ICMJE-member journals and poor for ICMJE-affiliated journals. The implementation of the policy was good in member journals and of concern for affiliated journals. We suggest the conduct of continuous audits of medical journal data-sharing policies in the future.

However, the interpretation of lung sounds is a subjective task and disagreements arise. New technological developments like the use of visual representation of sounds through spectrograms could improve the agreement when classifying lung sounds, but this is not yet known. Aims: To test if the use of spectrograms improves the agreement when classifying wheezes and crackles. Methods: We used 30 lung sounds recordings. The sample contained 15 normal recordings and 15 with wheezes or crackles. We produced spectrograms of the recordings. Twenty-three third to fifth-year medical students at UiT the Arctic University of Norway classified the recordings using an online questionnaire. We first showed the students examples of how wheezes and crackles looked in the spectrogram. Then, we played the recordings in a random order two times, first without the spectrogram, then with live spectrograms displayed. We asked them to classify the sounds for the presence of wheezes and crackles. We calculated kappa values for the agreement between each student and the expert classification with and without display of spectrograms and tested for significant improvement. We also calculated Fleiss kappa for the 23 observers with and without the spectrogram. Results: When classifying wheezes 13/23 (1 with p\&lt;.05) students had a positive change in k, and 16/23 (2 with p\&lt;.05). All the statistically significant changes were in the direction of improved kappa values (.52 - .75). Fleiss kappa values were k=.51 and k=.56 (p=.63) for wheezes without and with spectrograms. For crackles, these values were k=.22 and k=.40 (p{$\leq$}0.01) in the same order. Conclusions: The use of spectrograms had a positive impact on the inter-rater agreement and the agreement with experts. We observed a higher improvement in the classification of crackles compared to wheezes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Abstract: Ex-vivo normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) of donor kidneys prior to transplantation provides a platform for direct delivery of cellular therapeutics to optimise organ quality prior to transplantation. Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (MAPC\textregistered ) possess potent immunomodulatory properties which could prove beneficial in minimising subsequent ischaemia reperfusion injury. We investigated the potential reconditioning capability of MAPC cells in kidney NMP. Methods: Pairs (5) of human kidneys from the same donor were simultaneously perfused for 7 hours. The right or left kidney was randomly allocated to receive MAPC treatment. Serial samples of perfusate, urine and tissue biopsies were taken for comparison with the control paired kidney. Results: MAPC-treated kidneys demonstrated improved urine output (p\&lt;0.01), decreased expression of the kidney injury biomarker NGAL (p\&lt;0.01), improved microvascular perfusion on contrast enhanced ultrasound (cortex p\&lt;0.05, medulla p\&lt;0.01), downregulation of IL-1{$\beta$} (p\&lt;0.05) and upregulation of IL-10 (p\&lt;0.05) and Indolamine-2, 3-dioxygenase (p\&lt;0.05). A mouse model of intraperitoneal chemotaxis demonstrated decreased neutrophil recruitment when stimulated with perfusate from MAPC-treated kidneys (p\&lt;0.01). Immunofluorescence revealed pre-labelled MAPC cells home to the perivascular space in the kidneys during NMP. MAPC therapy was not associated with detrimental physiological or embolic events. Conclusion: We report the first successful delivery of cellular therapy to a kidney during NMP. Kidneys treated with MAPC cells demonstrate improvement in clinically relevant functional parameters and injury biomarkers. This novel method of cell therapy delivery provides an exciting opportunity to recondition organs prior to clinical transplantation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},
