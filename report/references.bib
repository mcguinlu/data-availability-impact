  abstract = {This white paper, published by Springer Nature, provides a novel, quantitative and qualitative perspective on open science in Japan in 2018. It summarises the findings of a survey with more than 1,000 researchers in Japan, looking at the challenges and opportunities for data sharing in the region. The underlying dataset of the survey is available openly on Figshare: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6328952.v1{$<$}br{$>$}The related Infographic on
challenges and opportunities for Japanese researchers is also available on
Figshare: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6609056.v1{$<$}br{$>$}

 

The
report also includes expert perspectives in the form of a summary of a
roundtable discussion with key opinion leaders in the Japanese research
community and representatives of major funding organisations, chaired by
Springer Nature in Tokyo in 2018, and an interview with AMED, a funder of
medical research in Japan, providing a more in-depth account of their
innovative approach to sharing medical research data from rare diseases.{$<$}br{$>$}

 

The
survey and analysis builds on a previous 2017 survey of more than 7,000
researchers worldwide, regarding data sharing at the point of submitting an
article for publication (see details of 'Practical challenges for researchers
in data sharing' below). This 2018 survey aims to fill a gap in the previous
work where relatively few responses were received from China and Japan.{$<$}br{$>$}Data were collected in online surveys conducted in English and Japanese in 2018. In total, 1,393 responses were received from active researchers (academic, scientific or clinical) in Japan.{$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$}Similar research was conducted in China in 2019 and summarised in an online white paper, linked below.{$<$}br{$>$}\textbf{Practical Challenges for Researchers in Data Sharing}White paper: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5975011Full survey dataset: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5971387.v2Infographic: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5996786.v4{$<$}br{$>$}\textbf{The State of Open Data Report 2018}White paper: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7195058.v2Full survey dataset: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7234985.v1Interactive data: https://knowledge.figshare.com/articles/item/state-of-open-data-2018{$<$}br{$>$}\textbf{Challenges and Opportunities for Data Sharing in China}White paper: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7718441.v1Full survey dataset: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7321604.v1Infographic: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7782761},

  abstract = {Despite the increase in the number of journals issuing data policies requiring authors to make data underlying reporting findings publicly available, authors do not always do so, and when they do, the data do not always meet standards of quality that allow others to verify or extend published results. This phenomenon suggests the need to consider the effectiveness of journal data policies to present and articulate transparency requirements, and how well they facilitate (or hinder) authors' ability to produce and provide access to data, code, and associated materials that meet quality standards for computational reproducibility. This article describes the results of a research study that examined the ability of journal-based data policies to: 1) effectively communicate transparency requirements to authors, and 2) enable authors to successfully meet policy requirements. To do this, we conducted a mixed-methods study that examined individual data policies alongside editors' and authors' interpretation of policy requirements to answer the following research questions. Survey responses from authors and editors along with results from a content analysis of data policies found discrepancies among editors' assertion of data policy requirements, authors' understanding of policy requirements, and the requirements stated in the policy language as written. We offer explanations for these discrepancies and offer recommendations for improving authors' understanding of policies and increasing the likelihood of policy compliance.},

  abstract = {Purpose
              Taking the researchers' perspective, the purpose of this paper is to examine the types of context information needed to preserve data's meaning in ways that support data reuse.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This paper is based on a qualitative study of 105 researchers from three disciplinary communities: quantitative social science, archaeology and zoology. The study focused on researchers' most recent data reuse experience, particularly what they needed when deciding whether to reuse data.
            
            
              Findings
              Findings show that researchers mentioned 12 types of context information across three broad categories: data production information (data collection, specimen and artifact, data producer, data analysis, missing data, and research objectives); repository information (provenance, reputation and history, curation and digitization); and data reuse information (prior reuse, advice on reuse and terms of use).
            
            
              Originality/value
              This paper extends digital curation conversations to include the preservation of context as well as content to facilitate data reuse. When compared to prior research, findings show that there is some generalizability with respect to the types of context needed across different disciplines and data sharing and reuse environments. It also introduces several new context types. Relying on the perspective of researchers offers a more nuanced view that shows the importance of the different context types for each discipline and the ways disciplinary members thought about them. Both data producers and curators can benefit from knowing what to capture and manage during data collection and deposit into a repository.},

  abstract = {Objective To investigate clinical trialists' opinions and experiences of sharing of clinical trial data with investigators who are not directly collaborating with the research team.
Design and setting Cross sectional, web based survey.
Participants Clinical trialists who were corresponding authors of clinical trials published in 2010 or 2011 in one of six general medical journals with the highest impact factor in 2011.
Main outcome measures Support for and prevalence of data sharing through data repositories and in response to individual requests, concerns with data sharing through repositories, and reasons for granting or denying requests.
Results Of 683 potential respondents, 317 completed the survey (response rate 46\%). In principle, 236 (74\%) thought that sharing de-identified data through data repositories should be required, and 229 (72\%) thought that investigators should be required to share de-identified data in response to individual requests. In practice, only 56 (18\%) indicated that they were required by the trial funder to deposit the trial data in a repository; of these 32 (57\%) had done so. In all, 149 respondents (47\%) had received an individual request to share their clinical trial data; of these, 115 (77\%) had granted and 56 (38\%) had denied at least one request. Respondents' most common concerns about data sharing were related to appropriate data use, investigator or funder interests, and protection of research subjects.
Conclusions We found strong support for sharing clinical trial data among corresponding authors of recently published trials in high impact general medical journals who responded to our survey, including a willingness to share data, although several practical concerns were identified.},

Scopus and Web of Science can both be used for forwards citation searching but there is little evidence comparing the resources for this purpose. Method 104 source records relevant to a scoping review of implementation and dissemination strategies in dementia care were checked for inclusion on Web of Science and Scopus. The number of citing references was recorded. Where citing references appeared unique to one of the resources, they were checked for inclusion on the other resource to assess the performance of citation links. Results 1397 citing references were returned by Scopus and 1010 were returned by Web of Science. For the unique citing references returned by Web of Science (n = 52), 36 were subsequently found to be on Scopus but had failed to be picked up as citing a source record. Of the unique citing references returned by Scopus (n = 355), 83 were found to be on Web of Science but had failed to be picked up as citing a source record. 26 additional relevant records were identified for the review by forwards citation searching. All were found on Scopus; six would have been missed by searching Web of Science alone. Conclusion Citation searching using Scopus alone would have found all additional relevant studies for the review.

  abstract = {Background Scientific research in the 21st century is more data intensive and collaborative than in the past. It is important to study the data practices of researchers \textendash{} data accessibility, discovery, re-use, preservation and, particularly, data sharing. Data sharing is a valuable part of the scientific method allowing for verification of results and extending research from prior results. Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 1329 scientists participated in this survey exploring current data sharing practices and perceptions of the barriers and enablers of data sharing. Scientists do not make their data electronically available to others for various reasons, including insufficient time and lack of funding. Most respondents are satisfied with their current processes for the initial and short-term parts of the data or research lifecycle (collecting their research data; searching for, describing or cataloging, analyzing, and short-term storage of their data) but are not satisfied with long-term data preservation. Many organizations do not provide support to their researchers for data management both in the short- and long-term. If certain conditions are met (such as formal citation and sharing reprints) respondents agree they are willing to share their data. There are also significant differences and approaches in data management practices based on primary funding agency, subject discipline, age, work focus, and world region. Conclusions/Significance Barriers to effective data sharing and preservation are deeply rooted in the practices and culture of the research process as well as the researchers themselves. New mandates for data management plans from NSF and other federal agencies and world-wide attention to the need to share and preserve data could lead to changes. Large scale programs, such as the NSF-sponsored DataNET (including projects like DataONE) will both bring attention and resources to the issue and make it easier for scientists to apply sound data management principles.},

  abstract = {Background With data becoming a centerpiece of modern scientific discovery, data sharing by scientists is now a crucial element of scientific progress. This article aims to provide an in-depth examination of the practices and perceptions of data management, including data storage, data sharing, and data use and reuse by scientists around the world. Methods The Usability and Assessment Working Group of DataONE, an NSF-funded environmental cyberinfrastructure project, distributed a survey to a multinational and multidisciplinary sample of scientific researchers in a two-waves approach in 2017\textendash 2018. We focused our analysis on examining the differences across age groups, sub-disciplines of science, and sectors of employment. Findings Most respondents displayed what we describe as high and mediocre risk data practices by storing their data on their personal computer, departmental servers or USB drives. Respondents appeared to be satisfied with short-term storage solutions; however, only half of them are satisfied with available mechanisms for storing data beyond the life of the process. Data sharing and data reuse were viewed positively: over 85\% of respondents admitted they would be willing to share their data with others and said they would use data collected by others if it could be easily accessed. A vast majority of respondents felt that the lack of access to data generated by other researchers or institutions was a major impediment to progress in science at large, yet only about a half thought that it restricted their own ability to answer scientific questions. Although attitudes towards data sharing and data use and reuse are mostly positive, practice does not always support data storage, sharing, and future reuse. Assistance through data managers or data librarians, readily available data repositories for both long-term and short-term storage, and educational programs for both awareness and to help engender good data practices are clearly needed.},
