  abstract = {This white paper, published by Springer Nature, provides a novel, quantitative and qualitative perspective on open science in Japan in 2018. It summarises the findings of a survey with more than 1,000 researchers in Japan, looking at the challenges and opportunities for data sharing in the region. The underlying dataset of the survey is available openly on Figshare: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6328952.v1{$<$}br{$>$}The related Infographic on challenges and opportunities for Japanese researchers is also available on Figshare: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.6609056.v1{$<$}br{$>$}   The report also includes expert perspectives in the form of a summary of a roundtable discussion with key opinion leaders in the Japanese research community and representatives of major funding organisations, chaired by Springer Nature in Tokyo in 2018, and an interview with AMED, a funder of medical research in Japan, providing a more in-depth account of their innovative approach to sharing medical research data from rare diseases.{$<$}br{$>$}   The survey and analysis builds on a previous 2017 survey of more than 7,000 researchers worldwide, regarding data sharing at the point of submitting an article for publication (see details of 'Practical challenges for researchers in data sharing' below).

  abstract = {Data sharing is increasingly mandated by health research funders and publishers. In the context of data collected in low-resource settings, concerns have been raised regarding inequitable opportunities to engage in secondary use of data between researchers in well-resourced and resource-limited settings. In this context, we present three case studies and their issues related to equity: the multicountry Antenatal Corticosteroid Trial, health research in the Dominican Repulic and the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network. These case studies were discussed at the 2018 Global Forum for Bioethics in Research in South Africa, focussing on the theme ``The ethics of data sharing and biobanking in health research''. The case studies provide concrete examples of real challenges such as lack of prior consent for data sharing, potential for misinterpretation of data by secondary users and limited capacity of researchers in low-resource settings to conduct secondary analyses. We conclude by suggesting ways forward. We stress the importance of capacity building and investments in data management and data science skills, and in data sharing platforms supporting poverty-related disease research. In addition, we recommend that there should be incentives to promote data sharing and that research groups and institutions establish their own data sharing policies ~tailored to their context, data and community while persuing harmonization with existing policies as much as possible. We also think that international guidelines on authorship criteria should be revisited. For new studies, researchers should obtain consent for sharing of participants' data with secondary users. Lastly we recommend that community and stakeholder engagement be conducted to improve the consent process and identify what might be sensitive data to mitigate any potential harms to data subjects and their communities.},

  abstract = {Despite the increase in the number of journals issuing data policies requiring authors to make data underlying reporting findings publicly available, authors do not always do so, and when they do, the data do not always meet standards of quality that allow others to verify or extend published results. This phenomenon suggests the need to consider the effectiveness of journal data policies to present and articulate transparency requirements, and how well they facilitate (or hinder) authors' ability to produce and provide access to data, code, and associated materials that meet quality standards for computational reproducibility. This article describes the results of a research study that examined the ability of journal-based data policies to: 1) effectively communicate transparency requirements to authors, and 2) enable authors to successfully meet policy requirements. To do this, we conducted a mixed-methods study that examined individual data policies alongside editors' and authors' interpretation of policy requirements to answer the following research questions. Survey responses from authors and editors along with results from a content analysis of data policies found discrepancies among editors' assertion of data policy requirements, authors' understanding of policy requirements, and the requirements stated in the policy language as written. We offer explanations for these discrepancies and offer recommendations for improving authors' understanding of policies and increasing the likelihood of policy compliance.},

  abstract = {Purpose               Taking the researchers' perspective, the purpose of this paper is to examine the types of context information needed to preserve data's meaning in ways that support data reuse.                                         Design/methodology/approach               This paper is based on a qualitative study of 105 researchers from three disciplinary communities: quantitative social science, archaeology and zoology. The study focused on researchers' most recent data reuse experience, particularly what they needed when deciding whether to reuse data.                                         Findings               Findings show that researchers mentioned 12 types of context information across three broad categories: data production information (data collection, specimen and artifact, data producer, data analysis, missing data, and research objectives); repository information (provenance, reputation and history, curation and digitization); and data reuse information (prior reuse, advice on reuse and terms of use).                                         Originality/value               This paper extends digital curation conversations to include the preservation of context as well as content to facilitate data reuse. When compared to prior research, findings show that there is some generalizability with respect to the types of context needed across different disciplines and data sharing and reuse environments. It also introduces several new context types. Relying on the perspective of researchers offers a more nuanced view that shows the importance of the different context types for each discipline and the ways disciplinary members thought about them. Both data producers and curators can benefit from knowing what to capture and manage during data collection and deposit into a repository.},

It would maximise the use of data and permit the exploration of additional hypotheses. On the other hand, the quality of secondary analyses cannot always be ascertained, and it may be unfair to investigators who have expended resources to collect data to bear the additional burden of sharing. As the discussion on the best modalities of sharing data evolves, some of the practical issues that may arise need to be addressed. In this paper, we discuss issues which impede the use of data even when sharing should be possible: (1) multicentre studies requiring consent from all the investigators in each centre; (2) remote access platforms with software limitations and Internet requirements; (3) on-site data analysis when data cannot be moved; (4) governing bodies for data generated in one jurisdiction and analysed in another; (5) using programmatic data collected as part of routine care; (6) data collected in multiple languages; (7) poor data quality. We believe these issues apply to all primary data and cause undue difficulties in conducting analysis even when there is some willingness to share. They can be avoided by anticipating the possibility of sharing any clinical data and pre-emptively removing or addressing restrictions that limit complete sharing. These issues should be part of the data sharing discussion.},

Design and setting Cross sectional, web based survey. Participants Clinical trialists who were corresponding authors of clinical trials published in 2010 or 2011 in one of six general medical journals with the highest impact factor in 2011. Main outcome measures Support for and prevalence of data sharing through data repositories and in response to individual requests, concerns with data sharing through repositories, and reasons for granting or denying requests. Results Of 683 potential respondents, 317 completed the survey (response rate 46\%). In principle, 236 (74\%) thought that sharing de-identified data through data repositories should be required, and 229 (72\%) thought that investigators should be required to share de-identified data in response to individual requests. In practice, only 56 (18\%) indicated that they were required by the trial funder to deposit the trial data in a repository; of these 32 (57\%) had done so. In all, 149 respondents (47\%) had received an individual request to share their clinical trial data; of these, 115 (77\%) had granted and 56 (38\%) had denied at least one request. Respondents' most common concerns about data sharing were related to appropriate data use, investigator or funder interests, and protection of research subjects. Conclusions We found strong support for sharing clinical trial data among corresponding authors of recently published trials in high impact general medical journals who responded to our survey, including a willingness to share data, although several practical concerns were identified.},

Scopus and Web of Science can both be used for forwards citation searching but there is little evidence comparing the resources for this purpose. Method 104 source records relevant to a scoping review of implementation and dissemination strategies in dementia care were checked for inclusion on Web of Science and Scopus. The number of citing references was recorded. Where citing references appeared unique to one of the resources, they were checked for inclusion on the other resource to assess the performance of citation links. Results 1397 citing references were returned by Scopus and 1010 were returned by Web of Science. For the unique citing references returned by Web of Science (n = 52), 36 were subsequently found to be on Scopus but had failed to be picked up as citing a source record. Of the unique citing references returned by Scopus (n = 355), 83 were found to be on Web of Science but had failed to be picked up as citing a source record. 26 additional relevant records were identified for the review by forwards citation searching. All were found on Scopus; six would have been missed by searching Web of Science alone. Conclusion Citation searching using Scopus alone would have found all additional relevant studies for the review. Both Scopus and Web of Science failed to return all citing references from the source records, even where they were present on the database, indicating poor links between citations.},

It is important to study the data practices of researchers \textendash{} data accessibility, discovery, re-use, preservation and, particularly, data sharing. Data sharing is a valuable part of the scientific method allowing for verification of results and extending research from prior results. Methodology/Principal Findings A total of 1329 scientists participated in this survey exploring current data sharing practices and perceptions of the barriers and enablers of data sharing. Scientists do not make their data electronically available to others for various reasons, including insufficient time and lack of funding. Most respondents are satisfied with their current processes for the initial and short-term parts of the data or research lifecycle (collecting their research data; searching for, describing or cataloging, analyzing, and short-term storage of their data) but are not satisfied with long-term data preservation. Many organizations do not provide support to their researchers for data management both in the short- and long-term. If certain conditions are met (such as formal citation and sharing reprints) respondents agree they are willing to share their data. There are also significant differences and approaches in data management practices based on primary funding agency, subject discipline, age, work focus, and world region. Conclusions/Significance Barriers to effective data sharing and preservation are deeply rooted in the practices and culture of the research process as well as the researchers themselves. New mandates for data management plans from NSF and other federal agencies and world-wide attention to the need to share and preserve data could lead to changes. Large scale programs, such as the NSF-sponsored DataNET (including projects like DataONE) will both bring attention and resources to the issue and make it easier for scientists to apply sound data management principles.},

This article aims to provide an in-depth examination of the practices and perceptions of data management, including data storage, data sharing, and data use and reuse by scientists around the world. Methods The Usability and Assessment Working Group of DataONE, an NSF-funded environmental cyberinfrastructure project, distributed a survey to a multinational and multidisciplinary sample of scientific researchers in a two-waves approach in 2017\textendash 2018. We focused our analysis on examining the differences across age groups, sub-disciplines of science, and sectors of employment. Findings Most respondents displayed what we describe as high and mediocre risk data practices by storing their data on their personal computer, departmental servers or USB drives. Respondents appeared to be satisfied with short-term storage solutions; however, only half of them are satisfied with available mechanisms for storing data beyond the life of the process. Data sharing and data reuse were viewed positively: over 85\% of respondents admitted they would be willing to share their data with others and said they would use data collected by others if it could be easily accessed. A vast majority of respondents felt that the lack of access to data generated by other researchers or institutions was a major impediment to progress in science at large, yet only about a half thought that it restricted their own ability to answer scientific questions. Although attitudes towards data sharing and data use and reuse are mostly positive, practice does not always support data storage, sharing, and future reuse. Assistance through data managers or data librarians, readily available data repositories for both long-term and short-term storage, and educational programs for both awareness and to help engender good data practices are clearly needed.},

Exploring the reasons behind these findings, we offer seven specific recommendations for engineering and incentivizing improved practices, so that the potential of open data can be better realized across psychology and social science more generally.},

We scanned the reference list of all NCCN guidelines (n = 49) for potential systematic reviews and meta-analyses. All retrieved studies were screened, and data were extracted, independently and in duplicate. The analysis was carried out between May 6, 2018, and January 28, 2019.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Main Outcomes and Measures{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}The frequency of reproducible research practices, defined as (1) effect estimate and measure of precision (eg, hazard ratio with 95\% confidence interval); (2) clear list of studies included for each analysis; and (3) for subgroup and sensitivity analyses, it must be clear which studies were included in each group or level.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Results{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}We identified 1124 potential systematic reviews, and 154 meta-analyses comprising 3696 meta-analytic effect size estimates were included. Only 2375 of the 3696 meta-analytic estimates (64.3\%), including subgroup and sensitivity analyses, were reproducible in theory. Forest plots appear to improve the reproducibility of meta-analyses. All meta-analytic estimates were reproducible in theory in 100 systematic reviews (64.9\%), and in 15 systematic reviews (9.7\%), no meta-analytic estimates could potentially be reproduced. Data were said to be imputed in 29 meta-analyses, but none specified which data. Only 1 meta-analysis included a link to an online data set.{$<$}/p{$><$}h3{$>$}Conclusions and Relevance{$<$}/h3{$><$}p{$>$}More reproducible research practices are needed in oncology meta-analyses, as suggested by those that are cited by the NCCN.

A diverse set of stakeholders\textemdash representing academia, industry, funding agencies, and scholarly publishers\textemdash have come together to design and jointly endorse a concise and measureable set of principles that we refer to as the FAIR Data Principles. The intent is that these may act as a guideline for those wishing to enhance the reusability of their data holdings. Distinct from peer initiatives that focus on the human scholar, the FAIR Principles put specific emphasis on enhancing the ability of machines to automatically find and use the data, in addition to supporting its reuse by individuals. This Comment is the first formal publication of the FAIR Principles, and includes the rationale behind them, and some exemplar implementations in the community.},

  abstract = {Author summary Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.},
