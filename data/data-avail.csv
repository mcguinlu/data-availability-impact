65,"Molecular profiling of neonatal dried blood spots reveals changes in innate and adaptive immunity following fetal inflammatory response","The fetal inflammatory response (FIR) increases the risk of perinatal brain injury, particularly in extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGANs, < 28 weeks of gestation). One of the mechanisms contributing to such a risk is a postnatal intermittent or sustained systemic inflammation (ISSI) following FIR. The link between prenatal and postnatal systemic inflammation is supported by the presence of well-established inflammatory biomarkers in the umbilical cord and peripheral blood. However, the extent of molecular changes contributing to this association is unknown. Using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry proteomics, we profiled the transcriptome and proteome of archived neonatal dried blood spot (DBS) specimens from 21 ELGANs. Comparing FIR-affected and unaffected ELGANs, we identified 783 gene and 27 protein expression changes of 50% magnitude or more, and an experiment-wide significance level below 5% false discovery rate. These expression changes confirm the robust postnatal activation of the innate immune system in FIR-affected ELGANs and reveal an impairment of their adaptive immunity. In turn, the altered pathways provide clues about the molecular mechanisms triggering ISSI after FIR, and the onset of perinatal brain injury.","Costa, D.; Bonet, N.; Sole, A.; Gonzalez De Aledo-Castillo, J.

5,"Prospective and External Evaluation of a Machine Learning Model to Predict In-Hospital Mortality","The ability to accurately predict in-hospital mortality for patients at the time of admission could improve clinical and operational decision-making and outcomes. Few machine learning models have been developed to predict in-hospital death that are both broadly applicable to all adult patients across a health system and readily implementable, and, to the best of our knowledge, none have been implemented, evaluated prospectively, or externally validated. The primary objective of this study was to prospectively and externally validate a machine learning model that predicts in-hospital mortality for all adult patients at the time of hospital admission. Model performance was quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC). Secondary objectives were to design the model using commonly available EHR data and accessible computational methods. A total of 75,247 hospital admissions (median [IQR] age 59.5 [29.0] years; male [45.9%]) were included in the study. The in-hospital mortality rates for the training validation, retrospective validations at Hospitals A, B, and C, and prospective validation cohorts, respectively, were 3.0%, 2.7%, 1.8%, 2.1%, and 1.6%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs), respectively, were 0.87 (0.83-0.89), 0.85 (0.83-0.87), 0.89 (0.86-0.92), 0.84 (0.80-0.89), and 0.86 (0.83-0.90). The area under the precision recall curves (AUPRCs), respectively, were 0.29 (0.25-0.37), 0.17 (0.13-0.22), 0.22 (0.14-0.31), 0.13 (0.08-0.21), and 0.14 (0.09-0.21). The results demonstrated accurate prediction of in-hospital mortality for adult patients at the time of admission. The data elements, methods, and patient selection make the model implementable at a system-level.","Nathan Brajer; Brian Cozzi; Michael Gao; Mike Revoir; Marshall Nichols; Joseph Futoma; Jonathan Bae; Noppon Setji; Suresh Balu; Adrian Hernandez; Mark Sendak",20190625,"Health Systems And Quality Improvement","10.1101/19000133",1,"Nathan Brajer","Duke University School of Medicine","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000133v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000133v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"This study used electronic health record data from Duke University Health System.

14,"Gait differences in patients with multiple sclerosis who have low and high levels of disability.","Background: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) often results in gait impairment and disability. Objective: To investigate differences in spatiotemporal gait characteristics of people with MS who have low versus high levels of disability. Between trial and inter-limb consistency and the association of gait variables with level of disability were also investigated. Methods: Participants with MS who had either low-disability [n=7; 3 females; EDSS mean: 2.7{+/-}0.5, range 2.0-4.5; BMI=26.9{+/-}6.6] or high-disability [n=11; 6 females; EDSS mean: 2.7{+/-}0.5, range 6.0-6.5; BMI=27.8{+/-}1.5) performed 2 trials of self-selected walking on an instrumented walkway. Differences in group, limb, and group by limb interactions were assessed using analysis of variance, independent-measures t-tests, and Cohen's d effect sizes (ES). Between-trial consistency of gait were assessed with intra-class correlation coefficients (2, k). Results: Participants in the high disability group had increased step time (ES=0.8), cycle time (ES=0.8), and ambulation time (ES=1.2) while taking shorter strides (ES=0.9) and more steps at a slower rate (ES=1.1). The high disability group demonstrated less between-trial consistency for 69% of gait variables when compared to the low disability group. Conclusion: People with MS who have high levels of disability walk differently and with less consistency than those with lower levels of disability.

11,"Histopathologist Features Predictive of Diagnostic Concordance at Expert Level Amongst a Large International Sample of Pathologists Diagnosing Barrett's Dysplasia Using Digital Pathology","Objective: Guidelines recommend expert pathology review of Barrett's oesophagus (BO) biopsies that reveal dysplasia, but there are no evidence-based standards to corroborate expert reviewer status. We investigated BO concordance rates and pathologist features predictive of diagnostic discordance amongst a large international cohort of gastrointestinal pathologists to develop a quantitative model of BO expert review. Design: Pathologists (n=55) from over 20 countries assessed 55 digitised BO biopsies from across the diagnostic spectrum, before and after viewing matched p53 immunohistochemistry. Extensive demographic and clinical experience data were obtained via online questionnaire. We calculated discordance rates and applied multivariate regression analyses to identify predictors of concordance. Results: We recorded over 6,000 individual case diagnoses. Of 2,805 H&E diagnoses, we found excellent concordance (>70%) for non-dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus (NDBO) and high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and intermediate concordance for low-grade dysplasia (LGD, 42%) and indefinite for dysplasia (IND, 23%). Major diagnostic errors (i.e. NDBO overinterpreted as LGD/HGD or vice versa) were found in 248 diagnoses (8.8%), which reduced to 8.3% after viewing p53 labelled slides. At least 5 years of professional experience was protective against major diagnostic error for H&E slide review (OR 0.48, 95%CI 0.31-0.74). Working in a district general hospital was associated with increased odds of major diagnostic error (OR 1.76, 95%CI 1.15-2.69), however this was neutralised when pathologists viewed p53 labelled slides, suggesting a beneficial impact of p53 immunohistochemistry for this group. Conclusion: We have developed an evidence-based quantitative model of BO histopathology diagnosis at expert consensus level that will inform guideline development.","Myrtle J Van Der Wel; Helen G Coleman; Jacques Jghm Bergman; Marnix Jansen; Sybren L Meijer",20190625,"Oncology","10.1101/19000174",1,"Marnix Jansen","UCL Cancer Institute","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000174v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000174v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"All primary data will be made available upon request"
29,"Cost-Sensitive Machine Learning Classification for Mass Tuberculosis Screening","Active screening for Tuberculosis (TB) is needed to optimize detection and treatment. However, current algorithms for verbal screening perform poorly, causing misclassification that leads to missed cases and unnecessary and costly laboratory tests for false positives. We investigated the role of machine learning to improve the predefined one-size-fits-all algorithm used for scoring the verbal screening questionnaire. We present a cost-sensitive machine learning classification for mass tuberculosis screening. We compared score-based classification defined by clinicians to machine learning classification such as SVM-RBF, logistic regression, and XGBoost. We restricted our analyses to data from adults, the population most affected by TB, and investigated the difference between untuned and unweighted classifiers to the cost-sensitive ones. Predictions were compared with the corresponding GeneXpert MTB/Rif results. After adjusting the weight of the positive class to 40 for XGBoost, we achieved 96.64% sensitivity and 35.06% specificity. As such, sensitivity of our identifier increased by 1.26% while specificity increased by 13.19% in absolute value compared to the traditional score-based method defined by our clinicians. Our approach further demonstrated that only 2000 data points were sufficient to enable the model to converge. Our results indicate that even with limited data we can actually devise a better method to identify TB suspects from verbal screening. This approach may be a stepping stone towards more effective TB case identification, especially in primary health centres, and foster better detection and control of TB.","Septiandri, A.

101,"Optimising the use of molecular tools for the diagnosis of yaws","Introduction Yaws is a neglected tropical disease and results in lesions of skin, soft tissues and bones. PCR plays an important part in surveillance. Methods Children suspected to have yaws were enrolled. From the largest lesion paired swabs were collected; one into transport medium and one as a dry swab. In children with multiple lesions we collected additional swabs from up to four subsequent lesions. Swabs in transport medium were maintained in a cold-chain whilst dry swabs were stored at ambient temperature. Swabs were tested by PCR for Treponema pallidum and Haemophilus ducreyi. Results Of 55 individuals, 10 (18%) had at least 1 positive PCR for T. pallidum and 12 (22%) had at least 1 positive result for H. ducreyi. Concordance was 100% between swabs in transport medium and dry swabs. One patient had PCR-confirmed yaws on the swab of a third lesion when both the first and second lesions were PCR-negative. Discussion Storing swabs in transport medium and transporting in a cold chain did not improve yield, however detection of T. pallidum is increased by swabbing additional lesions. As the target for yaws is eradication approaches to sample collection need revisiting to ensure cases are not missed.","Munson, M.; Cresswell, B.; Kondobala, K.; Gainwu, B.; Lomotey, R.

497,"The prevalence of scabies, pyoderma and other communicable dermatoses in the Bijagos Archipelago, Guinea-Bissau","Background: Skin diseases represent a significant public health problem in most low and middle income settings. Nevertheless, there is a relative paucity of high-quality epidemiological data on the prevalence of these conditions. Materials/methods: We conducted two cross-sectional population-based skin-surveys of children (6 months to 9 years old) in the Bijagos Archipelago of Guinea-Bissau during the dry season (February-March 2018) and the wet season (June-July 2018). Following a period of training, a nurse performed a standardised examination for communicable dermatoses for each participant. We calculated the prevalence of each skin condition and investigated demographic associations. Results: 1062 children were enrolled in the dry season survey of whom 318 (29.9%) had at least one skin diseases. The most common diagnosis was tinea capitis (154/1062, 14.5% - 95% CI 12.5-16.8%) followed by tinea corporis (84/1062, 7.9% - 95% CI 6.4-9.7%), pyoderma (82/1062, 7.7% - 95% CI 6.2-9.5%) and scabies (56/1062. 5.2% - 95%CI 4.0 - 6.8%). 320 children were enrolled in the wet season survey of whom 121 (37.8%) had at least one skin problem. Tinea capitis remained the most common diagnosis (79/320, 24.7% - 95% CI 20.1 - 29.9%), followed by pyoderma (38/320, 11.9% - 95% CI 8.6-16.1%), tinea corporis (23/320, 7.2% - 95% 4.7 - 10.7%) and scabies (6/320, 1.9% - 95% CI 0.8-4.2%). Conclusions: Our study, which utilised robust population-based cluster random sampling methodology, demonstrates the substantial disease burden caused by common communicable dermatoses in this setting. Given these findings, there is a need to consider common dermatoses as part of Universal Health Coverage to deliver skin-health for all.","Marks, M.; Sammut, T.; Cabral, M. G.; Da Silva, E.

8,"Perception of whole-body motion during balance perturbations is impaired in Parkinson's disease and is associated with balance impairment","Background: In addition to motor deficits, Parkinson's disease (PD) may cause perceptual impairments. The role of perceptual impairments in sensorimotor function is unclear, and has typically been studied in single-joint motions. Research Question: We hypothesized that perception of whole-body motion is impaired in PD and contributes to balance impairments. We tested 1) whether directional acuity to whole body perturbations during standing was worse in people with PD compared to neurotypical older adults (NOA), and 2) whether balance ability, as assessed by the MiniBESTest, was associated with poor directional acuity in either group. Methods: Participants were exposed to pairs of support-surface translation perturbations in a two-alternative forced choice testing paradigm developed previously in a young healthy population. The first perturbation of each pair was directly backward and the second deviated to the left or right (1 degree-44 degrees). Participants judged and reported whether the perturbations in each pair were in the ""same"" or ""different"" direction. This information was used to calculate directional acuity thresholds corresponding to ""just-noticeable differences"" in perturbation direction. Linear mixed models determined associations between directional thresholds and clinical variables including MDS UPDRS-III score, age, and MiniBESTest score. Results: 20 PD (64+/-7 y, 12 male, >=12 hours since last intake of antiparkinsonian medications) and 12 NOA (64+/-8, 6 male) were assessed. Directional thresholds were higher (worse) among PD participants (17.6+/-5.9 degrees vs. 12.8+/-3.3 degrees, P<0.01). Linear mixed models further showed that higher thresholds were associated with MDS UPDRS-III score (P<0.01), and were associated with poorer balance ability among PD participants (P<0.01), but not among NOA participants (P=0.40). Significance: Perception of whole-body motion is impaired in PD and may contribute to impaired balance and falls.","Sistania M Bong; Jl Mckay; Stewart A Factor; Lena H Ting",20190625,"Neurology","10.1101/19000265",1,"Lena H Ting","Emory University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000265v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000265v1.full.pdf","cc_by","10.1016/j.gaitpost.2019.10.029","Data will be provided as supplemental information with the manuscript upon journal acceptance."
2,"Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis patient perspectives on clinical trials and participation","Background: Clinical trial recruitment is often the rate-limiting step in the development of new treatments reaching patients across all disease states. With more than 1500 currently available clinical trials for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) patients, it is important to understand patient perceptions of clinical trial participation to improve recruitment and retention. This study aimed to examine the specific challenges and barriers that might be reducing IBD patient enrollment and potential methods to overcome these barriers. Methods: Five in-person patient focus groups were conducted from February through May 2016 using two facilitation guides. Participants self-reported a diagnosis of Crohns disease or ulcerative colitis. Results: The five focus groups included a total of 34 participants. Participants discussed several barriers, including fears, disease severity at trial onset, potential adverse effects, time constraints, and the influence of both their primary IBD provider and support network. Methods to improve participation included better communication to prospective patients, reduced length of trial and time commitment, lower placebo rates, the option of open label extension, and support of the patient primary IBD provider. Conclusions: This is the first study to examine patient perceptions for IBD clinical trial enrollment, including barriers to participation and methods to improve participation. Fear and misunderstanding of clinical trials, engagement with providers, limiting time demands, and limiting the impact on work and family were found to be barriers to participation. Creative solutions to these problems could lead to greater participation in trials and more rapid advancement of new therapies to clinical approval and use.","Orna G Ehrlich; James Testaverde; Caren Heller; Stuart Daman; Annick Anderson; Peter D.r.

686,"LncRNA and predictive model for improving the diagnosis of clinically diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis","Background: Clinically diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients lack Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) microbiologic evidence, and misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis often occurs as a consequence. We investigated the potential of lncRNAs and corresponding predictive models to diagnose these patients. Methods: We enrolled 1372 subjects, including clinically diagnosed PTB patients, non-TB disease controls and healthy controls, in three cohorts (Screening, Selection and Validation). Candidate lncRNAs differentially expressed in blood samples of the PTB and healthy control groups were identified by microarray and qRT-PCR in the Screening Cohort. Logistic regression models were developed using lncRNAs and/or electronic health records (EHRs) from clinically diagnosed PTB patients and non-TB disease controls in the Selection Cohort. These models were evaluated by AUC and decision curve analysis, and the optimal model was presented as a Web-based nomogram, which was evaluated in the Validation Cohort. The biological function of lncRNAs was interrogated using ELISA, lactate dehydrogenase release analysis and flow cytometry. Results: Three differentially expressed lncRNAs (ENST00000497872, n333737, n335265) were identified. The optimal model (i.e., nomogram) incorporated these three lncRNAs and six EHR variables (age, hemoglobin, weight loss, low-grade fever, CT calcification and TB-IGRA). The nomogram showed an AUC of 0.89, sensitivity of 0.86 and specificity of 0.82 in the Validation Cohort, which demonstrated better discrimination and clinical net benefit than the EHR model. ENST00000497872 may regulate inflammatory cytokine production, cell death and apoptosis during MTB infection. Conclusion: LncRNAs and the user-friendly nomogram could facilitate the early identification of PTB cases among suspected patients with negative MTB microbiologic evidence.","Hu, X.; Chen, H.; Liao, S.; Bai, H.; Gupta, S.; Zhou, Y.; Zhou, J.; Jiao, L.; Wu, L.; Wang, M.; Chen, X.; Zhou, Y.; Lu, X.; Hu, T.

408,"Framework for rational donor selection in fecal microbiota transplant clinical trials","Early clinical successes are driving enthusiasm for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), the transfer of healthy gut bacteria through whole stool, as emerging research is linking the microbiome to many different diseases. However, preliminary trials have yielded mixed results and suggest that heterogeneity in donor stool may play a role in patient response. Thus, clinical trials may fail because an ineffective donor was chosen rather than because FMT is not appropriate for the indication. Here, we describe a conceptual framework to guide rational donor selection to increase the likelihood that FMT clinical trials will succeed. We argue that the mechanism by which the microbiome is hypothesized to be associated with a given indication should inform how healthy donors are selected for FMT trials, categorizing these mechanisms into four disease models and presenting associated donor selection strategies. We next walk through examples based on previously published FMT trials and ongoing investigations to illustrate how donor selection might occur in practice. Finally, we show that typical FMT trials are not powered to discover individual taxa mediating patient responses, suggesting that clinicians should develop targeted hypotheses for retrospective analyses and design their clinical trials accordingly. Moving forward, developing and applying novel clinical trial design methodologies like rational donor selection will be necessary to ensure that FMT successfully translates into clinical impact.","Duvallet, C.; Zellmer, C.; Panchal, P.; Budree, S.; Osman, M.; Alm, E.",20190926,"Gastroenterology","10.1101/19000307",2,"Eric Alm","Massachusetts Institute of Technology","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000307v2?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000307v2.full.pdf","cc_by","10.1371/journal.pone.0222881","Code to reproduce all of these analyses and figures can be found at https://github.com/cduvallet/donor-selection/.

15,"Metabolomics in juvenile-onset SLE: identifying new biomarkers to predict cardiovascular risk","BACKGROUND: Juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE) is an autoimmune disorder characterised by immune dysregulation, chronic inflammation and increased cardiovascular risk (CVR). Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in JSLE patients not attributable to disease flares. However, it is not possible to predict those patients at greatest risk using traditional CVR factors. METHODSerum metabolomic analysis was performed using a nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-platform in 31 JSLE patients. Data was analysed using cluster, linear regression and receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results were validated in a second cohort of 31 JSLE patients and using data from a cohort of adult-onset SLE patients with known pre-clinical atherosclerotic plaque. RESULTS: Unbiased hierarchical clustering of metabolomic data identified three patient groups. Group-1 had decreased atheroprotective high density lipoproteins (HDL) and increased atherogenic very low and low density lipoproteins (VLDL/LDL); Group-2 had elevated HDL but reduced VLDL/LDL; and Group-3 had low HDL/VLDL/LDL levels. Notably, apolipoprotein(Apo)B1:ApoA1 ratio, a known CVR marker in adult cohorts, was elevated in Group-1 JSLE patients compared to Groups-2/3. The metabolomic signature was validated in a second JSLE cohort and compared with lipid biomarkers previously associated with pre-clinical atherosclerotic plaque in adult SLE patients. Linear regression analysis accounting for demographics, treatment, disease activity, lupus serological markers and body mass index confirmed that a unique metabolomic profile could differentiate between JSLE patients at high and low CVR. CONCLUSIONS: Patient stratification using ApoB:ApoA1 ratio and lipoprotein signatures could facilitate tailored lipid modification therapies and/or diet/lifestyle interventions to combat increased CVR in JSLE.","George A Robinson; Leda Coelewij; Ania Radziszewska; Chris Wincup; Hannah Peckham; Kirsty Waddington; David A Isenberg; Yiannis Ioannou; Coziana Ciurtin; Ines Pineda-Torra; Elizabeth C Jury",20190625,"Rheumatology","10.1101/19000356",1,"Elizabeth C Jury","University College London","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000356v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000356v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"Metabolomic and logistic regression data is listed in the supplemental data."

To help understand the changes to services and policies that are required to deliver better care, we used a novel approach to investigate which diseases co-occur and how combinations are associated with mortality and service use. Methods Linked primary and secondary care electronic health records contributed by 382 general practices in England to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) were used. The study included a representative set of multimorbid adults (18 years old or more) with two or more long-term conditions (N=113,211). A random set of 80% of the multimorbid patients (N=90,571) were stratified by age and clustered using latent class analysis. Consistency between obtained disease profiles, classification quality and associations with demographic characteristics and primary outcomes (hospitalisation, polypharmacy and mortality) was validated in the remaining 20% of multimorbid patients (N=22,640). Findings We identified twenty patient clusters across four age strata. The clusters with the highest mortality comprised psychoactive substance and alcohol misuse (aged 18-64), coronary heart disease, depression and pain (aged 65-84) and coronary heart disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation (aged 85+). The clusters with the highest service use coincided with those with highest mortality for people aged over 65. For people aged 18-64, the cluster with the highest service use comprised depression, anxiety and pain. The majority of 85+ year olds multimorbid patients belonged to the cluster with the lowest service use and mortality for that age range. Pain featured in thirteen clusters. Interpretation This work has highlighted patterns of multimorbidity that have implications for health services. These include the importance of psychoactive substance and alcohol misuse in people under the age of 65; of co-morbid depression and coronary heart disease in people aged 65-84, and of cardiovascular disease in people aged 85+.","Zhu, Y.; Edwards, D.; Mant, J.; Payne, R.

4,"Predicting epileptic seizures using nonnegative matrix factorization","This paper presents a procedure for the patient-specific prediction of epileptic seizures. To this end, a combination of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and smooth basis functions with robust regression is applied to power spectra of intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) signals. The resulting time and frequency components capture the dominant information from power spectra, while removing outliers and noise. This makes it possible to detect structure in preictal states, which is used for classification. Linear support vector machines (SVM) with L1 regularization are used to select and weigh the contributions from different number of not equally informative channels among patients. Due to class imbalance in data, synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) is applied. The resulting method yields a computationally and conceptually simple, interpretable model of EEG signals of preictal and interictal states, which shows a good performance for the task of seizure prediction.","Olivera Stojanovic; Gordon Pipa",20190625,"Health Informatics","10.1101/19000430",1,"Olivera Stojanovic","Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Osnabrueck","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000430v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000430v1.full.pdf","cc_by","10.1371/journal.pone.0228025","The data used in this project is a part of the EPILEPSIAE dataset, which is not publicly available.

3,"Updating Insights into Rosiglitazone and Cardiovascular Risk through Shared Data: Individual Patient-and-Summary-Level Meta-Analyses","Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of rosiglitazone therapy on cardiovascular risk and mortality using multiple data sources and varying analytical approaches. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Data sources: GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) Clinical Study Data Request (CSDR) and Study Register platforms, MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to January 2019. Study selection criteria: Randomized, controlled, phase II-IV clinical trials comparing rosiglitazone with any control for at least 24 weeks in adults. Data extraction and synthesis: For analyses of trials for which individual patient-level data (IPD) were available, we examined a composite of the following events as our primary outcome: acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiovascular-related deaths, and non-cardiovascular-related deaths. As secondary analyses, these four events were examined independently. When also including trials for which IPD were not available, we examined myocardial infarction and cardiovascular-related deaths, ascertained from summary-level data. Multiple meta-analyses were conducted, accounting for trials with zero events in one or all arms with two different continuity corrections (i.e., 0.5 constant and treatment arm comparator continuity correction), to calculate odds ratios and risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Results: There were 33 eligible trials for which IPD were available (21156 participants) through GSK's CSDR. We also identified 103 additional trials for which IPD were not available from which we ascertained myocardial infarctions (23683 patients) and 103 trials for cardiovascular-related deaths (22772 patients). Among trials for which IPD were available, we identified a greater number of myocardial infarctions and fewer cardiovascular-related deaths reported in the IPD as compared to the summary-level data. When limited to trials for which IPD were available and accounting for trials with zero-events in only one arm using a constant continuity correction of 0.5, patients treated with rosiglitazone had a 39% increased risk of a composite event compared with controls (Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio 1.39, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.68). When examined separately, the odds ratios for myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiovascular-related death, and non-cardiovascular-related death were 1.25 (0.99 to 1.60), 1.60 (1.20 to 2.14), 1.18 (0.64 to 2.17), and 1.13 (0.58 to 2.20), respectively. When all trials for which IPD were and were not available were combined for myocardial infarction and cardiovascular-related deaths, the odds ratios were attenuated (1.13 (0.92 to 1.38) and 1.10 (0.73 to 1.65), respectively). Effect estimates and 95% confidence intervals were broadly consistent when analyses were repeated including trials with zero events across all arms using constant continuity corrections of 0.5 or treatment arm continuity corrections. Conclusions: Results of this comprehensive meta-analysis aggregating a multitude of trials and analyzed using a variety of statistical techniques suggest that rosiglitazone is consistently associated with an increased cardiovascular risk, likely driven by heart failure events, whose interpretation is complicated by varying magnitudes of myocardial infarction risk that were attenuated through aggregation of summary-level data in addition to IPD.","Joshua D Wallach; Kun Wang; Audrey D Zhang; Deanna Chang; Holly K Grossetta Nardini; Haiqun Lin; Michael B Bracken; Mayur Desai; Harlan Krumholz; Joseph S.

49,"Misclassification of a whole genome sequence reference defined by the Human Microbiome Project: a detrimental carryover effect to microbiome studies","Taxonomic classification is an essential step in the analysis of microbiome data that depends on a reference database of whole genome sequences. Taxonomic classifiers are built on established reference species, such as the Human Microbiome Project database, that is growing rapidly. While constructing a population wide pangenome of the bacterium Hungatella, we discovered that the Human Microbiome Project reference species Hungatella hathewayi (WAL 18680) was significantly different to other members of this genus. Specifically, the reference lacked the core genome as compared to the other members. Further analysis, using average nucleotide identity (ANI) and 16s rRNA comparisons, indicated that WAL18680 was misclassified as Hungatella. The error in classification is being amplified in the taxonomic classifiers and will have a compounding effect as microbiome analyses are done, resulting in inaccurate assignment of community members and will lead to fallacious conclusions and possibly treatment. As automated genome homology assessment expands for microbiome analysis, outbreak detection, and public health reliance on whole genomes increases this issue will likely occur at an increasing rate. These observations highlight the need for developing reference free methods for epidemiological investigation using whole genome sequences and the criticality of accurate reference databases.","Bandoy, D.

54,"Proximal and distal factors predicting timely initiation of breastfeeding in Ethiopia: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: In Ethiopia, the current coverage of timely initiation of breast feeding (TIBF) has fallen short of the National Health Sector Transformation Plan 2016-2020, National Nutrition Program 2016-2020 and WHO global target. This calls for the need to assess relevant proximal and distal factors that affect the rate of TIBF in Ethiopia. Objective: The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the association between TIBF and educational status, household income, marital status, media exposure, and parity in Ethiopia. Methods: Databases used were PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, SCOPUS, CINAHL and WHO Global health library, and key terms were searched using interactive searching syntax. It was also supplemented by manual searching. Observational studies published between September 2000 and March 2019 were included. The methodological quality of studies was examined using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cross-sectional studies. Data were extracted using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) data extraction tool. To obtain the pooled odds ratio (OR), extracted data were fitted in a random-effects meta-analysis model. Statistical heterogeneity was quantified using Cochran Q test, tau2, and I2 statistics. Additional analysis conducted includes Jackknife sensitivity analysis, cumulative meta-analysis, and meta-regression analysis. Results: Out of 553 studies retrieved, 25 studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Almost all studies were conducted on mothers with newborn less than 23 months. Maternal educational status (OR = 1.82; p < 0.001; 95% CI = 1.35 - 2.45; I2 = 84.96%), paternal educational status (OR = 2.72; p = 0.001, 95% CI = 1.49 - 4.97 I2 = 62.50%), income (OR = 1.16; p = 0.002; 95% CI = 1.05 - 1.27; I2 = 0.00%), marital status (OR = 1.39; p = 0.001; 95% CI = 1.14 - 1.69; I2 = 9.17%) and parity (OR = 1.39; p = 0.01; 95% CI = 1.07 - 1.81; I2 = 74.43%) were found to be significantly associated with TIBF. We also observed a direct dose-response relationship of TIBF with educational status and income. Conclusions: Proximal and distal factors significantly predicting TIBF practice in Ethiopia, which needs integrated intervention by health professionals and healthcare policymakers. Health education, counselling and peer education targeting parents at antenatal and postnatal periods are needed. It is also relevant to improve the economic power of women and promote gender equality.","Habtewold, T. D.; Mohammed, S. H.; Endalamaw, A.; Mulugeta, H.; Dessie, G.; Berhe, D. F.; Birhanu, M.

152,"Microbiota and Health Study: a prospective cohort of respiratory and diarrheal infections and associated risk factors in Bangladeshi infants under two years","Background: Early childhood respiratory and diarrheal infections are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. There is a need to further assess the epidemiology through prospective and community-based studies to gain key insights that could inform preventative measures to reduce the risk of infectious disease in this vulnerable population. We aimed to analyze the burden and determinants of acute respiratory infection (ARI) and diarrhea episodes affecting infants during their first 2 years of life with state-of-the-art molecular technologies. Methods: The ARI and diarrhea episodes were prospectively collected in a community-based, longitudinal cohort of infants (n=267) from birth to 2 years of life in Bangladesh. Women were recruited during the third trimester of pregnancy. Demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental information on the households was recorded. Nasopharyngeal and fecal samples were collected during regular scheduled visits from mother-infant pairs, and also from the infants during unscheduled visits for reported illnesses. New generation sequencing methods will be utilized to determine microbiota composition and function, supplemented by the state-of-the-art multiplex molecular detection technology for a wide range of bacterial and viral pathogens. Discussion: This study sought to assess the epidemiology of both respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses during the first 2 years of life in children from a peri-urban community of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Characteristics of the mothers, as well as birth characteristics of infants enrolled in the Microbiota and Health Study are presented here. We will determine any potential association between microbiota composition and the abovementioned illnesses, and also examine the influence of known and hypothesized risk factors on the occurrence of infections. Such putative factors include environmental, socioeconomic, maternal, clinical, and selected genetic factors, namely the variation of the fucosyltransferase genes (FUT2 and FUT3) of mothers and infants. This study will add to current knowledge about these early childhood infectious diseases, and will provide data to generate hypotheses for the development of nutritional approaches to be used as prevention strategies. Trial registration: The study was retrospectively registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02361164 (February 11, 2015).","Vidal, K.; Sultana, S.; Prieto Patron, A.; Binia, A.; Rahman, M.; Deeba, I.

22,"Association of puberty timing with Type 2 diabetes: Systematic review and meta-analysis","OBJECTIVE: We aimed to systematically review published evidence on the association between puberty timing and Type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance (T2D/IGT), with and without adjustment for adiposity, and to estimate its potential contribution to the burden of T2D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, Medline and Embase databases for publications until February 2019 on the timing of any secondary sexual characteristic in boys or girls in relation to T2D/IGT. Inverse-weighted random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool reported estimates and meta-regression to explore sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Twenty eight observational studies were identified. All assessed age at menarche (AAM) in women (combined N=1,228,306); only one study additionally included men. In models without adjustment for adult adiposity, T2D/IGT risk was higher per year earlier AAM (relative risk (RR)=0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.89-0.93, 11 estimates, n=833,529, I2=85.4%) and for early versus later menarche (RR=1.41, 95% CI=1.28-1.55, 23 estimates, n=1,185,444, I2=87.8%). Associations were weaker but still evident in models adjusted for adiposity (AAM: RR=0.97 per year, 95% CI=0.95-0.98, 12 estimates, n=852,268, I2=51.8%; early menarche: RR=1.19, 95% CI=1.11-1.28, 21 estimates, n=890,583, I2=68.1%). Associations were stronger among Caucasians than Asians, and in populations with earlier average AAM. The estimated population attributable risk of T2D in UK Caucasians due to early menarche, unadjusted and adjusted for adiposity, was 12.6% (95% CI=11.0-14.3) and 5.1% (95% CI=3.6-6.7), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of T2D in women is attributable to early menarche timing. This will increase in light of global secular trends towards earlier puberty timing.","Tuck Seng Cheng; Felix R. Day; Rajalakshmi Lakshman; Ken K.

130,"Show solidarity with the Congolese people in the 10th Ebola outbreak declared a health emergency of international concern: understand a qualitative study of variables of hospital activities on infection control practices in Kinshasa city","Health workers play an important role during epidemics, but there is limited research on hospital activities on infection control practices in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and how health workers can cope during a probable health epidemic in Kinshasa city. The determinants of the current Ebola Virus Disease in the geographical distribution remain poorly understood. The World Health Organization's Health Regulation Committee decided on Wednesday July 17th, 2019 to declare the Ebola haemorrhagic fever epidemic in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri as a health emergency of international concern. The country struggles to control it against a backdrop of a health system that is already overburdened. To test the influence of the challenges of a contamination in the context of an Ebola outbreak that may face health workers and their coping strategies in thirteen hospitals of reference in Kinshasa, we conducted a survey hoping to educate or remember good practices for health workers in Kinshasa that is also available for health workers in the East Area of the country in which the ongoing Ebola outbreak progress is spreading (North Kivu and Ituri). For the ongoing outbreak, we obtained data from the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo where cases are classified as suspected, probable, or confirmed using national case definitions. We found that the ongoing Ebola virus outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has similar epidemiological features to previous Ebola virus disease outbreak in Sierra Leone that was well described. For the qualitative study about the biosecurity in thirteen hospitals of reference in Kinshasa, we found that the Bondeko-Ngaliema Monkole group has occupied the first rank, while the group Kintambo-King Baudouin-Ndjili-Makala occupied the other end of the scale; the other health facilities occupied an intermediate position. Among the 7 hospitals which were placed at the top of this classification of biosecurity, 5 were massively subsidized by international NGO, which explains to a great extent their performances in one hand, another hand finding its explanation in the quality of their management.

We evaluated GISTelemed accordingly to the guidelines published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and input provided by a questionnaire customized according to AdEQUATE (questionnAire for Evaluation of QUAlity in TElemedicine systems). 39 healthcare professionals from 13 municipalities participated in the evaluation. We analyzed data from questionnaires using descriptive statistics, being Lernability and Comfort the characteristics that received the best evaluation. Quantitative evaluation based upon leprosis cases detected through tele-dermatology showed a sensitivity and PPV of respectively 77.2% and 95.3%. 22.8% of the cases detected were un-notified cases. Results from our case study show a good evaluation regarding the perceived software quality. We conclude that the integration of spatial epidemiology tools to the STT/SC system, besides enabling visualization of data in maps, allowed users to analyze the evolution of morbidities and their co-occurrences.","Von Wangenheim, A.; Savaris, A.; Borgatto, A.

7,"18F-AV1451 PET imaging and white matter changes in progressive supranuclear palsy","Introduction: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is characterized by deposition of straight filament tau aggregates in the grey matter of deep nuclei and cerebellum. White matter changes are increasingly documented as a feature of degenerative parkinsonism. We therefore examined the relationship between tau pathology (assessed via 18F-AV1451 positron emission tomography) and white matter integrity (using diffusion tensor imaging, DTI) in PSP. Methods: Twenty-three people with clinically probable PSP-Richardson's syndrome (age 68.8 +/- 5.8 years, 39% female) and 23 controls underwent structural 3T brain MRI including DTI. Twenty-one patients also underwent 18F-AV145 PET imaging. DTI group comparisons were performed using Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Mean Diffusivity (MD) and Radial Diffusivity (RD). Voxel-wise white matter integrity was correlated with 18F-AV1451 binding in typical subcortical PSP regions of interest (i.e. putamen, pallidum, thalamus and midbrain). DTI and 18F-AV1451 imaging measures were correlated with clinical impairment. Results: Widespread DTI changes in PSP subjects relative to controls (family-wise error FWE p<0.01) were observed. In PSP, higher 18F-AV1451 binding correlated with reduced white matter integrity in the bilateral internal capsule, corona radiata, and superior longitudinal fasciculus (FWE p<0.05). Association between cognitive impairment (ACER score) and white matter deficits were found in the genu of corpus callosum and cingulum (p<0.005). Conclusion: This cross-sectional study demonstrates an association between in vivo proxy measures of tau pathology and white matter degeneration in PSP. Longitudinal studies and more specific PET probes for non-Alzheimer tauopathies are warranted to assess the complex interplay between microstructural changes and protein deposition in PSP.","Nicolas Nicastro; Patricia Vazquez Rodriguez; Maura Malpetti; W.

10,"Transfer of Statistical Innovations of the 1990s-2000s in Oncology to the Biomedical Literature","Introduction: Innovations in the fields of clinical studies require time to generate and disseminate new knowledge. We aimed to specifically explore lag times between the introduction and widespread use of innovative statistical methods in oncology using the competing risks and phase I model-based clinical trials settings as examples. Methods: First, we defined a set of closed articles for each setting based on two princeps papers (Gray, Annals of Statistics 1998 for the competing risks setting and O Quigley et al., Biometrics 1990 for the phase I setting). Secondly, we retrieved from the web of science all citations of the papers included in these sets. Each journal was classified as applied, semi-applied or methodological. Results: A total of 6,727 citations for the competing risks setting and 2,639 citations for the phase I setting were found. Time to reach 25 citations was 6.2 years for the paper from Gray and 4.5 years for the Fine and Gray paper, while it ranged from 3.4 years up to at least 20.1 years and not reached for 6 papers from the competing risks setting. The vast majority (91%) of the citing papers for the competing risks setting originated from applied journals. In contrast, less than half (44%) of the citing papers for the phase I setting were published in applied journals. Conclusion: Statistical innovations in the competing risks setting have been widely diffused in the medical literature unlike the model-based designs for phase I trials, which are still seldom used 30 years after publication.","Alexandre Vivot; Vincent Levy; Sylvie Chevret",20190625,"Oncology","10.1101/19000638",1,"Alexandre Vivot","APHP","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000638v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000638v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"Data used in this study are publicly available data.

28,"Big Five Personality Traits Influence Tinnitus Improvement Over Time","Previous studies investigating the relation between personality and tinnitus distress showed that high neuroticism and low extraversion scores are related to higher tinnitus distress measured by the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) and the Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ). However, little is known about the role of personality on tinnitus distress over time. We collected the THI, TQ and Big Five Factor Index 2 of 388 patients who visited the Tinnitus Center Regensburg between 2012 and 2017, and filled in a survey with the same questionnaires in 2018. We used personality traits and facets to predict tinnitus distress cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Neuroticism and extraversion were significant predictors of THI and TQ scores in cross-sectional linear regression setups, and could explain up to 40% of the variance. However, the linear regressions could explain only little variance of both THI and TQ longitudinally. We clustered patients in three groups based in the difference THI and TQ between the two assessments: clinically improved, clinically stable and clinically worsened. The patients in the clinically improved and clinically stable groups scored statistically significantly lower in neuroticism and higher in extraversion than patients in the group clinically worsened. We observed a similar trend among patients who tried at least one clinical treatment. Our results suggest that personality traits, namely neuroticism and extraversion, are relevant markers of tinnitus distress over time and could be used to statistically distinguish patient groups with clinically relevant changes of tinnitus distress. These markers could inform both treatment responses from clinical studies and future choices on more efficient individual tinnitus treatments.","Simoes, J.

12,"Pain Reduction by Inducing Sensory-Motor Adaptation in Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS PRISMA): Protocol for a Double-blind Randomized Controlled Trial","Background: Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) presents as chronic, continuous pain and sensory, autonomic, and motor abnormalities affecting one or more extremities. People with CRPS can also show changes in their perception of and attention to the affected body part and sensory information in the affected side of space. Prism Adaptation (PA) is a behavioural intervention targeted at reducing attention deficits in post-stroke hemispatial neglect. PA also appears to reduce pain and other CRPS symptoms; however, these therapeutic effects have been demonstrated only in small unblinded studies. This paper describes the protocol for an ongoing double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial that will evaluate the efficacy of PA treatment for CRPS. The secondary aims of the study are to examine the relationships between neuropsychological changes (such as spatial attention, space and body representation, and motor spatial performance) and clinical manifestations of CRPS, as well as symptom improvement. Methods: Forty-two participants with upper-limb CRPS type I will undergo two weeks of twice-daily PA treatment or sham treatment. The primary outcome measures are current pain intensity and CRPS severity score, measured immediately before and after the treatment period. Secondary outcome measures include the results of self-report questionnaires about pain, movement, symptoms interference, and body representation; clinical assessments of sensory, motor, and autonomic functions; and computer-based psychophysical tests of neuropsychological functions. Data are collected in four research visits: four weeks and one day before treatment, and one day and four weeks after the end of treatment. Additional follow-up through postal questionnaires is conducted three and six months post-treatment. Discussion: It is hypothesised that participants undergoing PA treatment, compared to those receiving sham treatment, will show greater reduction in pain and CRPS severity score, and improvements on other clinical and neuropsychological measures. Also, more pronounced neuropsychological symptoms are predicted to correlate with more severe clinical CRPS symptoms. This study will provide the first randomized double-blind evaluation of the therapeutic effects of PA that could be implemented as a rehabilitation method for CRPS, and will contribute to the understanding of how neuropsychological changes in body representation and attention pertain to the manifestation and treatment of CRPS.","Monika Halicka; Axel D Vitters; Michael J Proulx; Janet H Bultitude",20190625,"Pain Medicine","10.1101/19000653",1,"Monika Halicka","University of Bath","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000653v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000653v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd","10.1186/s12883-020-1604-z","There is no data associated with the current paper, which describes a protocol for a clinical trial that is in progress at the time of submission.

21,"Comparative analysis of functional assay evidence use by ClinGen Variant Curation Expert Panels","Background The 2015 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) guidelines for clinical sequence variant interpretation state that well-established functional studies can be used as evidence in variant classification. These guidelines articulated key attributes of functional data, including that assays should reflect the biological environment and be analytically sound; however, details of how to evaluate these attributes were left to expert judgment. The Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) designates Variant Curation Expert Panels (VCEPs) in specific disease areas to make gene-centric specifications to the ACMG/AMP guidelines, including more specific definitions of appropriate functional assays. We set out to evaluate the existing VCEP guidelines for functional assays. Methods We evaluated the functional criteria (PS3/BS3) of six VCEPs (CDH1, Hearing Loss, Inherited Cardiomyopathy-MYH7, PAH, PTEN, RASopathy). We then established criteria for evaluating functional studies based on disease mechanism, general class of assay, and the characteristics of specific assay instances described in primary literature. Using these criteria, we extensively curated assay instances cited by each VCEP in their pilot variant classification to analyze VCEP recommendations and their use in the interpretation of functional studies. Results Unsurprisingly, our analysis highlighted the breadth of VCEP-approved assays, reflecting the diversity of disease mechanisms among VCEPs. We also noted substantial variability between VCEPs in the method used to select these assays and in the approach used to specify strength modifications, as well as differences in suggested validation parameters. Importantly, we observed discrepancies between the parameters VCEPs specified as required for approved assay instances and the fulfillment of these requirements in the individual assays cited in pilot variant interpretation. Conclusions Interpretation of the intricacies of functional assays often requires expert-level knowledge of the gene and disease and current VCEP recommendations for functional assay evidence are a useful tool to improve the accessibility of functional data. However, our analysis suggests that further guidance is needed to standardize this process and ensure consistency in the application of functional evidence.","Dona M. Kanavy; Shannon M.

16,"Electrocardiographic Changes After Completion of a Triathlon","Objectives: Given the increasing popularity of long-distance triathlon events amongst amateur athlete and the difficulty for emergency physician to address cardiovascular complaints in the context of exercise, this study aims to: -Identify the prevalence of electrocardiographic abnormalities before and after a long distance triathlon in a cohort of participants using the Seattle criteria. -Identify the acute changes that occur on their ECGs at the finish line of a long-distance triathlon. Methods: This prospective observational study examines the prevalence of selected standard 12-lead ECG findings, the Seattle criteria, in asymptomatic athletes before and after the completion of a long-distance triathlon. Results: Of 99 ECGs obtained prior to the race, 28 were abnormal, for a pre-race prevalence of 28.3% (95% CI (20.4, 37.8)). Of the 72 ECGs post-race, 12 were abnormal, for a post-race prevalence of 16.7% (95% CI (9.8, 26.9)). We did not observe any athletes with marked repolarization abnormalities. Common findings were increased QRS voltage significant for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (24 (24.2%) pre-race, 10 (14.1%) post-race), early repolarization (21 (21.2%) pre-race, 19 (26.8%) post-race) and incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB) (8 (8.1%) pre-race, 11 (15.5%) post-race). McNemar test showed no agreement between the ECG pre and post results (Chi-square =6.54, p = 0.01), suggesting a possible effect of the race on ECG findings. We observed a trend to normalization of athletes ECGs with acute exercise. Conclusion: Long-distance endurance exercise might acutely affect the ECGs findings in asymptomatic athletes and abnormal ECG findings were common in our cohort of athletes. Physicians providing care to long-distance athletes should interpret ECGs in this population prudently.","Caroline Hosatte-Ducassy; Jose Correa; Francois Lalonde; Rohit Mohindra; Michael Chetrit; Gregory Marton; Audrey Marcotte; Francois Tournoux; Eileen Bridges",20190625,"Sports Medicine","10.1101/19000687",1,"Caroline Hosatte-Ducassy","McGill University, Department of Emergency Medicine","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000687v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000687v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd","10.1002/tsm2.134","Deanonymized datas available upon request."
35,"Robotic middle ear access for cochlear implantation: first in man","To demonstrate the feasibility of robotic middle ear access in a clinical setting, nine adult patients with severe-to-profound hearing loss indicated for cochlear implantation were included in this clinical trial. A keyhole access tunnel to the tympanic cavity and targeting the round window was planned based on preoperatively acquired computed tomography image data and robotically drilled to the level of the facial recess. Intraoperative imaging was performed to confirm sufficient distance of the drilling trajectory to relevant anatomy. Robotic drilling continued toward the round window. The cochlear access was manually created by the surgeon. Electrode arrays were inserted through the keyhole tunnel under microscopic supervision via a tympanomeatal flap. All patients were successfully implanted with a cochlear implant. In 9 of 9 patients the robotic drilling was planned and performed to the level of the facial recess. In 3 patients, the procedure was reverted to a conventional approach for safety reasons. No change in facial nerve function compared to baseline measurements was observed. Robotic keyhole access for cochlear implantation is feasible. Further improvements to workflow complexity, duration of surgery, and usability including safety assessments are required to enable wider adoption of the procedure.","Caversaccio, M.; Wimmer, W.; Anso, J.; Mantokoudis, G.; Gerber, N.; Rathgeb, C.; Schneider, D.; Hermann, J.; Wagner, F.; Scheidegger, O.; Huth, M.; Anschuetz, L.; Kompis, M.; Williamson, T.; Bell, B.; Gavaghan, K.; Weber, S.",20190703,"Otolaryngology","10.1101/19000711",1,"Wilhelm Wimmer","Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000711v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000711v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd","10.1371/journal.pone.0220543","All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files."
63,"Reduced survival in COPD patients who received long-term oxygen therapy without meeting prescription criteria: a preliminary study","Background: Randomized clinical trials have provided clear evidence that long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) increases life expectancy in severely hypoxemic COPD patients. However, in real-life settings, in global COPD cohorts, a paradoxical 2-3-fold increased risk of death has been reported in patients under LTOT. This discrepancy could be explained by a subgroup of patients under LTOT who do not meet the current guidelines and for whom LTOT would be associated with poor prognosis. This retrospective study of a global COPD cohort therefore sought to: (1) determine if a subgroup of patients under LTOT without severe hypoxemia could be distinguished, and (2) compare the mortality risk according to hypoxemia severity and LTOT prescription. Method: The sample was taken from a database (NCT02055885) on 191 stable COPD patients (age: 65.1{+/-}9.8 years, 85 women) admitted for a pulmonary rehabilitation program between 2009 and 2012 and followed until 1 January 2018. Uni- and multivariate Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) models were used to examine the associations between clinical characteristics (age, sex, blood gases, etc.), LTOT according to PaO2 level, and mortality. Results: Forty patients (21%) were under LTOT at PR entry despite not meeting the O2 prescription criteria. Patients under LTOT had a nearly 2-fold higher mortality risk adjusted by covariates (HRmultivariate=1.83; p=0.009). Furthermore, the higher mortality risk under LTOT was specific to the patients under LTOT without severe hypoxemia (HRmultivariate=2.39; p=0.04). Conclusion: The association between LTOT and mortality might be attributed to a subgroup under LTOT despite not/no longer meeting the LTOT criteria. Further studies are needed to identify the physiological basis of this phenomenon.","Alexandre, F.; Varray, A.; Stephan, Y.; Hayot, M.; Heraud, N.",20190708,"Respiratory Medicine","10.1101/19000760",1,"Francois Alexandre","Les Cliniques du Souffle, groupe 5-Sante","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000760v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000760v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nd",NA,"The data are fully available on request to comitederecherche@5-sante.fr"
20,"Nutritional Supplementation during Pulmonary Rehabilitation in COPD: A Systematic Review","Uptake of nutritional supplementation during pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been limited by an absence of rigorous evidence-based studies supporting use. Our objective were to report and summarise the current evidence supporting use of nutritional supplementation to improve outcomes during pulmonary rehabilitation in stable COPD patients. A systematic search was conducted up to May 7th, 2019 (registration number CRD42018089142). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used. Six databases were included: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online or MEDLARS Online (Medline), Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Excerpta Medica dataBASE (Embase), Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Web of Science. This systematic search generated 580 initial matches, of which 24 studies (1035 COPD participants) met the pre-specified criteria and were included. Our analysis does not confirm an impact of nutritional supplementation during PR, but studies, supplements and PR programmes were heterogeneous in nature. There is currently insufficient evidence on the effect of nutritional supplementation on improving outcomes during PR in patients with COPD. Therefore, controversy remains and further research is needed.","Abdulelah Aldhahir; John Hurst; Swapna Mandal; Ahmed Alrajeh; Yousef Aldabayan; Jaber Alqahtani; Salifu Drammeh; Vanitha Subbu",20190628,"Nutrition","10.1101/19000786",1,"Abdulelah Aldhahir","University College London","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000786v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000786v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd","10.1177/1479973120904953","Not applicable"
588,"Association Between Blood Circulating Vitamin D and Colorectal Cancer Risk in Asian Countries: A Systematic Review and Dose-Response Meta-analysis","Objectives: We conducted this dose-response meta-analysis to assess the association between blood circulating Vitamin D levels and colorectal cancer risk in Asian population. Design: This study was a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis for observational studies which investigated the relationship between blood circulating Vitamin D levels and colorectal cancer risk in Asian population. Data Sources: Relevant studies were identified by searching literature in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science until 31 January 2019. Eligibility criteria: original studies published in peer-reviewed journals investigating association between blood circulating Vitamin D levels and the risk of colorectal cancer and/or adenoma in Asian countries. Data extraction and synthesis: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of included studies. Study-specific ORs were pooled using a random-effects model. A dose-response meta-analysis was performed with generalized least squares regression. We applied the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) quality assessment tool to evaluate the quality of the selected observational studies. Results: The eight included studies encompassed a total of 2,916 cases and 6,678 controls. The pooled ORs of colorectal cancer for the highest versus lowest categories of blood circulating Vitamin D levels was 0.75 [95% CI, 0.58-0.97] up to 36.5 ng/mL in Asian population. There was heterogeneity among the studies (I2=53.9%, Pheterogeneity=0.034). The dose-response meta-analysis indicated a significant linear relationship (Pnon-linearity=0.11). An increment of 16 ng/mL in blood circulating Vitamin D level corresponded to an OR of 0.79 [95% CI, 0.64-0.97]. Conclusions: The results of this meta-analysis indicated that blood circulating Vitamin D level is associated with decreased risk of colorectal cancer in Asian countries. This dose-response meta-analysis further shows that the strength of this association among Asian population is similar to that among Western population. Our study suggested that Asian population should improve nutritional status and maintain a higher level of blood circulating Vitamin D.","Zhang, L.; Zou, H.; Zhao, Y.; Hu, C.; Atanda, A.; Qin, X.; Jia, P.; Jiang, Y.; Qi, Z.",20191025,"Oncology","10.1101/19000828",1,"Zhihong Qi","Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Clinical Laboratory Beijing, CN","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000828v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000828v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd","10.1136/bmjopen-2019-030513","All data relevant to the study are included in the article or uploaded as supplementary information."
32,"An acute bleomycin inflammatory and fibrotic mouse model of morphea is dependent upon CXCL9 and CXCR3","Morphea, or localized scleroderma, is characterized by an inflammatory phase followed by cutaneous fibrosis, which may lead to disfigurement and/or disability. Previous work from our group showed that the CXCR3 ligands CXCL9 and CXCL10 are highly upregulated in lesional skin of morphea patients. Here, we used an acute inflammatory and fibrotic bleomycin mouse model of morphea to examine the role of the CXCR3 chemokine axis in pathogenesis. We first characterized which cells produce the CXCR3 ligands in the skin using the Reporter of Expression of CXCR3 ligands mouse (REX3). We found that fibroblasts contribute the bulk of CXCL9 and CXCL10, whereas endothelial cells are key dual chemokine producers. Macrophages, which have high MFI of chemokine expression, upregulated CXCL9 production over time, fibroblasts CXCL10 production, and T cells dual chemokine expression. To determine whether bleomycin treatment could directly induce expression of these chemokines, we treated cultured REX3 mouse dermis monolayers in vitro with bleomycin or IFN{gamma} with TNF and found that bleomycin could induce low amounts of CXCL9 directly in fibroblasts, whereas the cytokines were required for optimal CXCL9 and CXCL10 production. To determine whether these chemokines are mechanistically involved in pathogenesis, we induced fibrosis in CXCL9, CXCL10, or CXCR3 deficient mice and found that fibrosis is dependent on CXCL9 and CXCR3. Addition of recombinant CXCL9, but not CXCL10, to cultured mouse fibroblasts induces collagen 1a1 mRNA expression, indicating the chemokine itself can contribute to fibrosis. Taken together, our studies provide evidence that acute intradermal bleomycin administration in mice can model inflammatory morphea, and that CXCL9 and its receptor CXCR3 are mechanistically involved in pathogenesis.","Richmond, J.

34,"SEXUAL BEHAVIOURS AND EXPERIENCE OF SEXUAL COERCION AMONG IN-SCHOOL FEMALE ADOLESCENT IN SOUTHWESTERN NIGERIA","Most people begin their sexual relationship during adolescence and some get involved in risky life threatening behaviors such as unwanted pregnancies, abortions and sexually transmitted infections. This study was therefore designed to understand the patterns of female adolescents sexual behaviours and sexual coercion experience. A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out among 1227 in-school adolescents in the three senatorial district of Osun State, Southwestern Nigeria. Multi-stage sampling technique was used to select the respondents, and data were collected with pre-tested, semi-structured questionnaires. The data collected were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 21). Three hundred and thirty seven (27.5%) were sexually exposed with a mean age of sexual initiation of 14 years. Of the 337 that were sexually exposed 153(56.5%) initiated sex early between the ages of 10-15 years, while (4.7%) had uses drugs or take alcohol before sexual intercourse. Findings revealed that of those that were sexually exposed, 122(11%) were forced to have sex, 101(9.1%) played sex willingly, while 29(2.6%) felt threatened and 3(0.3%) were convinced with money. The proportion of the respondent who reported rape and abduction was (2.6%). Finding from this study is consistent with earlier studies conducted in many other Nigerian cities which showed that in-school adolescents to be sexually active. There is the need to step up campaigns to address this noticed lapse in behavior among the students in order to arrest the usual consequences of such risky sexual behavior.","Owolodun, B.

44,"A Needs Analysis of Parents Following Sudden Cardiac Death in the Young","The sudden cardiac death (SCD) of a young person is a devastating event for any parent. Inherited heart disease is often either identified or assumed to be the cause. Few studies have explored the psychosocial impact to the surviving at-risk family members. We sought to investigate the needs of parents who have experienced the SCD of their child ([&le;]45 years). A quantitative needs analysis questionnaire was developed based on semi-structured interviews, including one focus group, and a review of relevant literature. There were 38 parents who completed a cross-sectional quantitative survey. Parents perceived needs for information and support spanned medical, psychosocial, spiritual and financial domains. Medical information and support needs were identified as the most important domains, followed by psychosocial, spiritual and financial information and support needs. Importantly, psychosocial information and support needs were reported as the most unmet need, endorsed by 54% of parents. Medical information and support needs were reported as unmet by almost one third of parents. The two most endorsed needs were ''To have the option of whether or not you would pursue genetic testing for yourself or family members'' and ''To understand what happened''. This work demonstrates for the first time, the multifactorial needs of parents after SCD in the young. With the greatest unmet need reported as psychosocial needs, there is clear necessity to find ways of integrating psychological support in to the care of families after SCD in the young.","Mcdonald, K.; Sharpe, L.; Yeates, L.; Semsarian, C.; Ingles, J.",20190703,"Cardiovascular Medicine","10.1101/19000877",1,"Jodie Ingles","Centenary Institute, The University of Sydney","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000877v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000877v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"Data will be provided upon request to the corresponding author."
33,"Trends and variation in unsafe prescribing of methotrexate: a cohort study in English NHS primary care.","Objective To describe trends and geographical variation in methotrexate prescribing that breaches national safety recommendations; deaths from methotrexate poisoning; and associated litigation. Methods A retrospective cohort study of English NHS primary care prescribing data, complemented by information obtained through Freedom of Information (FOI) requests. The main outcome measures were: (1) variation in ratio of breaching / adherent prescribing, geographically and over time, between General Practices and Clinical Commissioning Groups; (2) description of responses to FOI requests. Results Out of 7349 NHS General Practices in England, 1689 practices prescribed both 2.5mg and 10mg tablets to individual patients in 2017, breaching national guidance. In April 2018, 697 practices (at the 90th centile and above) prescribed at least 14.3% of all methotrexate as 10mg tablets, breaching national guidance. The 66 practices at the 99th percentile and above gave at least 52.4% of all prescribed methotrexate in the form of 10 mg tablets. The prescribing of 10mg tablets has fallen over 7 years, with 10mg tablets as a proportion of all methotrexate tablets falling from 9.1% to 3.4%. 21 deaths caused by methotrexate poisoning have been reported from 1993-2017. Conclusions The prevalence of unsafe methotrexate prescribing has reduced but it remains common, with substantial variation between organisations. We recommend the NHS invests in better strategies around implementation of safety recommendations. 21 deaths have been attributed to methotrexate poisoning but with no further details easily available: the full coroners reports for these deaths should be reviewed to identify recurring themes.","Mackenna, B.; Curtis, H.

Methods: Six-echo Dixon imaging was performed in the liver of 89 subjects. The first acquisition variant used acceleration based on SENSE with a total acceleration factor equal to 2.64 (acquisition labeled as SENSE). The second acquisition variant used acceleration based on a combination of CS with SENSE with a total acceleration factor equal to 4 (acquisition labeled as CS+SENSE). Acquisition times were compared between acquisitions and proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and T2*-values were measured and compared separately for each liver segment. Results: Total scan duration was 14.5 sec for the SENSE accelerated image acquisition and 9.3 sec for the CS+SENSE accelerated image acquisition. PDFF and T2* values did not differ significantly between the two acquisitions (paired Mann-Whitney and paired t-test P>0.05 in all cases). CS+SENSE accelerated acquisition showed reduced motion artifacts (1.1%) compared to SENSE acquisition (12.3%). Conclusion: CS+SENSE accelerates liver PDFF and T2*mapping while retaining the same quantitative values as an acquisition using only SENSE and reduces motion artifacts.","Lohoefer, F. K.; Kaissis, G.

97,"Confounding adjustment performance of ordinal analysis methods in stroke studies","Background: In acute stroke studies, ordinal logistic regression (OLR) is often used to analyze outcome on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), whereas the non-parametric Mann-Whitney measure of superiority (MWS) has also been suggested. It is unclear how these perform comparatively when confounding adjustment is warranted. Our aim is to quantify the performance of OLR and MWS in different confounding variable settings. Methods: We set up a simulation study with three different scenarios; (1) dichotomous confounding variables, (2) continuous confounding variables, and (3) confounding variable settings mimicking a study on functional outcome after stroke. We compared adjusted ordinal logistic regression (aOLR) and stratified Mann-Whitney measure of superiority (sMWS), and also used propensity scores to stratify the MWS (psMWS). For comparability, OLR estimates were transformed to a MWS. We report bias, the percentage of runs that produced a point estimate deviating by more than 0.05 points (point estimate variation), and the coverage probability. Results: In scenario 1, there was no bias in both sMWS and aOLR, with similar point estimate variation and coverage probabilities. In scenario 2, sMWS resulted in more bias (0.04 versus 0.00), and higher point estimate variation (41.6% versus 3.3%), whereas coverage probabilities were similar. In scenario 3, there was no bias in both methods, point estimate variation was higher in the sMWS (6.7%) versus aOLR (1.1%), and coverage probabilities were 0.98 (sMWS) versus 0.95 (aOLR). With psMWS, bias remained 0.00, with less point estimate variation (1.5%) and a coverage probability of 0.95. Conclusions: The bias of both adjustment methods was similar in our stroke simulation scenario, and the higher point estimate variation in the MWS improved with propensity score based stratification. The stratified MWS is a valid alternative for adjusted OLR only when the ratio of number of strata versus number of observations is relatively low, but propensity score based stratification extends the application range of the MWS.","Zonneveld, T.

64,"Oncofetal Protein Cripto-1 in a new clinical role: a potential tumor marker for Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.","PURPOSE: CR-1 (CR-1) is an oncofetal protein with its role as a key factor in early process of carcinoma has been evaluated in cases of various cancers. However, very few studies have reported its role in oral cancers, which is the sixth most common cancer around the world, particularly with high prevalence in developing countries. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most predominant (90%) of all the histological types of oral cancer. Late detection, associated with increased morbidity and mortality, is mainly attributed to non-availability of a suitable biomarker for the disease. In the present pilot study we have evaluated the role of soluble CR-1, in serum as a potential tumor marker for OSCC. METHODS: CR-1 was estimated using sandwich ELISA in serum samples of 50 biopsy proven OSCC patients (pre and post treatment) along with age and gender matched healthy controls. Immunohistochemistry was also done in corresponding tumor tissue sections to check the expression of CR-1. RESULTS: Pre-treatment CR-1 was found to be 2.25 fold higher in serum of OSCC patients as compared to control (p<0.0001***), which was reduced to 1.6 folds post treatment (p=0.0006***). CR-1 levels were comparatively higher in early stage of disease. Upon IHC 80% of the cases were found to be positive for CR-1. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that serum levels of CR-1 are elevated in patients of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma, which decrease post treatment. Also, the association of expression of protein with tumor progression predicts CR-1 as a molecule that can be further evaluated as a potential tumor maker in OSCC.","Jain, A.; Mallupattu, S.

47,"Liver function tests and fibrosis scores in a rural population in Africa: estimation of the burden of disease and associated risk factors","Introduction: Liver disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. However, its prevalence, distribution and aetiology have not been well characterised. We examined liver function tests (LFTs) and calculated liver fibrosis scores in a rural population in Uganda. Methodology: A cross-sectional survey of LFTs was undertaken in 2011 in a rural population cohort in South-Western Uganda. We classified abnormal LFTs based on reference ranges set in America and in Africa. We derived fibrosis scores (AST to Platelet Ratio Index, fibrosis-4, GGT to platelet ratio, red cell distribution width to platelet ratio, and S-index) to evaluate the potential prevalence of liver disease. We collected information about alcohol intake, and infection with HIV, HBV and HCV, to determine the contribution made by these factors to liver inflammation or fibrosis. Results: Data were available for 8,099 participants (median age 30 years; 56% female). The prevalence of HBV, HCV and HIV infection were 3%, 0.2% and 8%, respectively. The prevalence of abnormal LFTs was higher based on the American reference range compared to the African reference range (e.g. for AST 13% vs 3%, respectively). The prevalence of AST/ALT ratio >2 was 11%, suggestive of alcoholic hepatitis. The highest prevalence of fibrosis was suggested by the GPR score, with 24% of the population falling above the threshold for fibrosis. By multivariate analysis, elevated LFTs and fibrosis scores were most consistently associated with older age, male sex, being under-weight, infection with HIV or HBV, and alcohol consumption. Based on population attributable risk, the highest proportion of elevated fibrosis scores was associated with alcohol use (e.g. 64% of elevated S-index scores). Conclusion: Further work is required to determine normal reference ranges for LFTs in this setting, to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of fibrosis scores, and to determine aetiology of liver disease.","O'hara, G.; Mokaya, J.; Hau, J.

25,"Current characteristics and outcomes of Cytomegalovirus Reactivation in kidney transplant seropositive recipients in the era of prophylaxis treatment. Lesson from single Moroccan center experience.","Despite the use of antiviral prophylaxis, the active cytomegalovirus (CMV) replication is still occurred in the seropositive kidney recipients. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of CMV reactivation and potential risk factors associated with CMV disease. Data of sixty kidney transplant recipients who had received CMV prophylaxis were obtained between 2013 and 2017. Quantitative nucleic acid amplification testing for CMV viraemia was assessed using Abbott RealTime Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Among the seropositive recipients, cumulative incidence for reactivation was 63%. In patients with quantitative viraemia, the time of active replication was significantly lower compared to those with detectable viraemia (141.5, SD:96.9 vs 294.1, SD: 112.6 days, P inferior to 0.001). During prophylactic treatment, 46.7% of patients with quantifiable viraemia had experienced active replication and none among patients with detectable viraemia (P= 0.017). Importantly, symptomatic reactivation was significantly observed in the younger patients with higher peak viraemia compared to those with symptoms free (28.8, SD:5.12 vs. 38.1, SD: 12.34 years, P= 0.007) and 3.8, SD: 1.59 vs. 2.4, SD: 0. 79 log10IU/ml, P = 0.003, respectively). Furthermore, the median duration of viraemia (21.2, vs. 13.4 days, P= 0.028) and period of CMV therapy (24.3 vs 12.3 days, P inferior to 0.001) were significantly longer for this group. In addition, intercurrent infections (75% vs. 23%, P = 0.028 ) and acute rejection (50 % vs 0%, P = 0.003) were significantly more frequent in symptomatic reactivation group. In addition, peak viral load was a potential risk factor for development of symptomatic reactivation with odds ratio 3.39, 95%CI=1.21-9.53, P = 0.02). In conclusion, CMV reactivation remains serious problem for seropositive recipients who were expected to be on antiviral prophylaxis. Patients with high level of viraemia may be at an increased risk of progression to CMV disease and adverse outcomes.","Rezzouk, B.; Bouattar, T.; Belkadi, B.; Razine, R.; Bayahia, R.; Ouzeddoun, N.; Benamar, L.; Rhou, H.; Bouihat, N.; Ibrahimi, A.; Seffar, M.; Kabbaj, H.",20190628,"Infectious Diseases","10.1101/19001008",1,"Bouchra Rezzouk","Laboratory of Microbiology and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, University Mohammed V, Rabat, Morocco.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001008v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001008v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"All relevant data are within the manuscript."
169,"Medication errors during simulated paediatric resuscitations: a prospective, observational human reliability analysis","Introduction: Medication errors during paediatric resuscitation are thought to be common. However, there is little evidence about the individual process steps that contribute to such medication errors in this context. Objectives: To describe the incidence, nature and severity of medication errors in simulated paediatric resuscitations, and to employ human reliability analysis to understand the contributory role of individual process step discrepancies to these errors. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study of simulated resuscitations subject to video micro-analysis, identification of medication errors, severity assessment and human reliability analysis in a large English teaching hospital. Fifteen resuscitation teams of two doctors and two nurses each conducted one of two simulated paediatric resuscitation scenarios. Results: At least one medication error was observed in every simulated case, and a large magnitude or clinically significant error in 11 of 15 cases. Medication errors were observed in 29% of 180 simulated medication administrations, 40% of which considered to be moderate or severe. These errors were the result of 884 observed discrepancies at a number of steps in the drug ordering, preparation and administration stages of medication use, 8% of which made a major contribution to a resultant medication error. Most errors were introduced by discrepancies during drug preparation and administration. Conclusions: Medication errors were common with a considerable proportion likely to result in patient harm. There is an urgent need to optimise existing systems and to commission research into new approaches to increase the reliability of human interactions during administration of medication in the paediatric emergency setting.","Appelbaum, N.; Clarke, J.; Feather, C.; Dean Franklin, B.; Sinha, R.; Pratt, P.; Maconochie, I.; Darzi, A.",20190802,"Pediatrics","10.1101/19001016",2,"Calandra Feather","NIHR-Imperial Patient Safety Translational Research Centre, Imperial College London","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001016v2?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001016v2.full.pdf","cc_by","10.1136/bmjopen-2019-032686","All data relevant to the study are included in the article or uploaded as supplementary information"
98,"Disease overarching mechanisms that explain and predict outcome of patients with high cardiovascular risk: rationale and design of the Berlin Long-term Observation of Vascular Events (BeLOVE) study","Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of premature death worldwide. Effective and individualized treatment requires exact knowledge about both risk factors and risk estimation. Most evidence for risk prediction currently comes from population-based studies on first incident cardiovascular events. In contrast, little is known about the relevance of risk factors for the outcome of patients with established CVD or those who are at high risk of CVD, including patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition, most studies focus on individual diseases, whereas less is known about disease overarching risk factors and cross-over risk. Aim: The aim of BeLOVE is to improve short- and long-term prediction and mechanistic understanding of cardiovascular disease progression and outcomes in very high-risk patients, both in the acute as well as in the chronic phase, in order to provide the basis for improved, individualized management. Study design: BeLOVE is an observational prospective cohort study of patients of both sexes aged >18 in selected Berlin hospitals, who have a high risk of future cardiovascular events, including patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), acute stroke (AS), acute heart failure (AHF), acute kidney injury (AKI) or type 2 diabetes with manifest target-organ damage. BeLOVE includes 2 subcohorts: The acute subcohort includes 6500 patients with ACS, AS, AHF, or AKI within 2-8 days after their qualifying event, who undergo a structured interview about medical history as well as blood sample collection. The chronic subcohort includes 6000 patients with ACS, AS, AHF, or AKI 90 days after event, and patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and target-organ damage. These patients undergo a 6-8 hour deep phenotyping program, including detailed clinical phenotyping from a cardiological, neurological and metabolic perspective, questionnaires including patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)as well as magnetic resonance imaging. Several biological samples are collected (i.e. blood, urine, saliva, stool) with blood samples collected in a fasting state, as well as after a metabolic challenge (either nutritional or cardiopulmonary exercise stress test). Ascertainment of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) will be performed in all patients using a combination of active and passive follow up procedures, such as on-site visits (if applicable), telephone interviews, review of medical charts, and links to local health authorities. Additional phenotyping visits are planned at 2, 5 and 10 years after inclusion into the chronic subcohort. Future perspective: BeLOVE provides a unique opportunity to study both the short- and long-term disease course of patients at high cardiovascular risk through innovative and extensive deep phenotyping. Moreover, the unique study design provides opportunities for acute and post-acute inclusion and allows us to derive two non-nested yet overlapping sub-cohorts, tailored for upcoming research questions. Thereby, we aim to study disease overarching research questions, to understand crossover risk, and to find similarities and differences between clinical phenotypes of patients at high cardiovascular risk.","Siegerink, B.; Weber, J.; Ahmadi, M.; Eckardt, K.-U.; Edelmann, F.; Endres, M.; Gerhardt, H.; Haubold, K.; Hubner, N.; Landmesser, U.; Leistner, D.; Mai, K.; Muller, D.

190,"Identifying Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA1/2 founder variants in individuals who do not self-report Jewish ancestry","Current guidelines recommend BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic testing for individuals with a personal or family history of certain cancers. Three BRCA1/2 founder variants -- 185delAG (c.68_69delAG), 5382insC (c.5266dupC), and 6174delT (c.5946delT) -- are common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. We characterized a cohort of more than 2,800 research participants in the 23andMe database who carry one or more of the three Ashkenazi Jewish founder variants, evaluating two characteristics that are typically used to recommend individuals for BRCA testing: self-reported Jewish ancestry and family history of breast, ovarian, prostate, or pancreatic cancer. Of the 1,967 carriers who provided self-reported ancestry information, 21% did not self-report any Jewish ancestry; of these individuals, more than half (62%) do have detectable Ashkenazi Jewish genetic ancestry. In addition, of the 343 carriers who provided both ancestry and family history information, 44% did not have a first-degree family history of a BRCA-related cancer and, in the absence of a personal history of cancer, would therefore be unlikely to qualify for clinical genetic testing. These findings provide support for the growing call for broader access to BRCA genetic testing.","Tennen, R. I.; Laskey, S. B.; Koelsch, B. L.; Mcintyre, M. H.; The 23andme Health Team,  ; Tung, J.

41,"Machine learning to predict early recurrence after oesophageal cancer surgery","Objective: To develop a predictive model for early recurrence after surgery for oesophageal adenocarcinoma using a large multi-national cohort. Summary Background Data: Early cancer recurrence after oesophagectomy is a common problem with an incidence of 20-30% despite the widespread use of neoadjuvant treatment. Quantification of this risk is difficult and existing models perform poorly. Machine learning techniques potentially allow more accurate prognostication and have been applied in this study. Methods: Consecutive patients who underwent oesophagectomy for adenocarcinoma and had neoadjuvant treatment in 6 UK and 1 Dutch oesophago-gastric units were analysed. Using clinical characteristics and post-operative histopathology, models were generated using elastic net regression (ELR) and the machine learning methods random forest (RF) and XG boost (XGB). Finally, a combined (Ensemble) model of these was generated. The relative importance of factors to outcome was calculated as a percentage contribution to the model. Result: In total 812 patients were included. The recurrence rate at less than 1 year was 29.1%. All of the models demonstrated good discrimination. Internally validated AUCs were similar, with the Ensemble model performing best (ELR=0.785, RF=0.789, XGB=0.794, Ensemble=0.806). Performance was similar when using internal-external validation (validation across sites, Ensemble AUC=0.804). In the final model the most important variables were number of positive lymph nodes (25.7%) and vascular invasion (16.9%). Conclusions: The derived model using machine learning approaches and an international dataset provided excellent performance in quantifying the risk of early recurrence after surgery and will be useful in prognostication for clinicians and patients.","Rahman, S.; Walker, R.

24,"Forecasting the impact of population ageing on tuberculosis incidence","Background: Tuberculosis (TB) disease reactivates from distant latent infection or recent (re)infection. Progression risks increase with age. Across the World Health Organisation Western Pacific region, many populations are ageing and have the highest per capita TB incidence rates in older age groups. However, methods for analysing age-specific TB incidence and forecasting epidemic trends while accounting for demographic change remain limited. Methods: We applied the Lee-Carter models, which were originally developed for mortality modelling, to model the temporal trends in age-specific TB incidence data from 2005 to 2018 in Taiwan. Females and males were modelled separately. We combined our demographic forecasts, and age-specific TB incidence forecasts to project TB incidence until 2035. We compared TB incidence projections with demography fixed in 2018 to projections accounting for demographic change. Results: Our models quantified increasing incidence rates with age and declining temporal trends. By 2035, the forecast suggests that the TB incidence rate in Taiwan will decrease by 54% (95% Prediction Interval (PI): 45%-59%) compared to 2015, while most age-specific incidence rates will reduce by more than 60%. In 2035, adults aged 65 and above will make up 78% of incident TB cases. Forecast TB incidence in 2035 accounting for demographic change will be 39% (95% PI: 36%-42%) higher than without population ageing. Conclusions: Age-specific incidence forecasts coupled with demographic forecasts can inform the impact of population ageing on TB epidemics. The TB control programme in Taiwan should develop plans specific to older age groups and their care needs.","Chu-Chang Ku; Peter J Dodd",20190628,"Epidemiology","10.1101/19001115",1,"Chu-Chang Ku","School of Health and Related Research, University of Sheffield","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001115v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001115v1.full.pdf","cc_by","10.1371/journal.pone.0222937","All analysis code and formatted data are available from the GitHub repository [https://github.com/TimeWz667/AgeingTB]"
23,"Epigenetic prediction of major depressive disorder","Objective: DNA methylation (DNAm) is associated with environmental risk factors for major depressive disorder (MDD) but has not yet been tested for its ability to discriminate individuals with MDD from unaffected individuals. Methods: Using penalized regression based on genome-wide CpG methylation, we trained a DNAm risk score of MDD (DNAm-RS) in 1,223 cases and 1,824 controls and tested in a second independent sample of 363 prevalent cases and 1,417 controls. Using DNA from 1,607 unaffected individuals, we tested whether DNAm-RS could discriminate the 190 incident cases of lifetime MDD from the 1,417 individuals who remained unaffected at follow-up. Results: A weighted linear combination of 196 CpG sites were derived from the training sample to form a DNAm-RS. The DNAm-RS explained 1.75% of the variance in MDD risk in an independent case-control sample and significantly predicted future incident episodes of MDD at follow up (R2=0.52%). DNAm-RS and MDD polygenic risk scores together additively explained 3.99% of the variance in prevalent MDD. The DNAm-RS was also significantly associated with lifestyle factors associated with MDD, including smoking status ({beta}=0.440, p=<2x10-16) and alcohol use ({beta}=0.092, p=9.85x10-5). The DNAm-RS remained significantly associated with MDD after adjustment for these environmental factors (independent association: {beta}=0.338, p=1.17x10-7 association post-adjustment: {beta}=0.081, p=0.0006). Conclusions: A novel risk score of MDD based on DNAm data significantly discriminated MDD cases from controls in an independent dataset, and controls who would subsequently develop MDD from those who remained unaffected. DNAm-RS captured the effects of exposure to key lifestyle risk factors for MDD, revealing a potential role in risk stratification.","Miruna C Barbu; Rosie M Walker; David M Howard; Kathryn L Evans; Heather C Whalley; David J Porteous; Stewart W Morris; Ian J Deary; Riccardo E Marioni; Toni-Kim Clarke; Andrew M Mcintosh",20190628,"Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology","10.1101/19001123",1,"Andrew M Mcintosh","University of Edinburgh","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001123v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001123v1.full.pdf","cc_by",NA,"The predictor detailed in the manuscript is available in the supplementary Excel file.

40,"Aerobic capacity predicts skeletal but not cardiac muscle damage after a full distance Ironman triathlon - the Iron(wo)man-study","Purpose: This study examines the association between aerobic capacity and biomarkers of skeletal- and cardiac muscle damage among amateur triathletes after a full distance Ironman Methods: Men and women (N=55) were recruited from local sport clubs. One month before an Ironman triathlon, they conducted a 20m shuttle run test to determine aerobic capacity. Blood samples were taken immediately after finishing the triathlon, and analyzed for biomarkers of cardiac- and skeletal muscle damage. Regression models examining the association between aerobic capacity expressed in both relative terms (mLO2*kg-1*min-1) and absolute terms (LO2*min-1) controlled for weight and were fitted. Result: A total of 39 subjects (26% females) had complete data and were included in the analysis. No association between aerobic capacity and cardiac muscle damage but a significant negative association between aerobic capacity and skeletal muscle damage was observed. This association was independent of how aerobic capacity was expressed, although the model with aerobic capacity expressed in absolute terms and controlled for weight resulted in slightly higher r2 values, than when aerobic capacity was expressed in relative terms. Conclusion: A negative association between aerobic capacity and skeletal muscle damage was seen but despite the well-known cardio-protective health effect of high aerobic fitness no such association could be observed in this study.","Danielsson, T.; Carlsson, J.; Ten Siethoff, L.; Ahnesjo, J.; Bergman, P.",20190703,"Sports Medicine","10.1101/19001149",1,"Patrick Bergman","Linnaeus University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001149v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001149v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"Data can be retrieved from the corresponding author at a reasonable request"
53,"Intermittent Lactobacilli-containing Vaginal Probiotic or Metronidazole Use to Prevent Bacterial Vaginosis Recurrence: Safety and Preliminary Efficacy by Microscopy and Sequencing","Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is associated with HIV acquisition and adverse pregnancy outcomes. Recurrence after metronidazole treatment is high. HIV-negative, non-pregnant Rwandan BV patients were randomized to four groups (n=17/group) after seven-day oral metronidazole treatment: behavioral counseling only (control), or counseling plus intermittent use of oral metronidazole, Ecologic Femi+ vaginal capsule (containing multiple Lactobacillus and one Bifidobacterium species), or Gynophilus LP vaginal tablet (L. rhamnosus 35) for two months. Vaginal microbiota assessments at all visits included Gram stain Nugent scoring and 16S rRNA gene qPCR and HiSeq sequencing. All interventions were safe. BV (Nugent 7-10) incidence was 10.18 per person-year at risk in the control group, and lower in the metronidazole (1.41/person-year; p=0.004), Ecologic Femi+ (3.58/person-year; p=0.043), and Gynophilus LP groups (5.36/person-year; p=0.220). In mixed effects models adjusted for hormonal contraception/pregnancy, sexual risk-taking, and age, metronidazole and Ecologic Femi+ users, each compared to controls, had higher Lactobacillus and lower BV-anaerobes concentrations and/or relative abundances, and were less likely to have a dysbiotic vaginal microbiota type by sequencing. Inter-individual variability was high and effects disappeared soon after intervention cessation. Lactobacilli-based vaginal probiotics warrant further evaluation because, in contrast to antibiotics, they are not expected to negatively affect microbiota or cause antimicrobial resistance.","Van De Wijgert, J.; Verwijs, M.

113,"Association between myopia and peripapillary hyperreflective ovoid mass-like structures in children","Purpose: To investigate the characteristics of children with peripapillary hyperreflective ovoid mass-like structures (PHOMS) and evaluate the risk factors associated with PHOMS. Methods: This study included 132 eyes of 66 children with PHOMS and 92 eyes of 46 children without PHOMS (controls) who were assessed by disc enhanced depth image spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). Univariable and multivariable logistic analyses were performed to evaluate risk factors associated with the presence of PHOMS. Results: Among the 66 children with PHOMS, 53 patients (80.3%) had bilateral and 13 patients (19.7%) had unilateral PHOMS. The mean age of the PHOMS group was 11.7 {+/-} 2.6 years and 11.4 {+/-} 3.1 years in the control group. Mean spherical equivalent (SE) by cycloplegic refraction was -3.13 {+/-} 1.87 diopters (D) in the PHOMS group and -0.95 {+/-} 2.65 D in the control group. Mean astigmatism was 0.67 {+/-} 0.89 D and 0.88 {+/-} 1.02 D in the PHOMS group and the control group, respectively. Mean disc size was 1735 {+/-} 153  in the PHOMS group and 1741 {+/-} 190  in the control group. All eyes in PHOMS group had myopia of -0.50 D or less, except for an eye with +1.00 D.

69,"Detection of malaria parasites in dried human blood spots using mid-infrared spectroscopy and logistic regression analysis","Background: Epidemiological surveys of malaria currently rely on microscopy, polymerase chain reaction assays (PCR) or rapid diagnostic test kits for Plasmodium infections (RDTs). This study shows that mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy coupled with supervised machine learning could constitute an alternative method for rapid malaria screening, directly from dried human blood spots. Methods: Filter papers containing dried blood spots (DBS) were obtained from a cross-sectional malaria survey in twelve wards in south-eastern Tanzania in 2018/19. The DBS were scanned using attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectrometer to obtain high-resolution MIR spectra in the range, 4000 cm-1 to 500 cm-1. The spectra were cleaned to compensate for atmospheric water vapor and CO2 interference bands and used to train different classification algorithms to distinguish between malaria-positive and malaria-negative DBS papers based on PCR test results as reference. The analysis considered 296 individuals, including 123 PCR-confirmed malaria-positives and 173 negatives. Model training was done using 80% of the dataset, after which the best-fitting model was optimized by bootstrapping of 80/20 train/test stratified splits. The trained models were evaluated by predicting Plasmodium falciparum positivity in the 20% validation set of DBS. Results: Logistic regression was the best-performing model. Considering PCR as reference, the models attained overall accuracies of 92% for predicting P. falciparum infections (specificity = 91.7%; sensitivity = 92.8%) and 85% for predicting mixed infections of P. falciparum and P. ovale (specificity = 85%, sensitivity = 85%) in the field-collected specimen. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that mid-infrared spectroscopy coupled with supervised machine learning (MIR-ML) could be used to screen for malaria parasites in dried human blood spots. The approach could have potential for rapid and high-throughput screening of Plasmodium infections in both non-clinical settings (e.g. field surveys) and clinical settings (diagnosis to aid case management). However, full utility will require further advances in classification algorithms, field validation of this technology in other study sites and an in-depth evaluation of the biological basis of the observed test results. Training the models on larger datasets could also improve specificity and sensitivity of the technique. The MIR-ML spectroscopy system is robust, low-cost, and requires minimum maintenance.","Mwanga, E. P.; Minja, E. G.; Mrimi, E.; Gonzalez Jimenez, M.; Swai, J. K.; Abbas, S.; Ngowo, H. S.; Siria, D.

181,"Mental Health in UK Biobank Revised","This paper corrects and updates a paper published in BJPsych Open 2018 Mental Health in UK Biobank (https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2018.12) that was voluntarily retracted following the finding of errors in the coding of the variable for alcohol use disorder. Notably, the percentage of participants reaching threshold for alcohol use disorder on the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Tool increased from 7% to 21%. This paper includes corrections and updates. Background: UK Biobank is a well-characterised cohort of over 500,000 participants that offers unique opportunities to investigate multiple diseases and risk factors. An online mental health questionnaire completed by UK Biobank participants expands the potential for research into mental disorders. Methods: An expert working group designed the questionnaire, using established measures where possible, and consulting with a service user group regarding acceptability. Operational criteria were agreed for defining likely disorder and risk states, including lifetime depression, mania/hypomania, generalised anxiety disorder, unusual experiences and self-harm, and current post-traumatic stress and alcohol use disorders. Results: 157,366 completed online questionnaires were available by August 2017. Comparison of self-reported diagnosed mental disorder with a contemporary study shows a similar prevalence, despite respondents being of higher average socioeconomic status. Lifetime depression was the most common finding in 24% of participants (37,434), with current alcohol use disorder criteria met by 21% (32,602), while other criteria were met by less than 8% of the participants. There was extensive comorbidity among the syndromes. Mental disorders were associated with a high neuroticism score, adverse life events and long-term illness; addiction and bipolar affective disorder in particular were associated with measures of deprivation. Conclusions: The questionnaire represents a very large mental health survey in itself, and the results presented here show high face validity, although caution is needed due to selection bias. Built into UK Biobank, these data intersect with other health data to offer unparalleled potential for crosscutting biomedical research involving mental health.","Davis, K. A. S.; Coleman, J. R.

66,"Predicting Residual Function in Hemodialysis and Hemodiafiltration : A Population Kinetic, Decision Analytic Approach","In this study, we introduce a novel framework for the estimation of residual renal function (RRF), based on the population compartmental kinetic behavior of Beta 2 Microglobulin (B2M) and its dialytic removal. Using this model, we simulated a large cohort of patients with various levels of RRF receiving either conventional high-flux hemodialysis or on-line hemodiafiltration. These simulations were used to estimate a novel population kinetic (PK) equation for RRF (PK-RRF) that was validated in an external public dataset of real patients. We assessed the performance of the resulting equation(s) against their ability to estimate urea clearance using cross-validation. Our equations derived entirely from computer simulations and advanced statistical modeling, and had extremely high discrimination (AUC 0.808 - 0.909) when applied to a human dataset of measurements of RRF. A clearance-based equation that utilized pre and post dialysis B2M measurements, patient weight, treatment duration and ultrafiltration had higher discrimination than an equation previously derived in humans. Furthermore, the derived equations appeared to have higher clinical usefulness as assessed by Decision Curve Analysis, potentially supporting decisions that for individualizing dialysis frequency in patients with preserved RRF.","Achakzai, M.; Argyropoulos, C.; Roumelioti, M. - E.",20190709,"Nephrology","10.1101/19001222",2,"Christos Argyropoulos","Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Nephrology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001222v2?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001222v2.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd","10.3390/jcm8122080","All data and software code used in this paper are available from bitbucket"
52,"The effect of the genetic liability to autism spectrum disorder on emotion recognition in young unaffected probands from a population-based cohort","We investigated how ASD genetic risk relates to neurodevelopmental features (491 traits tested) via polygenic risk scoring (PRS) in 4,309 young non-ASD probands from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. ASD PRS most strongly associated with the ability to correctly identify angry facial emotions in youths aged 11-17 years (R2=1.06%, p=1.38x10-7) and replicated similarly in older probands (>18 years) (R2=0.55%, p=0.036). The association in 11-to-17-year-old probands was independent of other psychiatric disorders, brain imaging phenotypes, and educational attainment. ASD PRS also associated with proband-reported emotionality and connectedness with others. The proband-reported irritability trait was highly correlated with angry facial emotion recognition (r2=0.159, p=2.74x10-5) but was independently associated with ASD PRS (R2=1.20%, p=1.18x10-4). Several informant-reported (i.e., typically mother-reported) traits were predicted by the proband ASD PRS, including duration of fear (R2=0.156%, p=0.001). These data indicate how genetic liability to ASD may influence neurodevelopment in the general population, especially the development of emotional intelligence.","Wendt, F.

68,"Higher energy requirement during weight-loss maintenance on a low- versus high-carbohydrate diet: secondary analyses from a randomized controlled feeding study","Background: Longer-term feeding studies suggest that a low-carbohydrate diet increases energy expenditure, consistent with the carbohydrate-insulin model of obesity. However, the validity of methodology utilized in these studies, involving doubly-labeled water, has been questioned. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether dietary energy requirement for weight-loss maintenance is higher on a low- versus high-carbohydrate diet. Methods: The study reports secondary outcomes and exploratory analyses from a feeding study in which the primary outcome was total energy expenditure. After attaining a mean Run-in weight loss of 10.5%, 164 adults with pre-weight-loss BMI of [&ge;]25 were randomly assigned to Test diets containing Low (20%), Moderate (40%) or High (60%) carbohydrate for 20 weeks. Calorie content of Test diets was adjusted to maintain individual body weight within 2 kg of the post-weight-loss value. In analyses by Intention-to-Treat (ITT, study completers, n=148) and Per Protocol (PP, those achieving the weight-loss maintenance target, n=110), we compared estimated energy requirement from 10 to 20 weeks on the Test diets using ANCOVA. Insulin secretion was assessed pre-weight-loss as insulin concentration 30 minutes following 75 grams oral glucose (Insulin-30). Results: Estimated energy requirement was higher in the Low vs High group by models involving ITT (ranging from 181 [CI 8-353] to 223 [40-406] kcal/d; P[&le;];0.04) and PP (ranging from 245 [43-446] to 295 [91-499] kcal/d; P[&le;];0.02). This difference remained significant in sensitivity analyses accounting for change in adiposity and possible non-adherence. In observational analyses, pre-weight loss Insulin-30 predicted adverse change in body composition following weight loss. Conclusions: Energy requirement was higher on a low- versus high-carbohydrate diet during weight-loss maintenance, commensurate with total energy expenditure. These data are consistent with the carbohydrate-insulin model and lend qualified support for the validity of the doubly-labeled water method with diets varying in macronutrient composition.","Ebbeling, C.

The overall goal of this study was to determine the safety and tolerability of Aquamin when used as a dietary chemopreventative in humans. Additionally, we determined the effects of Aquamin on the colonic microbial community and attendant metabolomic profile. Thirty healthy male and female human participants were enrolled in a 90-day trial in which the effects of Aquamin (delivering 800 mg of calcium per day) were compared to those of calcium alone or placebo. Before and after the interventional period, colonic biopsies and stool specimens were obtained. All 30 participants completed the study without serious adverse events. There were no changes in liver function markers. Compared to pretreatment values, intervention with Aquamin led to a reduction in total bacterial DNA and a shift in the microbial community. Treatment with calcium alone also produced a decline in total bacteria, but smaller than seen with Aquamin, while no reduction was observed with placebo. In parallel with microbial changes, a reduction in bile acid levels and a slight increase in the level of the short chain fatty acid (SCFA) acetate in stool specimens from Aquamin-treated participants was noted. No change in bile acids or SCFAs was observed with calcium alone or placebo. We conclude from these studies that Aquamin is safe and tolerable in healthy human participants and may produce beneficial alterations in the colonic microbial community and the attendant metabolomic profile.","Aslam, M.

971,"Using collaboration networks to identify authorship bias in meta-analyses","Meta-analytic methods are powerful resources to summarize the existing evidence concerning a given research question, and are widely used in many academic fields. However, meta-analyses can be vulnerable to various sources of bias, which should be considered to avoid inaccuracies. Many of these sources can be related to study authorship, as both methodological choices and researcher bias may lead to deviations in results between different research groups. In this work, we describe a method to objectively attribute study authorship within a given meta-analysis to different research groups by using graph cluster analysis of collaboration networks. We then provide empirical examples of how the research group of origin can impact effect size in distinct types of meta-analyses, demonstrating how non-independence between within-group results can bias effect size estimates if uncorrected. Finally, we show that multilevel random-effects models using research group as a level of analysis can be a simple tool for correcting biases related to study authorship.","Moulin, T. C.; Amaral, O.

105,"The global scientific research response to the public health emergency of Zika virus infection","Background: Science studies have been a field of research for different knowledge areas and they have been successfully used to analyse the construction of scientific knowledge, practice and dissemination. In this study, we aimed to verify how the Zika epidemic has moulded scientific production worldwide analysing international collaboration and the knowledge landscape through time, research topics and country involvement. Methodology: We searched the Web of Science (WoS) for studies published up to 31st December 2018 on Zika using the search terms zika, zkv or zikv. We analysed the scientific production regarding which countries have published the most, on which topics, as well as country level collaboration. We performed a scientometric analysis of research on Zika focusing on knowledge mapping and the scientific research path over time and space. Findings: We found two well defined research areas divided into three subtopics accounting for six clusters. With regard to country analysis, the USA followed by Brazil were the leading countries in publications on Zika. China entered as a new player focusing on specific research areas. When we took into consideration the epidemics and reported cases, Brazil and France were the leading research countries on related topics. As for international collaboration, the USA followed by England and France stand out as the main hubs. The research areas most published included public health related topics from 2015 until the very beginning of 2016, followed by an increase in topics related to the clinical aspects of the disease in 2016 and the beginnings of laboratorial research in 2017/2018. Conclusions: Mapping the response to Zika, a public health emergency, demonstrated a clear pattern of the participation of countries in the scientific advances. The pattern of knowledge production found in this study represented the different perspectives and interests of countries based firstly on their level of exposure to the epidemic and secondly on their financial positions with regard to science.","Oliveira, J.

45,"Accuracy of ECG Chest Electrode Placements by Paramedics; an observational study","Background: The use of the 12-lead ECG is common in UK paramedic practice but its value depends upon accurate placement of the ECG-electrodes. Several studies have shown widespread variation in the placement of chest electrodes by other health professionals but no studies have addressed the accuracy of paramedics. The main objective of this study was to ascertain the accuracy of the chest lead placements by registered paramedics. Methods: Registered paramedics who attended the Emergency Services Show in Birmingham in September 2018 were invited to participate in this observational study. Participants were asked to place the chest electrodes on a male model in accordance with their current practice. Correct positioning was determined against the Society for Cardiological Science & Technology's Clinical Guidelines for recording a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (2017) with a tolerance of 19mm being deemed acceptable based upon previous studies. Results: 52 eligible participants completed the study. Measurement of electrode placement in the craniocaudal and mediolateral planes showed a high level of inaccuracy with 3/52 (5.8%) participants able to accurately place all chest leads. In leads V1 - V3, the majority of incorrect placements were related to vertical displacement with most participants able to identify the correct horizontal position. In V4, the tendency was to place the lead too low and to the left of the pre-determined position whilst V5 tended to be below the expected positioning but in the correct horizontal alignment. There was a less defined pattern of error in V6 although vertical displacement was more likely than horizontal displacement. Conclusion: Our study identified a high level of variation in the placement of chest ECG electrodes which could alter the morphology of the ECG. From a patient safety perspective, we would advocate that paramedics leave the chest electrodes in situ to allow hospital staff to assess the accuracy of the placements.","Gregory, P.; Lodge, S.; Kilner, T.; Paget, S.",20190703,"Emergency Medicine","10.1101/19001321",1,"Pete Gregory","University of Wolverhampton","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001321v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001321v1.full.pdf","cc_no","10.29045/14784726.2019.12.4.3.51","The data are deidentified participant data and will be available from Pete Gregory: pete.gregory@wlv.ac.uk.

43,"The impact of involving young children in improving the understanding of a new eye test","Background. Although considered important, the involvement of young children in research is rare and its impact has never been measured. We aim to provide a good practice example of involvement of young children in the development of a tablet-based 3D eye test or stereotest, ASTEROID. We focus on improving understanding of test instructions. Methods. After a pre-measure of understanding was taken, we explored issues with the test instructions in patient and public involvement (PPI) sessions. Feedback was collected via observations, rating scales and children's comments. An interdisciplinary panel reviewed the feedback and decided on the implementation. Subsequently, a post-measure was collected. In Study 1, 650 children (2-11.8 years old) took part in the pre-measure, 111 children (1-12 years old) in the PPI sessions, and 52 children (4-6 years old) in the post-measure which also served as a pre-measure for Study 2. PPI sessions for Study 2 attracted 122 children (1-12 years old) and adults. 53 people (2-39 years old) participated in the post-measure of Study 2. Results. Following feedback in Study 1, we added a frame cue and included a shuffle animation. This increased the percentage of correct practice trials from 76% to 97% (t(231)=14.29, p<.001). After adding a cardboard demo in Study 2, the percentage of correct trials remained stable but the number of additional instructions given decreased (t(103)=3.72, p<.001). Conclusions. Our study demonstrates impact of involvement of very young children in research through accessible activities. It can encourage researchers to involve young children and contribute to developing guidelines.","Casanova, T.; Black, C.; Rafiq, S.; Hugill, J.; Read, J. C.

157,"FDA oversight of NSIGHT genomic research: the need for an integrated systems approach to regulation","The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded the Newborn Sequencing In Genomic medicine and public HealTh (NSIGHT) Consortium to investigate the implications, challenges and opportunities associated with the possible use of genomic sequence information in the newborn period. Following announcement of the NSIGHT awardees in 2013, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) contacted investigators and requested that pre-submissions to investigational device exemptions (IDE) be submitted for the use of genomic sequencing under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR) part 812. IDE regulation permits clinical investigation of medical devices that have not been approved by the FDA. To our knowledge, this marked the first time the FDA determined that NIH-funded clinical genomic research projects are subject to IDE regulation. Here we review the history of and rationale behind FDA oversight of clinical research and the NSIGHT Consortiums experiences in navigating the IDE process. Overall, NSIGHT investigators found that FDAs application of existing IDE regulations and medical device definitions aligned imprecisely with the aims of publicly funded exploratory clinical research protocols. IDE risk assessments by the FDA were similar to, but distinct from, protocol risk assessments conducted by local Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), and had the potential to reflect novel oversight of emerging genomic technologies. However, the pre-IDE and IDE process delayed the start of NSIGHT research studies by an average of 10 months, and significantly limited the scope of investigation in two of the four NIH approved projects. Based on the experience of the NSIGHT Consortium, we conclude that policies and practices governing the development and use of novel genomic technologies in clinical research urgently need clarification in order to mitigate potentially conflicting or redundant oversight by IRBs, NIH, FDA, and state authorities.","Milko, L.

70,"Post-Exposure Effects of Vaccines on Infectious Diseases","Many available vaccines have demonstrated post-exposure effectiveness, but no published systematic reviews have synthesized these findings. We searched the PubMed database for clinical trials and observational human studies concerning the post-exposure vaccination effects, targeting infections with an FDA-licensed vaccine plus dengue, hepatitis E, malaria, and tick borne encephalitis, which have licensed vaccines outside of the U.S. Studies concerning animal models, serologic testing, and pipeline vaccines were excluded. Eligible studies were evaluated by definition of exposure, and their attempt at distinguishing pre- and post-exposure effects was rated on a scale of 1-4. We screened 4518 articles and ultimately identified 14 clinical trials and 31 observational studies for this review, amounting to 45 eligible articles spanning 7 of the 28 vaccine-preventable diseases. For secondary attack rate, this body of evidence found the following medians for post-exposure vaccination effectiveness: hepatitis A: 85% (IQR: 28; 5 sources), hepatitis B: 85% (IQR: 22; 5 sources), measles: 83% (IQR: 21; 8 sources), varicella: 67% (IQR: 48; 9 sources), smallpox: 45% (IQR: 39; 4 sources), and mumps: 38% (IQR: 7; 2 sources). For case fatality proportions resulting from rabies and smallpox, the vaccine efficacies had medians of 100% (IQR: 0; 6 sources) and 63% (IQR: 50; 8 sources) post-exposure. Although mainly used for preventive measures, many available vaccines can modify or preclude disease if administered after exposure. This post-exposure effectiveness could be important to consider during vaccine trials and while developing new vaccines.","Gallagher, T.

72,"The fecal microbiome in diverticulitis and asymptomatic diverticulosis: A case-control study in the US","Objective: The intestinal microbiota are hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of diverticulitis. We compared fecal microbial communities in individuals with diverticulitis to those with uncomplicated diverticulosis. Methods: We used 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing to assess and compare the microbiota composition of fecal samples from 10 patients presenting with acute diverticulitis (cases) and 10 controls with asymptomatic diverticulosis matched on age and sex. Results: We found differences in the distribution of relative abundances of bacterial phyla and genera in diverticulitis cases versus diverticulosis controls. At the phyla level, Verrucomicrobia was more abundant on average in diverticulitis cases at the time of diagnosis than in diverticulosis controls (p=0.07). Univariate analysis identified a significant increase in the genera Coriobacteria (p=0.050), Anaerotruncus (0.046), Subdoliganulum (p=0.034), Marvinabryantia (p=0.006), and Akkermansia (p=0.04), and a decrease in Barnesiella (p=0.035) and Coprococcus (p=0.035) in diverticulitis cases at the time of diagnosis compared to diverticulosis controls. However, after correction for multiple comparisons, these differences were no longer significant. Partial least squares discriminant analysis on all microbial genera showed partial separation of diverticulitis cases at diagnosis and diverticulosis controls. The microbial alpha diversity was higher in diverticulitis cases at time of diagnosis vs controls but this was not significant (Shannon diversity index 7.4{+/-}0.6 vs 6.8{+/-}0.7, p=0.08).

102,"Cardiac arrest outcomes after targeted temperature management with an esophageal cooling device","Objective: To assess the efficacy of an esophageal device to provide TTM (Target Temperature Management) post Cardiac Arrest. Design: A chart review of all patients treated with ETTM, following cardiac arrest. Initial patient temperature, time to target, supplemental methods (water blankets, head wraps, or ice packs), and patient survival were extracted for analysis. Setting: Community Medical Center Intensive Care Unit. Patients: All patients receiving TTM via an esophageal device post Cardiac Arrest from August 2016 to November 2018. Interventions: TTM both cooling and warming via an esophageal device. Measurements and Results: A total of 54 patients were treated from August 2016 to November 2018; 30 received ETM only, 22 received supplemental cooling, and 2 had treatment discontinued prior to reaching target due to recovery. Target temperatures ranged from 32 to 36 degrees. The median time to target temperature for the entire cohort was 219 minutes (IQR 81-415). For the cohorts without, and with, supplemental cooling modalities, the median time to attain target temperature was 128 minutes (IQR 71-334), and 285 minutes (IQR 204-660), respectively. Survival to ICU discharge was 51.9% for the entire cohort. Conclusions: ETM attains target temperature at a rate consistent with current guidelines and with similar performance to alternative modalities. This may provide a more cost-effective and approachable core cooling option to community hospitals that only use water blankets or other surface methods.","Wayne, M.

816,"Why so many significant Phase III results in clinical trials?","Planning and execution of clinical research and publication of results should conform to the highest ethical standards, given that human lives are at stake. However, economic incentives can generate conflicts of interest for investigators, who may be inclined to withhold unfavorable results or even tamper with the data. Analyzing p-values reported to the ClinicalTrials.gov registry with two different methodologies, we find suspicious patterns only for results from trials conducted by smaller industry sponsors, with presumably less reputation at stake. First, a density discontinuity test reveals an upward jump at the classical threshold for statistical significance for Phase 3 results by small industry sponsors, suggesting some selective reporting. Second, we find an excess mass of significant results in Phase 3 compared to Phase 2. However, we can explain almost completely this excess mass for large industry sponsors, once we account for the incentives to selectively continue research through a novel technique linking trials across phases. In contrast, for trials sponsored by small pharmaceutical companies, selective continuation of trials economizing on research costs only explains one third of the increase in the number of significant results from Phase 2 to Phase 3. The different pattern depending on the type of sponsor suggests that reputational concerns can mitigate the short-run economic incentives that undermine integrity in reporting results of clinical research.","Adda, J.; Decker, C.; Ottaviani, M.",20191125,"Health Economics","10.1101/19001495",2,"Marco Ottaviani","Bocconi University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001495v2?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001495v2.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"The study is based on publicly available data."
62,"Cluster analysis successfully identifies clinically meaningful knee valgus moment patterns: Frequency of early peaks reflects sex-specific ACL injury incidence","Background: Biomechanical studies of ACL injury risk factors report heterogenous results, analyze only a fraction of the data, and do not analyze data in accordance with the injury mechanism. Extracting a peak value of relevance to ACL injuries is challenging due to differences in the relative timing of the peak value. Aims/Hypotheses: The aim was to cluster analyze the knee valgus moment time series curve shape in the early stance phase. We hypothesized that 1a) There would be few discrete curve shapes, 1b) there would be an early peak pattern, 2a) youth athletes of both sexes would show similar frequencies of early peaks, 2b) adolescent girls would have higher early peak frequencies. Methods: N=213 (39% boys) youth soccer and team handball athletes (phase 1) and N=35 (45% boys) with 5 year follow-up data (phase 2) were recorded performing a change of direction task with 3D motion analysis and a force plate. The time series of the first 30% of stance phase were cluster analyzed based on Euclidean distances in two steps; shape-based main clusters with a transformed time series, and magnitude based sub-clusters with body weight normalized time series. Group differences (sex, phase) in curve shape frequencies, and shape-magnitude frequencies were tested with chi-squared test. Results: 6 discrete shape-clusters and 14 magnitude based sub-clusters were formed. Phase 1 boys had higher frequencies of early peaks than phase 1 girls (38% vs 25% respectively, P<0.001 for full test). Phase 2 girls had higher frequencies of early peaks than phase 2 boys (42% vs 21% respectively, P<0.001 for full test). Conclusions: Cluster analysis can reveal different patterns of curve shapes in biomechanical data. The early peak shape is relatable to the ACL injury mechanism as the timing of its peak moment is consistent with the timing of injury. Higher frequency of early peaks demonstrated by Phase 2 girls is consistent with their higher incidence of ACL injury.","Sigurthsson, H.

75,"Stem Cell Transplantation Patients and Situational Meaning: A Prospective and Longitudinal View","Background: Though there is thorough examination of psychosocial issues in SCT, there are few longitudinal studies examining the meaning SCT patients attribute to their treatment. Objective: The object of this study was to examine change in situational appraisal over time, and to explore potential modifiers of that change. Methods: A prospective, longitudinal study of 146 autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) patients at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) was conducted to measure situational appraisal over time as per the meaning making model of Park and Folkman (1997) utilizing the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised (IPQ-R; Moss-Morris et al., 2002). Participants were administered the instrument prior to transplant, at one, three and six months, and at one-year post-transplant. Results: Change over time was seen in different diagnoses, donor types, reduced intensity and standard pre-transplant preparative regimens, and between the two major ethnic groups (Caucasian and African American) studied. Many of the patient subgroups had statistically significant findings in measures of illness attribution. Conclusion: The appraisals SCT patients made of their situation in treatment revealed a complex process of appraisal affected by illness, treatment and patient characteristics including disease type, donor type, race, and pre-transplant regimen.","Blosser, J.; Sabo, R.; Candler, K.; Mullin, K.; Toor, A.; Chaber, D.",20190712,"Transplantation","10.1101/19001529",1,"Jennifer Blosser","VCU Health","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001529v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001529v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"data housed in Red Cap via Vanderbilt"
55,"Phenome-wide association study of TTR and RBP4 genes in 361,194 individuals reveals novel insights in the genetics of hereditary and senile systemic amyloidoses","Transthyretin (TTR) gene has a causal role in a hereditary form of amyloidosis (ATTRm) and is potentially involved in the risk of senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA). To understand the genetics of ATTRm and SSA, we conducted a phenome-wide association study of TTR gene in 361,194 participants of European descent testing coding and non-coding variants. Among the 382 clinically-relevant phenotypes tested, TTR non-coding variants were associated with 26 phenotypic traits after multiple testing correction. These included signs related to both ATTRm and SSA such as chronic ischaemic heart disease (rs140226130, p=2.00x10-6), heart failure (rs73956431, p=2.74x10-6), atrial fibrillation (rs10163755, p=4.63x10-6), dysphagia (rs2949506, p=3.95x10-6), intestine diseases (rs970866, p=7.14x10-6) and anxiety (rs554521234, p=8.85x10-6). Consistent results were observed for TTR disease-causing mutation Val122Ile (rs76992529) with respect to carpal tunnel syndrome (p=6.41x10-6) and mononeuropathies of upper limbs (p=1.22x10-5). Sex differences were also observed in line with ATTRm and SSA epidemiology. Additionally, we explored possible modifier genes related to TTR function, observing convergent associations of RBP4 variants with the clinical phenotypes associated with TTR locus. In conclusion, we provide novel insights regarding the molecular basis of ATTRm and SSA based on large-scale cohort, expanding our understanding of the phenotypic spectrum associated with TTR gene variation.","De Lillo, A.; De Angelis, F.; Di Girolamo, M.; Luigetti, M.; Frusconi, S.; Manfellotto, D.; Fuciarelli, M.; Polimanti, R.",20190708,"Genetic And Genomic Medicine","10.1101/19001537",1,"Renato Polimanti","Yale University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001537v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001537v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"All data generated during this study are included in this published article and its Supplemental information files"
100,"Bayesian spatial modelling of childhood cancer incidence in Switzerland using exact point data: A nationwide study during 1985-2015.","Background: The aetiology of most childhood cancers is largely unknown. Spatially varying environmental factors such as traffic-related air pollution, background radiation and agricultural pesticides might contribute to the development of childhood cancer. We investigated the spatial variation of childhood cancers in Switzerland using exact geocodes of place of residence. Methods: We included 5,947 children diagnosed with cancer during 1985-2015 at age 0-15 from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry. We modelled cancer risk using log-Gaussian Cox processes and indirect standardization to adjust for age and year of diagnosis. We examined whether the modelled spatial variation of risk can be explained by ambient air concentration of NO2, natural background radiation, area-based socio-economic position (SEP), linguistic region, years of existing general cancer registration in the canton or degree of urbanization. Results: For all childhood cancers combined, the posterior median relative risk (RR), compared to the national level, varied by location from 0.83 to 1.13 (min to max). Corresponding ranges were 0.96 to 1.09 for leukaemia, 0.90 to 1.13 for lymphoma, and 0.82 to 1.23 for CNS tumours. The covariates considered explained 72% of the observed spatial variation for all cancers, 81% for leukaemia, 82% for lymphoma and 64% for CNS tumours. There was evidence of an association of background radiation and SEP with incidence of CNS tumours, (1.19;0.98-1.40) and (1.6;1-1.13) respectively. Conclusion: Of the investigated diagnostic groups, childhood CNS tumours show the largest spatial variation in Switzerland. The selected covariates only partially explained the observed variation of CNS tumours suggesting that other environmental factors also play a role.","Konstantinoudis, G.; Schuhmacher, D.; Ammann, R.; Diesch, T.; Kuehni, C.; Spycher, B.

99,"Public knowledge and attitude towards epilepsy and its associated factors in Debre Berhan, North Shoa, Amhara Region, Ethiopia, 2018/19. Community based cross sectional study","Introduction: Epilepsy is chronic brain disorder characterized by recurrent derangement of the nervous system due to sudden excessive disorderly discharge of the cerebral neurons. People living with epilepsy continue to suffer from enacted or perceived stigma that is based on myths, misconceptions, and misunderstandings that have persisted for many years. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the community general knowledge and attitude towards epilepsy. Methods: Community based cross sectional study was conducted to assess public general knowledge and attitude towards epilepsy and its associated factors using structured pretested questionnaire. Data was entered into Epi data version 3.1 and transported to SPSS version 21 further analysis. Both Bivariable and Multivariable Logistic Regression was done to identify associated factors. Odds Ratios and their 95% Confidence interval was computed and variables with p value less than 0.05 was considered significantly associated factors. Results: 596 study participants were participated with a response rate of 98%. Among the study participants 43.6 (95% CI: 39.6, 47.5) had poor knowledge and 41.3 (95% CI: 37.4, 45.1) had unfavorable attitude. Being secondary education, marital status, witnessed seizure, and heard the term epilepsy were showed statistically significant association with poor knowledge about epilepsy. Level of education, low average monthly income, not witnessed seizure, not heard the term epilepsy and distant from health facility showed statically significant association with the unfavorable attitude. Conclusion: In this study, Debre Berhan communities were found to have deficits in terms of general knowledge and attitude about epilepsy; and it should be given due attention.","Dargie, A.

MethodsWe conducted a prospective, randomized and controlled clinical trial of 288 patients undergoing radial artery cannulation. Patients were randomized 1:1 to M-LAINUT or C-PT group at fujian medical university union hospital between 2017 and 2018. Radial artery cannulation was performed by three anesthesiologists with different experience. The outcome was the first and total radial artery cannulation success rates, the number of attempts and the cannulation time. Results: 285 patients were statistically analyzed. The success rate of first attempt was 91.6% in the M-LAINUT group (n=143) and 57.7% in the C-PT group (n=142; P<0.001) (odds ratio, 7.9; 95% confidence interval, 4.0-15.7). The total success rate ([&le;]5 min and [&le;]3 attempts) in the M-LAINUT group was 97.9%, compared to 84.5% in the palpation group (p <0.001) (odds ratio, 8.5; 95% confidence interval, 2.5-29.2). The total cannulation time was shorter and the number of attempts was fewer in the M-LAINUT group than that in the C-PT group (p <0. 05). Conclusion: Modified long-axis in-plane ultrasound-guided radial artery cannulation can increase the first and total radial artery cannulation success rates, reduce the number of attempts and shorten the total cannulation time in adults.","Wang, J.; Lai, Z.; Weng, X.; Lin, Y.; Wu, G.; Huang, Q.; Su, J.; Zeng, J.; Liu, J.; Zhao, Z.; Yan, T.; Zhang,, L.; Zhou, L.",20190720,"Anesthesia","10.1101/19001586",1,"Liangcheng Zhang,","Department of Anesthesiology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, No.29 Xin-Quan Road, Fuzhou, 350001, China","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001586v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001586v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd","10.1097/MD.0000000000018747","The data used to support the findings of this study are included within the article."

To characterize changes in the plasma metabolic profile in newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients upon commencement of conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (cDMARD) therapy. Methods. Plasma samples collected in an early RA randomized strategy study (NCT00920478) that compared clinical (DAS) disease activity assessment with musculoskeletal ultrasound assessment (MSUS) to drive treatment decisions were subjected to untargeted metabolomic analysis. Metabolic profiles were collected at pre- and 3 months post commencement of non-biologic cDMARD. Metabolites that changed in association with changes in the DAS44 score were identified at the 3 month timepoint. Results. A total of ten metabolites exhibited a clear correlation with reduction in DAS44 score following cDMARD commencement, particularly itaconate, its derived anhydride and a derivative of itaconate coA. Increasing itaconate correlated with improved DAS44 score and decreasing levels of CRP. Conclusion. cDMARD treatment effects invoke consistent changes in plasma detectable metabolites, that in turn implicate clinical disease activity with macrophages. Such changes inform RA pathogenesis and reveal for the first time a link between itaconate production and resolution of an inflammatory disease in humans. Quantitative metabolic biomarker based tests of clinical change in state are feasible and should be developed around the itaconate pathway.","Daly, R.; Blackburn, G.; Mudaliar, M.; Burgess, K.; Stirling, A.; Porter, D.; Mcinnes, I.; Barrett, M.

60,"Impact of a regional educational advertising campaign on harm perceptions of e-cigarettes, prevalence of e-cigarette use, and quit attempts among smokers","Background: We evaluated how effective an advertising campaign that was piloted by Cancer Research UK in January/February 2018 was at promoting quit attempts by increasing awareness of the relative harms of e-cigarettes compared with smoking. Methods: Adults ([&ge;]16 years, n = 2217) living in Greater Manchester (campaign region) and Yorkshire & Humber and the North East of England (control regions) completed cross-sectional surveys immediately before and after the campaign period. Surveys measured socio-demographics, perceptions and use of e-cigarettes, and motivation and attempts to quit smoking. We tested interactions between time (pre, post) and region (campaign, control). Results: 36.7% (95% CI 33.0% - 40.6%) of those in the intervention region recognised the campaign. In the general population, interactions were non-significant for all outcomes except for perception of e-cigarettes as effective cessation aids, with smaller increases from pre- to post-campaign in the campaign (49.9% to 54.0%) compared with the control region (40.5% to 55.0%; OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.45 - 0.98). Among smokers, motivation to quit increased in the intervention region (44.0% to 48.0%) but decreased in the control region (40.5% to 21.5%; OR = 2.97, 95% CI 1.25 - 7.16), with no other significant differences between regions over time. A Bayesian analysis confirmed that non-significant results were inconclusive. Conclusions: Compared with the control region, the campaign was associated with an increase in smokers' motivation to quit but a smaller increase in adults' perception of e-cigarettes as an effective cessation aid. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether the campaign affected other outcomes.","Tattan-Birch, H.; Jackson, S.

118,"Sitagliptin decreases visceral fat and blood glucose in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome","Context: Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) have decreased growth hormone (GH), which can increase visceral adiposity (VAT) and impair vascular function. GH releasing hormone, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) substrate, stimulates GH secretion. Objective: We tested the hypothesis that DPP4 inhibition increases GH and improves glucose levels and vascular function in women with PCOS. Methods: Eighteen women with PCOS participated in a double-blinded, cross-over study. They received sitagliptin 100 mg vs. placebo daily for one month separated by an eight-week washout. During each treatment, women underwent a 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), assessment of vascular function and body composition. Overnight GH secretion was assessed via venous sampling every 10 minutes for 12 hours and analyzed using an automated deconvolution algorithm. Results: During OGTT, sitagliptin increased GLP-1 (p<0.001), early insulin secretion (from mean insulinogenic index 1.9{+/-}1.2 (SD) to 3.2{+/-} 3.1; p=0.02) and decreased peak glucose (mean -17.2 mg/dL [95% CI -27.7, -6.6]; p<0.01). At one month, sitagliptin decreased VAT (from 1141.9{+/-}700.7 to 1055.1{+/-}710.1 g; p=0.02) but did not affect vascular function. Sitagliptin increased GH half-life (from 13.9{+/-}3.6 to 17.0{+/-}6.8 min, N=16; p=0.04) and interpulse interval (from 53.2{+/-}20.0 to 77.3{+/-}38.2 min, N=16; p<0.05) but did not increase mean overnight GH (p=0.92 vs. placebo). Conclusions: Sitagliptin decreased the maximal glucose response to OGTT and VAT. Sitagliptin did not increase overnight GH but increased GH half-life and the interpulse interval. Precis: Sitagliptin improved body composition and blood glucoses following oral glucose load in women with PCOS. Sitagliptin potentiated GH half-life but did not increase overnight GH levels.","Devin, J. K.; Wright, P.; Celedonio, J. E.; Nian, H.; Brown, N.

973,"Automated interpretation of the coronary angioscopy with deep convolutional neural networks","Background: Coronary angioscopy (CAS) is a useful modality to assess atherosclerotic changes, but interpretation of the images requires expert knowledge. Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) can be used for diagnostic prediction and image synthesis. Methods: 107 images from 47 patients, who underwent coronary angioscopy in our hospital between 2014 and 2017, and 864 images, selected from 142 MEDLINE-indexed articles published between 2000 and 2019, were analyzed. First, we developed a prediction model for the angioscopic findings. Next, we made a generative adversarial networks (GAN) model to simulate the CAS images. Finally, we tried to control the output images according to the angioscopic findings with conditional GAN architecture. Results: For both yellow color (YC) grade and neointimal coverage (NC) grade, we could observe strong correlations between the true grades and the predicted values (YC grade, average r value = 0.80 {+/-} 0.02, p-value <0.001; NC grade, average r value = 0.73 {+/-} 0.02, p < 0.001). The binary classification model for the red thrombus yielded 0.71 {+/-} 0.03 F1- score and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.91 {+/-} 0.02.

1003,"The relationship between antihypertensive medications and mood disorders: analysis of linked healthcare data for 1.8 million patients.","Background: Recent work suggests that antihypertensive medications may be useful as repurposed treatments for mood disorders. Using large-scale linked healthcare data we investigated whether certain classes of antihypertensive, such as angiotensin antagonists and calcium channel blockers, were associated with reduced risk of new-onset Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder. Method: Two cohorts of patients treated with antihypertensives were identified from Scottish prescribing (2009-2016) and hospital admission (1981-2016) records. Eligibility for cohort membership was determined by receipt of a minimum of four prescriptions for antihypertensives within a 12-month window. One treatment cohort (n=538,730) included patients with no previous history of mood disorder, whereas the other (n=262,278) included those who did. Both cohorts were matched by age, sex and area deprivation to untreated comparators. Associations between antihypertensive treatment and new-onset MDD or bipolar episodes were investigated using Cox regression. Results: For patients without a history of mood disorder, antihypertensives were associated with increased risk of new-onset MDD. For angiotensin antagonist monotherapy, the hazard ratio (HR) for new-onset MDD was 1.17 (95%CI 1.04-1.31). Beta blockers' association was stronger (HR 2.68; 95%CI 2.45-2.92), possibly indicating pre-existing anxiety. Some classes of antihypertensive were associated with protection against bipolar disorder, particularly angiotensin antagonists (HR 0.46; 95%CI 0.30-0.70). For patients with a past history of mood disorders, all classes of antihypertensives were associated with increased risk of future episodes of MDD. Conclusions: There was no evidence that antihypertensive medications prevented new episodes of MDD but angiotensin antagonists may represent a novel treatment avenue for bipolar disorder.","Shaw, R.

198,"Transcriptional survey of peripheral blood links lower oxygen saturation during sleep with reduced expressions of CD1D and RAB20 that is reversed by CPAP therapy","Sleep Disordered Breathing (SDB) is associated with a wide range of physiological changes due, in part, to the influence of hypoxemia during sleep. We studied gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in association with three measures of SDB: Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI); average oxyhemoglobin saturation (avgO2) during sleep; and minimum oxyhemoglobin saturation (minO2) during sleep. We performed discovery association analysis in two community-based studies, the Framingham Offspring Study (FOS; N=571) and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA; N = 580). An association with false discovery rate (FDR) q < 0.05 in one study was considered replicated if a p < 0.05 was observed in the other study. Those genes that replicated across MESA and FOS, or with FDR q < 0.05 in meta-analysis, were used for analysis of gene expression in the blood of 15 participants from the Heart Biomarkers In Apnea Treatment (HeartBEAT) trial. HeartBEAT participants had moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and were studied pre- and post-treatment (three months) with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). We also performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on all traits and cohort analyses. Twenty-two genes were associated with SDB traits in both MESA and FOS. Of these, lower expression of CD1D and RAB20 was associated with lower avgO2 in MESA and FOS. CPAP treatment increased the expression of these genes in HeartBEAT participants. Immunity and inflammation pathways were up-regulated in subjects with lower avgO2; i.e., in those with a more severe SDB phenotype (MESA), whereas immuno-inflammatory processes were down-regulated in response to CPAP treatment (HeartBEAT).","Sofer, T.; Li, R.; Joehanes, R.; Lin, H.; Gower, A.

146,"A single-blinded randomized crossover trial comparing peer-to-peer and standard instruction on airway management skill training","Background Peer-to-peer teaching, which is an alternative to standard teaching (by expert instructors), has the potential to emphasize student self-learning and reduce the cost and workload of the instructor. Self-instruction videos with peer feedback are highlighted in many medical and nursing school curricula. Objective To evaluate whether peer to peer instruction supported by a structured curriculum and video exemplars is not inferior to standard instructor-led teaching in basic airway management skill, knowledge, and confidence attainment. Method This single blinded randomized crossover trial was conducted with a sample of novice nursing students. Data was collected through the pre- to post- knowledge and confidence assessments. The students were randomly assigned to two crossover groups. Each student learned basic airway management skills through both methods. The students performances were recorded in every session with recordings reviewed by blinded expert instructors. Results The study included 48 participants, who were assigned into both the expert instruction group and peer-to-peer group through computer generated randomization. The skill rating scores of the peer-to-peer group were not inferior to the standard teaching. With further analysis, we noted that the peer-to-peer group scores had significantly higher scores demonstrating a large effect size (Cohens d of 1.07 (p-value 0.002) for oropharyngeal airway insertion, 1.14 (p-value <0.001) for nasopharyngeal airway insertion and 0.81 (p-value 0.003) for bag mask ventilation). There was no significant difference between pre- and post- knowledge scores across groups (p-value of 0.13 and 0.22 respectively). Participants in both groups reported higher confidence after learning. However, the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions Undergraduate nursing students trained in basic airway management skills by peer-to-peer instruction and a structured curriculum did not show inferior scores compared to the students who were trained by expert instructors. There was no significant difference in the knowledge and confidence levels between the groups.","Surabenjawong, U.; Phrampus, P.

92,"Pain in clients attending a South African voluntary counselling and testing centre was frequent and extensive but did not depend on HIV status.","Background: The frequency of pain is reported to be high in people living with HIV (PLWH), but valid comparisons between PLWH and HIV-negative cohorts are rare. We investigated whether HIV infection influenced frequency and characteristics of pain in adults undergoing voluntary testing for HIV. Methods: Participants were recruited from a HIV voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) centre at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital, Soweto, South Africa. Pain was assessed using the Wisconsin Brief Pain Questionnaire. Depressive and anxiety symptomatology was determined using the Hopkins Symptom checklist-25. We then stratified by HIV status. Results: Data from 535 black South Africans were analysed: HIV-infected n=70, HIV uninfected n=465. Overall, frequency of pain was high with 59% (95%CI: 55; 63, n: 316/535) of participants reporting pain, with no difference related to HIV status: HIV-infected 50% (95% CI: 37; 61, n: 35/70), HIV-uninfected 60% (95%CI: 56; 65, n: 281/465). Pain intensity and number of pain sites were similar between the groups as were symptoms of anxiety and depression: mean HSCL-25 1.72 (95% CI 1.57; 1.87) HIV-infected participants and 1.68 (95% CI: 1.63; 1.73) HIV-uninfected participants. Univariate analysis showed female sex and greater depressive and anxiety symptomatology associated with having pain. In a conservative multivariable model, only depressive and anxiety symptomatology was retained in the model. Conclusion: The high frequency of pain found in both HIV infected and uninfected individuals presenting at a VCT centre was more likely to be associated with depression and anxiety, than with the presence or absence of HIV.","Wadley, A.

79,"Design of a computer model for the identification of adolescent swimmers with low BMD","Objectives: This paper aims to elaborate a decision tree for the early detection of adolescent swimmers at risk of presenting low bone mineral density (BMD), based on easily measurable fitness and performance variables. Methods: Bone mineral status of 78 adolescent swimmers was determined using DXA scans at the hip and subtotal body. Participants also underwent physical fitness (upper and lower body strength, running speed and cardiovascular endurance) and performance (swimming history, speed and ranking) assessments. A gradient boosting machine regression tree was built in order to predict BMD of the swimmers and to further develop a simpler individual decision tree, using a subtotal BMD height-adjusted Z-score of -1 as threshold value. Results: The predicted BMD using the gradient boosted model was strongly correlated with the actual BMD values obtained from DXA (r=0.960, p<0.0001) with a root mean squared error of 0.034 g/cm2. According to a simple decision tree, that showed a 73.9% of classification accuracy, swimmers with a body mass index (BMI) lower than 17 kg/m2 or a handgrip strength inferior to 43kg with the sum of both arms could be at higher risk of having low BMD. Conclusion: Easily measurable fitness variables (BMI and handgrip strength) could be used for the early detection of adolescent swimmers at risk of suffering from low BMD. The presented decision tree could be used in training settings to determine the necessity of further BMD assessments.","Marin-Puyalto, J.; Gomez-Cabello, A.; Gomez-Bruton, A.; Matute-Llorente, A.; Gonzalez-Aguero, A.; Casajus, J.

406,"Childhood immune imprinting to influenza A shapes birth year-specific risk during seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 epidemics","Across decades of co-circulation in humans, influenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 have caused seasonal epidemics characterized by different age distributions of cases and mortality. H3N2 causes the majority of relatively severe, clinically attended cases in high-risk elderly cohorts, and the majority of overall deaths, whereas H1N1 causes fewer deaths overall, and cases shifted towards young and middle-aged adults. These contrasting age profiles may result from differences in childhood exposure to H1N1 and H3N2 or from differences in evolutionary rate between subtypes. Here we analyze a large epidemiological surveillance dataset to test whether childhood immune imprinting shapes seasonal influenza epidemiology, and if so, whether it acts primarily via immune memory of a particular influenza subtype or via broader immune memory that protects across subtypes. We also test the impact of evolutionary differences between influenza subtypes on age distributions of cases. Likelihood-based model comparison shows that narrow, within-subtype imprinting shapes seasonal influenza risk alongside age-specific risk factors. The data do not support a strong effect of evolutionary rate, or of broadly protective imprinting that acts across subtypes. Our findings emphasize that childhood exposures can imprint a lifelong immunological bias toward particular influenza subtypes, and that these cohort-specific biases shape epidemic age distributions. As a result, newer and less ""senior"" antibody responses acquired later in life do not provide the same strength of protection as responses imprinted in childhood. Finally, we project that the relatively low mortality burden of H1N1 may increase in the coming decades, as cohorts that lack H1N1-specific imprinting eventually reach old age.","Gostic, K.

83,"Effects of vitamin D supplementation and seasonality on circulating cytokines in adolescents: analysis of data from a feasibility trial in Mongolia.","Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in human populations and has been linked to immune dysfunction. Here we explored the effects of cholecalciferol supplementation on circulating cytokines in severely vitamin D deficient (blood 25(OH)D3 << 30 nmol/L) adolescents aged 12-15 from Mongolia. The study included 28 children receiving 800 IU daily cholecalciferol for 6 months spanning winter and spring, and 30 children receiving placebo during the same period. The levels of 25(OH)D3 were assessed at baseline, three and six months. Twenty-one cytokines were measured in serum at baseline and at six months. The median blood 25(OH)D3 concentration at baseline was 13.7 nmol/L (IQR=10.0-21.7). Supplementation tripled blood 25(OH)D3 levels (p<0.001) and reversed the direction of change for most cytokines (16/21, 86%). Supplementation was associated with elevated interleukin (IL)-6 (p=0.043). The placebo group had reduced MIP-1 (p=0.007) and IL-8 (p=0.034) at six months. These findings suggest that cholecalciferol supplementation and seasonality have a measurable impact on circulating cytokines in adolescents, identifying chemokines as potentially important biomarkers of vitamin D status in this population.","Yegorov, S.; Bromage, S.; Boldbaatar, N.; Ganmaa, D.",20190714,"Nutrition","10.1101/19001842",1,"Sergey Yegorov","Suleyman Demirel University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001842v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001842v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd","10.3389/fnut.2019.00166","All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this published article."

However, these resources may not adequately reveal pharmaceutical-author interactions and their potential conflicts of interest (CoIs). This investigation: 1) evaluated the correspondence of two well-utilized CoI databases: the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Open Payments (CMSOP) and ProPublica Dollars for Docs (PDD) and 2) quantified CoIs among authors of a publically available point of care clinical support website. Two data sources were used: the hundred most common drugs and the top fifty causes of death. These topics were entered into a freely available database. The authors (N = 139) were then input into CMSOP and PDD and compensation and number of payment were determined for 2013-2015. The subset of highly compensated authors that also reported quote: Nothing to disclose, unquote, were further examined. There was a high degree of similarity between CMSOP and PDD for compensation (R2 > 0.998) and payment number (R2 > 0.992). The amount received was 1.4% higher in CMSOP ($4,059,194) than in PDD ($4,002,891). The articles where the authors had received the greatest compensation were in neurology (Parkinsons Disease = $1,810,032), oncology (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia = $616,727), and endocrinology (Type I Diabetes = $377,388). Two authors reporting Nothing to disclose received appreciable and potentially relevant compensation. CMSOP and PDD produced almost identical results. CoIs were common among authors but self-reporting may be an inadequate reporting mechanism.

81,"Actigraphic Screening for Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder","Background: The patients suffering of the rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) are in high risk of developing a neurodegenerative disorder, most frequently from the group of alpha-synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) or multiple system atrophy (MSA). The definitive diagnosis of RBD is based on polysomnographic investigation. Actigraphy is much easier to perform and reflects condition in patient's home environment. The aims: The aim of this study was to find suitable biomarkers for RBD, which can be detectable by actigraphic recording. Methods: High resolution actigraphic recording (MotionWatch, CamNtech ltd.) and confirming polysomnographic recording was performed on 45 RBD patients, 30 patients with other sleep-related motor disorders and 20 healthy controls. Each individual file was analysed by software testing for amount of sleep (MotionWare 1.1.20) and secondly for periodic motor activity (PLMS analysis 1.0.16). The 13-item patient self-rating RBD screening questionnaire (RBD-SQ) translated to Czech language was also used for screening purposes. We used an RBD-SQ score of five points as a positive test result, as suggested by the original publication of the scale. Results: When using the actigraphic sleep detection, we encountered significant differences mostly on non-dominant hand, related to sleep fragmentation - most notably increased percentage of Short immobile bouts (47.0% vs. 28.0%, p<0.0001), increased Fragmentation index (72.5 vs. 40.7, p<0.0001) and decreased percentage of Sleep efficiency (72.1% vs. 86.8%, p<0.0001)in RBD subjects compared to other sleep disorders and controls. When analyzing periodic motor activity, we also found surprisingly more periodic hand movements (p=0.028, corrected for multiple testing), but differences on lower extremities using either measurement were not significant. The discrimination function based on RBD-SQ and Short immobile bouts % could allocate correctly the RBD status in 87.6% of cases with Wilks Lambda 0.435 and p<0.0001. Conclusion: In our single-center study in patients from the Czech population, we found that actigraphic recording from upper extremities shows consistently more prominent sleep fragmentation in RBD patients compared to other sleep diagnoses or healthy controls. Actigraphy may be useful in broader screening for RBD.","Sandala, K.; Dostalova, S.; Nepozitek, J.; Ibarburu, V.; Dusek, P.; Ruzicka, E.; Sonka, K.; Kemlink, D.",20190714,"Neurology","10.1101/19001867",1,"David Kemlink","First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001867v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001867v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"The datasets used and analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request"
302,"Earliest infections predict the age distribution of seasonal influenza A cases","Seasonal variation in the age distribution of influenza A cases suggests that factors other than age shape susceptibility to medically attended infection. We ask whether these differences can be partly explained by protection conferred by childhood influenza infection, which has lasting impacts on immune responses to influenza and protection against new influenza A subtypes (phenomena known as original antigenic sin and immune imprinting). Fitting a statistical model to data from studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE), we find that primary infection appears to reduce the risk of medically attended infection with that subtype throughout life. This effect is stronger for H1N1 compared to H3N2. Additionally, we find evidence that VE varies with both age and birth year, suggesting that VE is sensitive to early exposures. Our findings may improve estimates of age-specific risk and VE in similarly vaccinated populations and thus improve forecasting and vaccination strategies to combat seasonal influenza.","Arevalo, P.; Mclean, H.

DESIGN: Pregnancy cohort SETTING: Population-based, nation-wide study in Norway PARTICIPANTS: 86,306 children in The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study born from 1999 through 2009, followed to April 15, 2018. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical type 1 diabetes, ascertained in a nation-wide childhood diabetes registry. Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox regression for the exposures maternal gluten intake up to week 22 of pregnancy and child's gluten intake when the child was 18 months old. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 12.3 years (range 0.7-16.0), 346 children (0.4%) developed type 1 diabetes (incidence rate 32.6 per 100,000 person-years). The average gluten intake was 13.6 grams/day for mothers during pregnancy, and 8.8 grams/day for the child at 18 months of age. Maternal gluten intake in mid-pregnancy was not associated with the development of type 1 diabetes in the child (adjusted hazard ratio 1.02 (95% confidence interval 0.73 to 1.43) per 10 grams/day increase in gluten intake). However, the child's gluten intake at 18 months of age was associated with an increased risk of later developing type 1 diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio 1.46 (95% confidence interval 1.06 to 2.01) per 10 grams/day increase in gluten intake). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the child's gluten intake at 18 months of age, and not the maternal intake during pregnancy, could increase the risk of type 1 diabetes in the child.","Lund-Blix, N.

254,"Mediterranean Diet improves thrombosis biomarkers in high cardiovascular risk individuals: a randomized controlled trial","Following a Traditional Mediterranean diet (TMD) decreases cardiovascular risk. However, its anti-thrombotic effects are unexplored. We aimed to assess whether this diet improved platelet, coagulation, and fibrinolysis-related biomarkers in cardiovascular risk subjects. In 358 random PREDIMED Study volunteers (Prevencion con Dieta Mediterranea), we assessed: 1) 1-year effects on thrombosis of TMD, enriched in virgin olive oil (TMD-VOO; N=120) or nuts (TMD-Nuts; N=119), versus a low-fat diet (N=119), and 2) associations between 1-year biomarker changes and increments in Mediterranean Diet adherence and key food group intakes. TMD-Nuts attenuated pro-thrombotic status (P=0.029), whilst TMD-VOO did it in a marginally significant way (P=0.076). TMD-VOO decreased HDL-bound alpha1-antitrypsin levels (HDL pro-inflammatory/pro-thrombotic properties, P=0.034) and increased HDL platelet activating factor-acetylhydrolase activity (P=0.024). TMD-Nuts diminished non-esterified fatty acid levels (P=0.034). Only the low-fat diet was associated with increased platelet factor-4 concentrations (P=0.012) and thrombin activation (higher prothrombin factor1+2 levels, P=0.003) versus baseline. 2-point TMD adherence increments were linked to 10.2 mg/dL fibrinogen decrements (P=0.011). 1-serving increments in vegetable intake were associated with platelet factor-4 concentration decreases (-9.21%, P=0.031). 1-portion increments in fruit and fatty fish consumption were linked to thrombin generation decrements (-7.72% -P=0.007- and -13.2% -P=0.046-, respectively). Increases in antithrombin levels were related to 1-serving increments in nut intake (+2.34%, P=0.033) and reductions in processed meat consumption (+2.00%, P=0.018).

84,"Reproducibility and transparency characteristics of oncology research evidence","Introduction: As much as 50%-90% of research is estimated to be irreproducible, costing upwards of $28 billion in the United States alone. Reproducible research practices are essential to improving the reproducibility and transparency of biomedical research, such as including pre-registering studies, publishing a protocol, making research data and metadata publicly available, and publishing in open access journals. Here we report an investigation of key reproducible or transparent research practices in the published oncology literature. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of a random sample of 300 oncology studies published from 2014-2018. We extracted key reproducibility and transparency characteristics in a duplicative fashion by blinded investigators using a pilot tested Google Form. Results: Of the 300 studies randomly sampled, 296 studies were analyzed for study reproducibility characteristics. Of these 296 studies, 194 were contained empirical data that could be analyzed for reproducible and transparent research practices. Raw data was available for 9 studies (4.6%). Approximately 5 studies (2.6%) provided a protocol. Despite our sample including 15 clinical trials and 7 systematic reviews/meta-analyses, only 7 included a pre-registration statement. Less than 25% (65/194) of studies provided an author conflict of interest statement. Discussion: We found that key reproducibility and transparency characteristics were absent from a random sample of published oncology studies. We recommend required pre-registration for all eligible trials and systematic reviews, published protocols for all manuscripts, and deposition of raw data and metadata in public repositories.","Walters, C.

76,"Prediagnostic breast milk DNA methylation alterations in women who develop breast cancer","Background: Prior candidate gene studies have shown tumor suppressor DNA methylation in breast milk related with history of breast biopsy, an established risk factor for breast cancer. To further establish the utility of breast milk as a tissue-specific biospecimen for investigations of breast carcinogenesis we measured genome-wide DNA methylation in breast milk from women with and without a diagnosis of breast cancer in two independent cohorts. Methods: DNA methylation was assessed using Illumina HumanMethylation450k in 87 breast milk samples. After quality control, 368,171 autosomal CpG loci were analyzed. Cell type proportion estimates from RefFreeCellMix were calculated and adjusted for in this Epigenome Wide Association Study using linear mixed effects models adjusted for history of breast biopsy, age, time of delivery, cell type proportion estimates, array chip, and subject as random effect. Results: Epigenome-wide analyses identified 58 differentially methylated CpG sites associated with a breast cancer diagnosis in the prospectively collected milk samples from the breast that would develop cancer compared with women without a diagnosis of breast cancer (q-value < 0.05). Nearly all CpG sites associated with a breast cancer diagnosis were hypomethylated in cases compared with controls, and were enriched for CpG islands. In addition, inferred repeat element methylation was lower in breast milk DNA from cases compared to controls, and cases exhibited increased estimated epigenetic mitotic tick rate as well as DNA methylation age compared with controls. Conclusion: Breast milk has utility as a biospecimen for prospective assessment of disease risk, for understanding the underlying molecular basis of breast cancer risk factors, and improving primary and secondary prevention of breast cancer.","Salas, L.

85,"Redefining typhoid diagnosis: what would an improved test need to look like?","Introduction: Typhoid fever is one of the most common bacterial causes of acute febrile illness in the developing world, with an estimated 10.9 million new cases and 116.8 thousand deaths in 2017. Typhoid point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tests are widely used but have poor sensitivity and specificity, resulting in antibiotic overuse that has led to the emergence and spread of multidrug resistant strains. With recent advances in typhoid surveillance and detection, this is the ideal time to produce a target product profile (TPP) that guides product development and ensure that a next-generation test meets the needs of users in the resource-limited settings where typhoid is endemic. Methods: A structured literature review was conducted to develop a draft TPP for a next-generation typhoid diagnostic test with minimal and optimal desired characteristics for 36 test parameters. The TPP was refined using feedback collected from a Delphi survey of key stakeholders in clinical medicine, microbiology, diagnostics and public and global health. Results: A next-generation typhoid diagnostic test should improve patient management through the diagnosis and treatment of infection with acute Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi or Paratyphi with a sensitivity [&ge;]90% and specificity [&ge;]95%. The test would ideally be used at the lowest level of the healthcare system in settings without a reliable power or water supply and provide results in less than 15 minutes at a cost of <$1.00 USD. Conclusion: This report outlines the first comprehensive TPP for typhoid fever and is intended to guide the development of a next-generation typhoid diagnostic test. An accurate POC test will reduce the morbidity and mortality of typhoid fever through rapid diagnosis and treatment and will have the greatest impact in reducing antimicrobial resistance if it is combined with diagnostics for other causes of acute febrile illness in a treatment algorithm.","Mather, R.; Hopkins, H.; Parry, C.; Dittrich, S.",20190714,"Infectious Diseases","10.1101/19001958",1,"Richard Mather","London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001958v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001958v1.full.pdf","cc_by","10.1136/bmjgh-2019-001831","All data can be made available."
71,"Epigenetic field cancerization in breast cancer using subject-matched tumor, ipsilateral-normal, and contralateral-normal tissues","Background: Emerging work has demonstrated that histologically normal (non-tumor) tissue adjacent to breast tumor tissue shows evidence of molecular alterations related to tumorigenesis, referred to as field cancerization effects. Although changes in DNA methylation are known to occur early in breast carcinogenesis and the landscape of breast tumor DNA methylation is profoundly altered compared with normal tissue, there have been limited efforts to identify DNA methylation field cancerization effects in histologically normal breast tissue adjacent to tumor. Methods: Matched tumor, histologically normal tissue of the ipsilateral breast (ipsilateral-normal), and histologically normal tissue of the contralateral breast (contralateral-normal) were obtained from nine women undergoing bilateral mastectomy. Laser capture microdissection was used to select breast epithelial cells from normal tissues, and neoplastic cells from tumor specimens for genome-scale measures of DNA methylation with the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC array. Results: We identified substantially more CpG loci that were differentially methylated between contralateral-normal breast and tumor tissue (63,271 CpG loci q < 0.01), than between ipsilateral-normal tissue and tumor (38,346 CpG loci q < 0.01). In addition, we identified differential methylation in ipsilateral-normal relative to contralateral-normal tissue (9,562 CpG loci p < 0.01). Hypomethylated loci in ipsilateral normal relative to contralateral were significantly enriched for breast cancer-relevant transcription factor binding sites including those for ESR1, FoxA1, and GATA3. Hypermethylated loci in ipsilateral-normal relative to contralateral-normal tissue were significantly enriched for CpG island shore regions. Conclusions: Our results indicate that early hypermethylation events in breast carcinogenesis are more likely to occur in the regions immediately surrounding CpG islands than CpG islands per se, reflecting a field effect of the tumor on surrounding histologically normal tissue. This work offers an opportunity to focus investigations of early DNA methylation alterations in breast carcinogenesis and potentially develop epigenetic biomarkers of disease risk.","Muse, M.

These disorders are influenced by multiple risk factors, from genes to psychological vulnerabilities and environmental stressors but research is hampered by a lack of sufficiently large comprehensive studies. We are recruiting 40,000 individuals with lifetime depression or anxiety, with broad assessment of risks to facilitate future research. Methods: The Genetic Links to Anxiety and Depression (GLAD) Study (www.gladstudy.org.uk) recruits individuals with depression or anxiety into the NIHR Mental Health BioResource. Participants invited to join the study (via media campaigns) provide demographic, environmental and genetic data, and consent for medical record linkage and recontact. Results: Online recruitment was effective; 41,892 consented and 26,877 participants completed the questionnaire by July 2019. Participants' questionnaire data identified very high rates recurrent depression, severe anxiety and comorbidity. Participants reported high rates of treatment receipt. The age profile of sample is biased toward young adults, with higher recruitment of females and the better educated, especially at younger ages. Discussion: This paper describes the study methodology and descriptive data for GLAD, which represents a large, recontactable resource that will enable future research into risks, outcomes and treatment for anxiety and depression.","Davies, M.

It is currently necessary to develop specific serological tests that can efficiently discriminate the flaviviruses that circulate in our country. The immunoassays to diagnose SLEV lack specificity because they are based on the detection of structural viral proteins and the human immunoglobulins produced during infection against these proteins cross-react with other flaviviruses. Here, we describe an enzyme-immunoassay designed to detect human IgG antibodies specific to the viral nonstructural protein NS5. The results indicate that NS5 is a promising antigen useful to discriminate SLEV from other circulating flaviviruses.","Simari, M. B.; Goni, S. E.; Luppo, V. C.; Fabbri, C. M.; Arguelles, M.

87,"Ethnicity and Acculturation: Asian American Substance Use from Early Adolescence to Mature Adulthood","Research on Asian American substance use has, to date, been limited by monolithic conceptions of Asian identity, inadequate attention to acculturative process, and a disproportionate focus on the adolescent developmental period. This study addresses these limitations by longitudinally investigating disparities in substance use, including tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, and a range of illicit drugs, from early adolescence (~15) into mature adulthood (~40) using five waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). Ample statistical power (Asian N=1583, obs=7915) allowed disaggregated study of the most populous Asian American ethnic groups including Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Vietnamese, Asian Indian, and Japanese, as well as subjects identifying as multiple Asian ethnicities (i.e., multiethnic) and multiracial Asians. The potential mediating role of acculturative factors (e.g., nativity, parental nativity, familial language use) on the observed ethnic disparities was also examined. Results indicate significant variation across Asian ethnicities, with the lowest probability of substance use among Chinese and Vietnamese, and the highest among multiethnic and multiracial Asians. Acculturative factors (e.g., English language use, nativity) were strongly associated with increased substance use, and mediated some, but not all, of the observed ethnic disparities. This study demonstrates how the model minority stereotype masks significant ethnic disparities in Asian American substance use and argues that a considerable proportion of the observed ethnic variation appears to be due to diverse family ties speeding transition toward US cultural norms, away from the relatively salubrious norms of Asian nations of origin.","Ahmmad, Z.; Adkins, D.

103,"Early clinical markers of aggressive multiple sclerosis","Patients with the 'aggressive' form of MS accrue disability at an accelerated rate, typically reaching EDSS >= 6 within 10 years of symptom onset. Several clinicodemographic factors have been associated with aggressive MS, but less research has focused on clinical markers that are present in the first year of disease. The development of early predictive models of aggressive MS is essential to optimise treatment in this MS subtype. We evaluated whether patients who will develop severe MS can be identified based on early clinical markers, and to replicate this analysis in an independent cohort. Patient data were obtained from MSBase. Inclusion criteria were (a) first recorded disability score (EDSS) within 12 months of symptom onset, (b) at least 2 recorded EDSS scores, and (c) at least 10 years of observation time. Patients were classified as having 'aggressive MS' if they: (a) reached EDSS >= 6 within 10 years of symptom onset, (b) EDSS >=6 was confirmed and sustained over >=6 months, and (c) EDSS >=6 was sustained until the end of follow-up. Clinical predictors included patient variables (sex, age at onset, baseline EDSS, disease duration at first visit) and recorded relapses in the first 12 months since disease onset (count, pyramidal signs, bowel-bladder symptoms, cerebellar signs, incomplete relapse recovery, steroid administration, hospitalisation). Predictors were evaluated using Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA). Independent validation was performed using data from the Swedish MS Registry. Of the 2,403 patients identified, 145 were classified as having aggressive MS (6%). BMA identified three statistical predictors: age > 35 at symptom onset, EDSS >= 3 in the first year, and the presence of pyramidal signs in the first year. This model significantly predicted aggressive MS (AUC = .80, 95% CIs = .75, .84). The presence of all three signs was strongly predictive, with 32% of such patients meeting aggressive disease criteria. The absence of all three signs was associated with a 1.4% risk. Of the 556 eligible patients in the Swedish MS Registry cohort, 34 (6%) met criteria for aggressive MS. The combination of all three signs was also predictive in this cohort (AUC = .75, 95% CIs = .66, .84). Taken together, these findings suggest that older age at symptom onset, greater disability during the first year, and pyramidal signs in the first year are early indicators of aggressive MS.","Malpas, C.

Yet, questions remain about applying this approach to psychiatric conditions that are characterized by complex behaviors that occur outside the laboratory. Here, we compared individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN), whose self-starvation appears both excessively goal-directed and habitual, with healthy controls (HC) to assess: 1) whether their behavior is characterized by enhanced or diminished model-based behavior, 2) the domain specificity of any abnormalities by comparing learning in a food-specific context as well as in a monetary context, and 3) whether impairments are secondary to starvation by comparing learning before and after initial treatment. Across all conditions, individuals with AN showed an impairment in model-based, but not model-free, learning, suggesting a general and persistent contribution of habitual over goal-directed control, across domains and timepoints.","Foerde, K.; Daw, N.; Rufin, T.; Walsh, B.

115,"Acute hepatitis C infection among adults with HIV in the Netherlands: a capture-recapture analysis","Background: Reliable surveillance systems are essential to assess the national response to eliminating hepatitis C virus (HCV), in the context of the global strategy towards eliminating viral hepatitis. Aim: We aimed to assess the completeness of the two national registries of acute HCV infection in people with HIV, and estimated the number of acute HCV infections among adults with HIV in the Netherlands. Methods: For 2003-2016, cases of HCV infection and reinfection among adults with a positive or unknown HIV-serostatus were identified in two national registries: the ATHENA cohort, and the National Registry for Notifiable Diseases. For 2013-2016, cases were linked, and two-way capture-recapture analysis was carried out. Results: During 2013-2016, there were an estimated 282 (95%CI: 264-301) acute HCV infections among adults with HIV. The addition of cases with an unknown HIV-serostatus increased the matches (from N=104 to N=129), and a subsequently increased the estimated total: 330 (95%CI: 309-351). Underreporting was estimated at 14-20%. Conclusion: In 2013-2016, up to 330 cases of acute HCV infection were estimated to have occurred among adults with HIV. National surveillance of acute HCV can be improved by increased notification of infections. Surveillance data should ideally include both acute and chronic HCV infections, and be able to distinguish between acute and chronic infections, and initial and reinfections.","Boender, T.

96,"Educational differentials in domain specific physical activity by ethnicity, age, and gender: findings from over 44,000 participants in The UK Household Longitudinal Study (2013-2015).","Background: The prevalence of overall physical inactivity remains high, particularly amongst socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. It is unclear however if such inequalities vary systematically by age, sex, or ethnicity, and if there are differing effects across physical activity (PA) domains. Methods: We used data from a nationally representative survey of the UK, Understanding Society, with information on educational attainment (our indicator of socioeconomic position), PA and demographics collected in 2013-2015 (N= 44,903). Logistic regression analyses were conducted to test associations of education with three different PA domains (active travel, occupational and leisure time). To examine modification of the associations between education and physical activity in each domain by sex, age and ethnicity, we tested two-way interaction terms (education x ethnicity; education x sex; education x age). Results: Lower educational attainment was associated with higher active transportation and occupational physical activity, but lower weekly leisure-time activity. These associations were modified by sex, ethnicity, and age. For example, education-related differences in active travel were larger for females (difference in predicted probability of activity between highest and lowest educational groups: -10% in females, (95% CI: -11.9, 7.9) -3% in males (-4.8, -0.4). The education-related differences in occupational activity were larger among males -35% (-36.9, -32.4) than females -17% (-19.4, -15.0). Finally, education related differences in moderate to vigorous leisure time activity varied most substantially by ethnicity; for example, differences were 17% (16.2, 18.7) for White individuals compared with 6% (0.6, 11.6) for Black individuals. Conclusions: Educational differences in PA vary by domain, and are modified by age, sex, and ethnicity. A better understanding of physically inactive sub-groups may aid development of tailored interventions to increase activity levels and reduce health inequalities.","Fluharty, M.

93,"Evaluation of Indicators of Reproducibility and Transparency in Published Cardiology Literature","Abstract: Background The extent of reproducibility in cardiology research remains unclear. Therefore, our main objective was to determine the quality of research published in cardiology journals using eight indicators of reproducibility. Methods Using a cross-sectional study design, we conducted an advanced search of the National Library of Medicine (NLM) catalog for publications from 2014-2018 in journals pertaining to cardiology. Journals must have been published in the English language and must have been indexed in MEDLINE. Once the initial list of publications from all cardiology journals was obtained, we searched for full-text PDF versions using Open Access, Google Scholar, and PubMed. Studies were analyzed using a pilot-tested Google Form to evaluate the presence of information that was deemed necessary to reproduce the study in its entirety. Results After exclusions, we included 132 studies containing empirical data. Of these studies, the majority (126/132, 95.5%) did not provide the raw data collected while conducting the study, 0/132 (0%) provided step-by-step analysis scripts, and 117/132 (88.6%) failed to provide sufficient materials needed to reproduce the study. Conclusions The presentation of studies published in cardiology journals does not appear to facilitate reproproducible research. Considerable improvements to the framework of biomedical science, specifically in the field of cardiology, are necessary. Solutions to increase the reproducibility and transparency of published works in cardiology journals is warranted, including addressing inadequate sharing of materials, raw data, and key methodological details.","Anderson, J.

268,"Increased functional connectivity of thalamic subdivisions in patients with Parkinson's disease","Parkinson's disease (PD) affects 2-3% of the population over the age of 65 with loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra impacting the functioning of basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits. The precise role played by the thalamus is unknown, despite its critical role in the functioning of the cerebral cortex, and the abnormal neuronal activity of the structure in PD. Our objective was to more clearly elucidate how functional connectivity and morphology of the thalamus are impacted in PD (n = 32) compared to Controls (n = 20). To investigate functional connectivity of the thalamus we subdivided the structure into two important regions-of-interest, the first with putative connections to the motor cortices and the second with putative connections to prefrontal cortices. We then investigated potential differences in the size and shape of the thalamus in PD, and how morphology and functional connectivity relate to clinical variables. Our data demonstrate that PD is associated with increases in functional connectivity between motor subdivisions of the thalamus and the supplementary motor area, and between prefrontal thalamic subdivisions and nuclei of the basal ganglia, anterior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, as well as the anterior and paracingulate gyri. These results suggest that PD is associated with increased functional connectivity of subdivisions of the thalamus which may be indicative alterations to basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry.","Owens-Walton, C.; Jakabek, D.; Power, B.

822,"Structural and functional MRI changes associated with cognitive impairment and dementia in Parkinson disease","Objective: Cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease (PD) places a high burden on patients and the pathophysiological mechanisms that differentiate patients with cognitive impairment from those without it are still incompletely understood. Methods: We conducted a resting-state seed region-of-interest approach to investigate functional connectivity (FC) of important subdivisions of the caudate nucleus, putamen and thalamus in controls (n=33), cognitively unimpaired subjects (PD-CU, n=33), PD subjects with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI, n=22) and subjects with dementia (PDD, n=17). We then investigated how the morphology of these structures differed between groups. Results: PD-CU subjects, compared to controls, displayed increased and decreased FC of caudate, putamen and thalamic subdivisions. PD-MCI subjects demonstrated reduced FC of the mediodorsal thalamus with the paracingulate cortex, compared to PD-CU, and reduced FC of the mediodorsal thalamus with the posterior cingulate cortex compared to PDD. Extensive volumetric and surface-based deflation was found in subjects with dementia. Conclusions: Our research suggests that cognitive impairment and dementia in PD may be associated with a breakdown in FC of the mediodorsal thalamus with para- and posterior cingulate regions of the brain, respectively. Significance: Cognitive impairment and dementia in PD may relate to pathophysiological changes in FC of the mediodorsal thalamus.","Owens-Walton, C.; Jakabek, D.; Power, B.

90,"Expert-validated estimation of diagnostic uncertainty for deep neural networks in diabetic retinopathy detection","Deep learning-based systems can achieve a diagnostic performance comparable to physicians in a variety of medical use cases including the diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. To be useful in clinical practise, it is necessary to have well calibrated measures of the uncertainty with which these systems report their decisions. However, deep neural networks (DNNs) are being often overconfident in their predictions, and are not amenable to a straightforward probabilistic treatment. Here, we describe an intuitive framework based on test-time data augmentation for quantifying the diagnostic uncertainty of a state-of-the-art DNN for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy. We show that the derived measure of uncertainty is well-calibrated and that experienced physicians likewise find cases with uncertain diagnosis difficult to evaluate. This paves the way for an integrated treatment of uncertainty in DNN-based diagnostic systems.","Ayhan, M.

763,"Post-discharge Acute Care and Outcomes in the Era of Readmission Reduction: A National Retrospective Cohort Study of Medicare Beneficiaries in the United States","Background: With incentives to reduce readmission rates in the United States, there are concerns that patients who need hospitalization after a recent hospital discharge may be denied access, which would increase their risk of mortality. Objective: We determined whether patients with hospitalizations for conditions covered by national readmission programs who received care in emergency department (ED) or observation units but were not hospitalized within 30 days had an increased risk of death. We also evaluated temporal trends in post-discharge acute care utilization in inpatient units, emergency department (ED) and observation units for these patients. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this observational study of national Medicare claims data for 2008-2016, we identified patients 65 years of age and older hospitalized with heart failure (HF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or pneumonia, conditions included in the HRRP. Main Outcomes and Measures: Post-discharge 30-day mortality according to patients' 30-day acute care utilization. Acute care utilization in inpatient and observation units, and the ED during the 30-day and 31-90-day post-discharge period. Results: There were 3,772,924 hospitalizations for HF, 1,570,113 for AMI, and 3,131,162 for pneumonia. The overall post-discharge 30-day mortality was 8.7% for HF, 7.3% for AMI, and 8.4% for pneumonia. Risk-adjusted mortality increased annually by 0.05% (95% CI, 0.02% to 0.08%) for HF, decreased by 0.06% (95% CI, -0.09% to -0.04%) for AMI, and did not significantly change for pneumonia. Specifically, mortality increased for HF patients who did not utilize any post-discharge acute care, increasing at a rate of 0.08% per year (95% CI, 0.05% to 0.12%), exceeding the overall absolute annual increase in post-discharge mortality in heart failure, without an increase in mortality in observation units or the ED. Concurrent with a reduction in 30-day readmission rates, 30-day observation stays and visits to the ED increased across all 3 conditions during and beyond the post-discharge 30-day period. There was no significant change in overall 30-day post-acute care utilization. Conclusions: The only condition with an increasing mortality through the study period was HF; the increase preceded the policy and was not present among those received ED or observation unit care without hospitalization. Overall, during this period, there was not a significant change in the overall 30-day post-discharge acute care utilization.","Khera, R.; Wang, Y.; Bernheim, S.

95,"Reliability and validity of the UK Biobank cognitive tests","UK Biobank is a health resource with data from over 500,000 adults. The participants have been assessed on cognitive function since baseline. The cognitive tests in UK Biobank are brief and bespoke, and are administered without supervision on a touchscreen computer. Psychometric information on the tests is limited. The present study examined their concurrent validity and short-term test-retest reliability. A sample of 160 participants (mean age=62.59, SD=10.24) completed the UK Biobank cognitive assessment and a range of well-validated cognitive tests ('reference tests'). Fifty-two participants returned 4 weeks later to repeat the UK Biobank tests. Correlations were calculated between UK Biobank tests and the reference tests. Four-week test-retest correlations were calculated for UK Biobank tests. UK Biobank cognitive tests showed a range of correlations with their respective reference tests, i.e. those tests that are thought to assess the same underlying cognitive ability (mean Pearson r=0.53, range=0.22 to 0.83, p[&le;].005). Four-week test-retest reliability of the UK Biobank tests were moderate-to-high (mean Pearson r=0.55, range=0.40 to 0.89, p[&le;].003). Despite the brief, non-standard nature of the UK Biobank cognitive tests, some showed substantial concurrent validity and test-retest reliability. These psychometric results provide currently-lacking information on the validity of the UK Biobank cognitive tests.","Fawns-Ritchie, C.; Deary, I.

Institutional buyers often assume that World Health Organization (WHO) prequalified LLINs are functionally identical with a three-year lifespan. We measured the lifespans of three LLIN products, and calculated their cost-per-year of functional life, through a randomised double-blinded prospective evaluation among 3,420 study households in Tanzania using WHO-recommended methods. Primary outcome was LLIN functional survival (LLINs present in serviceable condition). Secondary outcomes were 1) bioefficacy and chemical content (residual insecticidal activity) and 2) protective efficacy for volunteers sleeping under LLINs (bite reduction and mosquitoes killed). LLIN median functional survival was significantly different: 2.0 years for Olyset, 2.5 years for PermaNet and 2.6 years for NetProtect. Functional survival was affected by accumulation of holes resulting in users discarding nets. Protective efficacy also significantly differed between products as they aged. The longer-lived nets were 20% cheaper than the shorter-lived product.","Lorenz, L. M.; Bradley, J.; Yukich, J.; Massue, D. J.; Mboma, Z. M.; Pigeon, O.; Moore, J.

117,"HIV-associated sensory neuropathy continues to be a problem in individuals starting tenofovir-based antiretroviral treatment","HIV-associated sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN) is a common and often painful neurological condition associated with HIV-infection and its treatment. However, data on the incidence of HIV-SN in neuropathy-free individuals initiating combination antiretroviral therapies (cART) that do not contain the neurotoxic agent stavudine are lacking. We investigated the six-month incidence of HIV-SN in ART naive individuals initiating tenofovir (TDF)-based cART, and the clinical factors associated with the development of HIV-SN. 120 neuropathy-free and ART naive individuals initiating cART at a single centre in Johannesburg, South Africa were enrolled. Participants were screened for HIV-SN at study enrolment and then approximately every two- months for a period of approximately six-months. Symptomatic HIV-SN was defined by the presence of at least one symptom (pain/burning, numbness, paraesthesias) and at least two clinical signs (reduced vibration sense, absent ankle reflexes or pin- prick hypoaesthesia). Asymptomatic HIV-SN required at least two clinical signs only. A total of 88% of the cohort completed three visits within the six-month period. Eleven individuals developed asymptomatic HIV-SN and nine developed symptomatic HIV-SN, giving a six-month cumulative incidence of neuropathy of 140 cases per 1000 patients (95% CI: 80 - 210) at an incidence rate of 0.37 (95% CI: 0.2 - 0.5) per person year. Increasing height and active tuberculosis (TB) disease were independently associated with the risk of developing HIV-SN (p << 0.05). We found that within the first six months of starting cART, incident SN persists in the post- stavudine era, but may be asymptomatic.","Pillay, P.; Wadley, A. L.; Cherry, C. L.; Karstaedt, A.

91,"An Assessment of Transparency and Reproducibility-related Research Practices in Otolaryngology","Introduction: Clinical research serves as the foundation for evidence-based patient care, and reproducibility of results is consequently critical. We sought to assess the transparency and reproducibility of research studies in otolaryngology by evaluating a random sample of publications in otolaryngology journals between 2014 and 2018. Methods: We used the National Library of Medicine catalog to identify otolaryngology journals that met the inclusion criteria (available in the English language and indexed in MEDLINE). From these journals, we extracted a random sample of 300 publications using a PubMed search for records published between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2018. Specific indicators of reproducible and transparent research practices were evaluated in a blinded, independent, and duplicate manner using a pilot-tested Google form. Results: Our initial search returned 26,498 records, from which 300 were randomly selected for analysis. Of these 300 records, 286 met inclusion criteria and 14 did not. Among the empirical studies, 2% (95% CI, 0.4%-3.5%) of publications indicated that raw data were available, 0.6% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.6%) reported an analysis script, 5.3% (95% CI, 2.7%-7.8%) were linked to an accessible research protocol, and 3.9% (95% CI, 1.7%-6.1%) were preregistered. None of the publications had a clear statement claiming to replicate, or to be a replication of, another study. Conclusions: Inadequate reproducibility practices exist in otolaryngology. Nearly all studies in our analysis lacked a data or material availability statement, did not link to an accessible protocol, and were not preregistered. Most studies were not available as open access. Taking steps to improve reproducibility would likely also improve patient care.","Johnson, A.

111,"Interdependence between confirmed and discarded cases of dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses in Brazil: A multivariate time-series analysis","The co-circulation of different arboviruses in the same time and space poses a significant threat to public health given their rapid geographic dispersion and serious health, social, and economic impact. Therefore, it is crucial to have high quality of case registration to estimate the real impact of each arboviruses in the population. In this work, a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model was developed to investigate the interrelationships between discarded and confirmed cases of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in Brazil. We used data from the Brazilian National Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) from 2010 to 2017. There were two waves in the series of dengue notification in this period, one occurring in 2013 and the second in 2015. The series of reported cases of both Zika and chikungunya reached their peak in late 2015 and early 2016. The VAR model shows that the Zika series have a significant impact on the dengue series and vice versa, suggesting that several discarded and confirmed cases of dengue could actually have been cases of Zika. The model also suggests that the series of confirmed chikungunya cases is almost independent of the cases of dengue and Zika. In conclusion, co-circulation of arboviruses with similar symptoms could lead to misdiagnosed diseases in the surveillance system. We argue that the use of mathematical and statistical models routinely in association with traditional symptom-surveillance could help to decrease such errors and to provide early indication of possible future outbreaks. These findings address the challenges regarding notification biases and shed new light on how to handle reported cases based only in clinical-epidemiological criteria when multiples arboviruses co-circulate in the same population.","Oliveira, J.

110,"Periodic testing and estimation of STD-HIV association","Background: The validity of measures used in follow-up studies to estimate the magnitude of the STD-HIV association will be the focus of this paper. A recent simulation study by Boily et al based on a model of HIV and STD transmission showed that the relative risk (RR), estimated by the hazard rate ratio (HRR) obtained by the Cox model had poor validity, either in absence or in presence of a real association between HIV and STD. The HRR tends to underestimate the true magnitude of a non-null association. These results were obtained from simulated follow-up studies where HIV was periodically tested every three months and every month for the STD. Aims and methods: This paper extends the above results by investigating the impact of using different periodic testing intervals on the validity of HRR estimates. Issues regarding the definition of exposure to STDs in this context are explored. A stochastic model for the transmission of HIV and other STDs is used to simulate follow-up studies with difference periodic testing intervals. HRR estimates obtained with the Cox model with a time-dependent STD exposure covariate are compared to the true magnitude of the HIV-STD association. In addition, real data are reanalysed using the STD exposure definition described in the paper. The data from Laga et al are used for this purpose. Results: (1) Simulate data: independently of the magnitude of the true association, we observed a greater reduction of the bias when increasing the frequency of HIV testing than that of the STD testing. (2) Real data: The STD exposure definition can create substantial differences in the estimation of the HIV-STD association. Laga et al have found a HRR of 2.5 (1.1 - 6.4) for the association between HIV and genital ulcer disease compare to an estimate of 3.5 (1.5 - 8.3) with our improved definition of exposure. Conclusions: Results on the simulated data have an important impact on the design of field studies. For instance when choosing between two designs; one where both HIV and STD are screened every 3 months versus one where HIV and STD are screened every 3 months and monthly, respectively. The latter design is more expensive and involves more complicated logistics. Furthermore, this increment in cost may not be justified considering the relatively small gain in terms of validity and variability.","Masse, B.; Guibord, P.; Boily, M.-C.; Alary, M.",20190716,"Hiv Aids","10.1101/19002345",1,"Benot Msse","Universit Laval","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19002345v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19002345v1.full.pdf","cc_by",NA,"The data that support the findings of this study are available from Laga et al [2].

149,"The ansa subthalamica: a neglected fiber tract","Background: The pallidofugal pathways are classically subdivided into ansa lenticularis, lenticular fasciculus, and subthalamic fasciculus. In addition to these three subsystems, we characterize an anatomical structure that connects the antero-medial pole of the subthalamic nucleus to the ventral portions of the pallidum, both related to limbic processing of information. This bundle has been previously considered to form a part of the ansa lenticularis, however, it shows striking differences on histology and MRI features compared to the ansa lenticularis, and therefore we suggest to denominate it ansa subthalamica. Objectives: To describe the ansa subthalamica as a different structure than the ansa lenticularis, that can be recognized by different methods (histology, high-field MRI and connectome tractography), including current 3T clinical imaging. Methods: A complete human brain was histologically processed and submitted to registration procedures to correct for tissue deformations and normalization to MNI space. Coordinates of histological structures were then comparable to high-field (7T) post-mortem and in vivo MRIs, 13 pre-operative 3T imaging of parkinsonian patients and normative connectome tractography. Mean intensity gray values for different structures were measured in Susceptibility-Weighted Images. Results: It was possible to characterize this structure with different methods and there was a significant difference in signal intensity in the ansa subthalamica (hypointense), compared to the ansa lenticularis (hyperintense). Conclusions: The ansa subhtalamica may represent the anatomical pathway that connects limbic regions of the STN and pallidum, and should be investigated as a possible substrate for limbic effects of stereotactic surgery of the subthalamic region.","Alho, E.

170,"Nonlinear biomarker interactions in conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer's disease","The multi-faceted nature of Alzheimer's disease means that multiple biomarkers (e.g., amyloid-beta, tau, brain atrophy) can contribute to the prediction of clinical outcomes. Machine learning methods are a powerful way to identify the best approach to this prediction. However, it has been difficult previously to model nonlinear interactions between biomarkers in the context of predictive models. This is important as the mechanisms relating these biomarkers to the disease are inter-related and nonlinear interactions occur. Here, we used Gaussian Processes to model nonlinear interactions when combining biomarkers to predict Alzheimer's disease conversion in 48 mild cognitive impairment participants who progressed to Alzheimer's disease and 158 stable (over three years) people with mild cognitive impairment. Measures included: demographics, APOE4 genotype, CSF (amyloid-beta-42, total tau, phosphorylated tau), neuroimaging markers of amyloid-beta deposition ([18F]florbetapir) or neurodegeneration (hippocampal volume, brain-age). We examined: (i) the independent value each biomarker has in predicting conversion; and (ii) whether modelling nonlinear interactions between biomarkers improved prediction performance. Despite relatively high correlations between different biomarkers, our results showed that each measured added complementary information when predicting conversion to Alzheimer's disease. A linear model predicting MCI group (stable versus progressive) explained over half the variance (R2 = 0.51, P < 0.001); the strongest independently-contributing biomarker was hippocampal volume (R2 = 0.13). Next, we compared the sensitivity of different models to progressive MCI: independent biomarker models, additive models (with no interaction terms), nonlinear interaction models. We observed a significant improvement (P < 0.001) for various two-way interaction models, with the best performing model including an interaction between amyloid-beta-PET and P-tau, while accounting for hippocampal volume (sensitivity = 0.77). Our results showed that closely-related biomarkers still contribute uniquely to the prediction of conversion, supporting the continued use of comprehensive biological assessments. A number of interactions between biomarkers were implicated in the prediction of Alzheimer's disease conversion. For example, the interaction between hippocampal atrophy and amyloid-deposition influences progression to Alzheimer's disease over and above their independent contributions. Importantly, nonlinear interaction modelling shows that although for some patients adding additional biomarkers may add little value (i.e., when hippocampal volume is high), but for others (i.e., with low hippocampal volume) further invasive and expensive testing is warranted. Our Gaussian Processes framework enables visual examination of these nonlinear interactions, allowing projection of individual patients into biomarker 'space', providing a way to make personalised healthcare decisions or stratify subsets of patients for recruitment into trials of neuroprotective interventions.","Popescu, S.; Whittington, A.; Gunn, R.

128,"Research transparency promotion by surgical journals publishing randomised controlled trials: a survey","Objective: To describe the surgical journal position statement on data-sharing policies (primary objective) and to describe the other features of their research transparency promotion. Methods: Only SURGICAL journals with an impact factor superior to 2 (Web of Science) were eligible for the study. They were not included if there were no explicit instructions for clinical trial publication in the instructions for authors and if there were no RCT published between January 2016 and January 2019. The primary outcome was the existence of a data-sharing policy in the instructions for authors. Details on research transparency promotion were also collected, namely the existence of a prospective registration of clinical trials requirement policy; a COIs disclosure requirement and a specific reference to reporting guidelines such as CONSORT for RCT. Results: Among the 87 surgical journals eligible, 82 (94%) were included in the analysis: 67 (77%) had explicit instructions for RCT and of the remaining, 15 (17.2%) had published at least one RCT between 2016-2019. The median impact factor was 2.98 [IQR=2.48-3.77] and in 2016 and 2017, the journals published a median of 11.5 RCT [IQR=5-20.75]. Data-sharing statement instructions (primary outcome) were ICMJE-compliant in four cases (4.88%), weaker in 45.12% (n=37) and inexistent in 50% (n=41) of the journals. As for data-sharing statements, no association was found between journal characteristics and the existence of data-sharing policies (ICMJE-compliant or weaker). A prospective registration of clinical trials requirement was associated with ICMJE allusion or affiliation and higher impact factors. Journals with specific RCT instructions in their OIA and journals referenced on the ICMJE website more frequently mandated the use of CONSORT guidelines. Conclusion: Research transparency promotion is still limited in surgical journals. Uniformization of journal requirements vis-a-vis ICMJE guidelines could be a first step forward for research transparency promotion in surgery.","Lombard, N.; Gasmi, A.; Sulpice, L.; Boudjema, K.; Naudet, F.; Bergeat, D.",20190722,"Surgery","10.1101/19002386",1,"Damien Bergeat","CHU Rennes","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19002386v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19002386v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"supporting data and analyze codes are available on open science frame work"

The human chemokine receptor, CX3CR1, has recently been implicated as an RSV receptor in adult epithelial cells in vitro. Here we evaluate a role for CX3CR1 in pediatric lung RSV infections. Study Design: CX3CR1 transcript levels were assessed in pediatric airways using existing RNAseq data characterizing gene expression in the upper and lower airways. Tissue localization and cell specific expression of CX3CR1 in pediatric lung tissue was confirmed using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. The role of CX3CR1 in RSV infection was also investigated in vitro using a novel, physiological model of pediatric epithelial cells. Results: Low levels of CX3CR1 transcript were often, but not always, expressed in both the upper (62%) and lower airways (36%) of pediatric subjects between 1 month and 8 years of age. CX3CR1 transcript and protein expression was detected in epithelial cells of intact, normal human pediatric lung tissues. In vitro, CX3CR1 expression was readily detected on primary cultures of differentiated pediatric/infant human lung epithelial cells. RSV demonstrated preferential infection of CX3CR1 positive cells, and blocking CX3CR1/RSV interaction significantly decreased productive viral infection in vitro. Conclusions: CX3CR1 is present in the airways of pediatric subjects where it may serve as a receptor for RSV infection. Furthermore, CX3CR1 appears to play a mechanistic role in mediating viral infection of pediatric airway epithelial cells in vitro.","Anderson, C. S.; Chu, C.-Y.; Wang, Q.; Mereness, J.

168,"Population Structure Drives Differential Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Colonization Dynamics","Background: Using a model of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) within an intensive care unit (ICU), we explore how differing hospital population structures impact these infection dynamics. Methods: Using a stochastic compartmental model of an 18-bed ICU, we compared the rates of MRSA acquisition across three potential population structures: a Single Staff Type (SST) model with nurses and physicians as a single staff type, a model with separate staff types for nurses and physicians (Nurse-MD model), and a Metapopulation model where each nurse was assigned a group of patients. By varying the proportion of time spent with the assigned patient group ({gamma}) within the Metapopulation model, we explored whether simpler models may be acceptable approximations to more realistic patient-healthcare staff contact patterns. Results: The SST, Nurse-MD, and Metapopulation models had a mean annual number of cumulative MRSA acquisitions of 40.6, 32.2 and 19.6 respectively. All models were sensitive to the same parameters in the same direction, although the Metapopulation model was less sensitive. The number of acquisitions varied non-linearly by values of {gamma}, with values below 0.40 resembling the Nurse-MD model, while values above that converged toward the metapopulation structure. Discussion: The population structure of a modeled hospital has considerable impact on model results, with the SST model having more than double the acquisition rate of the more structured Metapopulation model. While the direction of parameter sensitivity remained the same, the magnitude of these differences varied, producing different infection rates across relatively similar populations. The non-linearity of the model's response to differing values of {gamma} suggests only a narrow space of relatively dispersed nursing assignments where simple model approximations are appropriate. Conclusion: Simplifying assumptions around how a hospital population is modeled, especially assuming random mixing, may overestimate infection rates and the impact of interventions.","Mietchen, M.

109,"Analysis of the outcome of patients with stage IV uterine serous carcinoma mimicking ovarian cancer","Objectives: To identify clinicopathological factors that might influence survival in patients with stage IV uterine serous carcinoma, and to compare survival outcomes in patients with stage IV uterine serous carcinoma managed with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval cytoreduction (with or without adjuvant chemotherapy), primary cytoreductive surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of all patients with stage IV Uterine serous carcinoma treated between 2005 and 2015 within a regional cancer centre. Progression-free and overall survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan Meier method. Results: Of 50 women with stage IV uterine serous carcinoma who met inclusion criteria, 37 underwent primary cytoreductive surgery, nine received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with planned interval cytoreductive surgery and four received palliative care only. A pre-treatment diagnosis of stage IV uterine serous carcinoma was made for only 45.9% of the primary cytoreductive surgery group and 56.6% of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group, with advanced ovarian cancer the most common preoperative misdiagnosis. Median follow up was 19 months. Median overall survival was 27 months for the primary cytoreductive surgery group, 20 months for the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group and two months for the palliative care group. Optimal cytoreduction was achieved in 67.6% of the primary cytoreductive surgery group and 87.5% of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group who underwent interval cytoreduction. Optimal cytoreduction was associated with improvement in overall survival, compared with suboptimal cytoreduction (36 versus 15 months; P=0.16). Adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with significantly higher overall survival compared with no adjuvant chemotherapy (36 versus four months; P<0.05). Median overall survival was 16 months for those with pure uterine serous carcinoma (n=40), compared with 32 months for those with mixed histopathology (n=10). Conclusion: Stage IV uterine serous carcinoma can mimic advanced ovarian cancer. It carries a poor prognosis, which is worse for pure uterine serous carcinoma than for mixed-type endometrial adenocarcinoma. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval cytoreduction and adjuvant chemotherapy seems to be a safe option, with an increased rate of optimal cytoreduction and comparable overall survival, compared with primary cytoreductive surgery. Adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improves survival in all groups.","Al-Aker, M.; Nicklin, J.; Sanday, K.",20190716,"Obstetrics And Gynecology","10.1101/19002410",1,"Murad Al-Aker","Liverpool hospital, NSW2170, Australia","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19002410v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19002410v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"The data is confidential but could be accessed by third party if a reasonable request is submitted to Queensland Centre for Gyanecological Cancers"
626,"Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder: symptomatic and syndromic thresholds and diagnostic operationalization","Objective: The aim of this study is to identify the most appropriate threshold for Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) diagnosis and the impact of potential changes in diagnostic rules on prevalence levels in the community. Method: Trained psychologists evaluated 3,562 pre-adolescents/early adolescents from the 2004 Pelotas Birth Cohort with the Development and Well-Being Behavior Assessment (DAWBA). The clinical threshold was assessed in three stages: symptomatic, syndromic and clinical operationalization. The symptomatic threshold identified the response category in each DAWBA item which separates normative misbehavior from a clinical indicator. The syndromic threshold identified the number of irritable mood and outbursts needed to capture pre-adolescents/early adolescents with high symptom levels. Clinical operationalization compared the impact of AND/OR rules for combining irritable mood and outbursts on impairment and levels of psychopathology. Results: At the symptomatic threshold, most irritable mood items were normative in their lowest response categories and clinically significant in their highest response categories. For outbursts some indicated a symptom even when present at only a mild level, while others did not indicate symptoms at any level. At the syndromic level, a combination of 2 out of 7 irritable mood and 3 out of 8 outburst indicators accurately captured a cluster of individuals with high level of symptoms. Analysis combining irritable mood and outbursts delineated non-overlapping aspects of DMDD, providing support for the OR rule in clinical operationalization. The best DMDD criteria resulted in a prevalence of 3%. Conclusion: Results provide information for initiatives aiming to provide data-driven and clinically oriented operationalized criteria for DMDD.","Laporte, P. P.; Matijasevich, A.; Munhoz, T.

151,"Considerations in the deployment of novel universal vaccines against epidemic and pandemic influenza","There is increasing interest in the development of new, 'universal' influenza vaccines (UIV) that - unlike current vaccines - are effective against a broad range of seasonal influenza strains, as well as against novel pandemic viruses. Even where these vaccines do not block infection, they can moderate clinical severity, reducing morbidity and mortality while potentially also reducing opportunities for transmission. Previous modelling studies have illustrated the potential epidemiological benefits of UIVs, including their potential to mitigate pandemic burden. However, these new vaccines could shape population immunity in complex ways. Here, using mathematical models of influenza transmission, we illustrate two types of unintended consequences that could arise from their future deployment. First, by reducing the amount of infection-induced immunity in a population without fully replacing it, a seasonal UIV programme may permit larger pandemics than in the absence of vaccination. Second, the more successful a future UIV programme is in reducing transmission of seasonal influenza, the more vulnerable the population could become to the emergence of a vaccine-escape variant. These risks could be mitigated by optimal deployment of any future UIV vaccine: namely, the use of a combined vaccine formulation (incorporating conventional as well as multiple universal antigenic targets), and by achieving sufficient population coverage to compensate for reductions in infection-induced immunity. As early candidates of UIVs approach advanced clinical trials, there is a need to monitor their characteristics in such a way that is focused on their potential impact. This work offers a first step in this direction.","Arinaminpathy, N.; Riley, S.; Barclay, W.; Saad-Roy, C. M.; Grenfell, B.

119,"Obstructive sleep apnea, positive airway pressure treatment, and postoperative delirium: protocol for a retrospective observational study","Introduction Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is common among older surgical patients, and delirium is a frequent and serious postoperative complication. Emerging evidence suggests that OSA increases the risk for postoperative delirium. We hypothesize that OSA is an independent risk factor for postoperative delirium, and that in patients with OSA, perioperative adherence to positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy decreases the incidence of postoperative delirium and its sequelae. The proposed retrospective cohort analysis study will use existing datasets to: (i) describe and compare the incidence of postoperative delirium in surgical patients based on OSA diagnosis and treatment with PAP; (ii) assess whether preoperatively untreated OSA is independently associated with postoperative delirium; and (iii) explore whether preoperatively untreated OSA is independently associated with worse postoperative quality of life. The findings of this study will inform on the potential utility and approach of an interventional trial aimed at preventing postoperative delirium in patients with diagnosed and undiagnosed OSA. Methods and Analysis Observational data from existing electronic databases will be used, including over 100,000 surgical patients and ~10,000 intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. We will obtain the incidence of postoperative delirium in adults admitted postoperatively to the ICU who underwent structured preoperative assessment, including OSA diagnosis and screening. We will use doubly robust propensity score methods to assess whether untreated OSA independently predicts postoperative delirium. Using similar methodology, we will assess if untreated OSA independently predicts worse postoperative quality of life.

104,"Childhood Trauma and Trajectories of Depressive Symptoms Across Adolescence","Background: Growth curve modelling such as trajectory analysis is useful for examining the longitudinal nature of depressive symptoms, their antecedents and later consequences. However, issues in interpretation associated with this methodology could hinder the translation from results to policy changes and interventions. The aim of this article is to provide a model interpretation framework for highlighting growth curve results in a more interpretable manner. Here we demonstrate the association between childhood trauma and trajectories of depressive symptoms. Childhood trauma has been shown to a be strong predictor for later depression, but less is known how childhood trauma has an effect throughout adolescence and young adulthood. Identifying when childhood trauma (and its severity) is likely to have its greatest impact on depression is important for determining the timing of interventions for depression. Methods: We used data on over 6,500 individuals from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) to estimate trajectories of depressive symptoms between the ages of 11 and 24. Depressive symptoms were measured using the short mood and feelings questionnaire (SMFQ) across 9 occasions. Childhood trauma was assessed between the ages of 5 and 10 years old, and we estimated population averaged multilevel growth curves of depressive symptoms for exposure to trauma (yes vs no) and then in a separate model, the number of trauma types reported such as inter-personal violence or neglect (coded as 0, 1, 2, 3+). We then calculated what the depressive symptoms scores would be ages 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, between these varying trajectories. Results: Reported exposure to childhood trauma was associated with less favourable trajectories of depressive symptoms across adolescence, mainly characterised by exposed individuals having worse depressive symptoms at age 16. There was an exposure-response relationship between the number of childhood traumas and trajectories of depressive symptoms. Individuals exposed to 3 or more types of trauma had substantially steeper and less favourable trajectories of depressive symptoms: becoming worse at a more rapid rate until the age of 18. By age 18, individuals that reported the greatest exposure to trauma (3+ types of trauma) had 14% more depressive symptoms compared to non-exposed participants. Limitations: This study was subject to attrition, particularly towards the latter ages of the SMFQ. Conclusion: Childhood trauma is strongly associated with less favourable trajectories of depressive symptoms across adolescence. Individuals exposed to multiple types of inter-personal violence or neglect are at the greatest risk of worsening depressive symptoms throughout adolescence and young adulthood. Individuals exposed to traumatic experiences in childhood should be identified as at high risk of depression and other adverse outcomes as early trauma may disrupt social development and have lasting consequences on mental health outcomes. The model interpretation framework presented here may be more interpretable for researchers, clinicians and policy makers as it allows comparisons of depression across multiple stages of development to highlight when the effects of depression are greatest.","Kwong, A.

116,"Characterizing co-occurring conditions by age at diagnosis in autism spectrum disorders","Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) experience a significant number of co-occurring medical conditions, yet little is known about these conditions beyond prevalence. We hypothesized that individuals with ASD experienced an increased burden of co-occurring conditions as measured by presence, frequency, and duration of visits related to co-occurring conditions. We expected that age of ASD diagnosis (early, < 7; late, > 7) would be associated with different co-occurring conditions. Medical record data were extracted from a large anonymized medical center database for 3097 individuals with ASD and 3097 matched controls. Co-occurring conditions were characterized using a novel tool (pyPheWAS) to examine presence, frequency, and duration of each condition. We identified several categories of co-occurring conditions in ASD: neurological (epilepsy, sleep disorders); psychiatric (mood disorders, adjustment/conduct disorders, suicidal ideation), and developmental. Early ASD diagnosis was associated with epilepsy-related conditions, whereas a later diagnosis was associated with psychiatric conditions. The early ASD diagnosis group had later first diagnosis of co-occurring psychiatric conditions compared to the late ASD diagnosis group. Our work confirms individuals with ASD are under a significant medical burden, with increased duration and frequency of visits associated with co-occurring conditions. Adequate management of these conditions could reduce burden on individuals with ASD.","Failla, M. D.; Schwartz, K. L.; Chaganti, S.; Cutting, L. E.; Landman, B. A.; Cascio, C.

815,"Early assessment of molecular progression and response by whole-genome circulating tumor DNA in advanced solid tumors","Treatment response assessment for patients with advanced solid tumors is complex and existing methods require greater precision. Current guidelines rely on imaging, which has known limitations, including the time required to show a deterministic change in target lesions. Serial changes in whole-genome (WG) circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) were used to assess response or resistance to treatment early in the treatment course. 96 patients with advanced cancer were prospectively enrolled (91 analyzed and 5 excluded), and blood was collected before and after initiation of a new, systemic treatment. Plasma cell-free DNA libraries were prepared for either WG or WG bisulfite sequencing. Longitudinal changes in the fraction of ctDNA were quantified to retrospectively identify molecular progression (MP) or major molecular response (MMR). Study endpoints were concordance with first follow-up imaging (FFUI) and stratification of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Patients with MP (n=13) had shorter PFS (median 62d vs. 310d) and OS (255d vs. not reached). Sensitivity for MP to identify clinical progression was 54% and specificity was 100%. MP calls were from samples taken a median of 28d into treatment and 39d before FFUI. Patients with MMR (n=27) had longer PFS and OS compared to those with neither call (n=51). Molecular response assessment can potentially enable early switching to potentially effective therapies, therefore minimizing side effects and costs associated with additional cycles of ineffective treatment. MMR may present a novel endpoint to target to improve long-term patient outcomes.","Davis, A. A.; Iams, W. T.; Chan, D.; Lentz, R. W.; Oh, M.

132,"Teacher-rated aggression and co-occurring problems and behaviors among schoolchildren: A comparison of four population-based European cohorts","Non-pathological levels of children's co-occurring externalizing/internalizing problems in the school setting are not well characterized. We assessed associations between aggressive behavior and co-occurring externalizing/internalizing problems among schoolchildren in 39,936 teacher ratings from 4 population-based cohorts (FinnTwin12 from Finland, Generation R and the Netherlands Twin Register from the Netherlands, and the Twins Early Development Study from the UK). Correlations of aggressive behavior were high with other externalizing problems (0.47-0.80) and lower with internalizing problems (0.02-0.39). A negative association was seen with prosocial behavior, ranging -0.33 to -0.54. Although the mean levels of aggressive behavior differed significantly by gender, the correlations of aggressive behavior with co-occurring behaviors were notably more similar between the genders (e.g., aggressive-hyperactivity correlations: 0.51-0.75 boys, 0.47-0.70 girls). Comparisons are also discussed with respect to age, instrument/cohort, and parental ratings. These population-based European observations highlight the complexity of aggressive behavior at school, and can assist in creating appropriate interventions.","Whipp, A.

821,"Use of undetectable viral load to improve survey estimates of known HIV-positive status and antiretroviral treatment coverage","Introduction: Underreporting of prior HIV diagnosis and antiretroviral therapy (ART) use based on self-report is well-documented in national surveys. Antiretroviral (ARV) testing has been used to improve survey estimates, by reclassifying respondents with ARVs detected in blood as previously-diagnosed and on ART. Viral load testing, which is more affordable and more routinely available than ARV testing, is also an indicator of ART use. We examined the impact of adjusting estimated knowledge of HIV-positive status and antiretroviral therapy (ART) use based on self-report with biomarkers for antiretroviral drug detection and undetectable viral load (UVL). Methods: We reclassified HIV-positive participants aged 15-64 years in the 2012 Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey (KAIS) that were unaware of their HIV-positive status by self-report as aware and on ART if either ARVs were detected or viral load was undetectable (<550 copies/mL) on dried blood spots. We compared self-report to adjustments for ARV measurement, UVL, or both. We calculated measures of accuracy for UVL and UVL & ARV-adjusted versions of knowledge of status and ART use versus ARV-adjusted self-report as a reference standard. Results: Among 235 of 648 HIV-positive respondents with UVL, self-reported status was: 65 unaware (28.7%), 25 aware, not on ART (9.9%) and 145 aware, on ART (61.3%). Treatment coverage among all HIV-positive respondents increased from 31.8% for self-report to 42.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 37.4-47.8] based on ARV detection alone, to 42.8% (95% CI 37.9-47.8) when ARV-adjusted, 46.2% (95% CI 41.3-51.1) when UVL-adjusted and 48.8% (95% CI 43.9-53.8) when adjusted for ARV and UVL. Awareness of positive status increased from 46.9% for self-report to 56.2% (95% CI 50.7-61.6) when ARV-adjusted, 57.5% (95% CI 51.9-63.0) when UVL-adjusted, and 59.8% (95% CI 54.2-65.1) when adjusted for ARV and UVL. Sensitivity and specificity of UVL-adjusted known HIV-positive status were 95.8% and 91.3%, and of UVL-adjusted ART use were 93.0% and 88.8% respectively, versus ARV-adjusted self-report.

122,"Automated Localization and Segmentation of Mononuclear Cell Aggregates in Kidney Histological Images Using Deep Learning","Allograft rejection is a major concern in kidney transplantation. Inflammatory processes in patients with kidney allografts involve various patterns of immune cell recruitment and distributions. Lymphoid aggregates (LAs) are commonly observed in patients with kidney allografts and their presence and localization may correlate with severity of acute rejection. Alongside with other markers of inflammation, LAs assessment is currently performed by pathologists manually in a qualitative way, which is both time consuming and far from precise. Here we present the first automated method of identifying LAs and measuring their densities in whole slide images of transplant kidney biopsies. We trained a deep convolutional neural network based on U-Net on 44 core needle kidney biopsy slides, monitoring loss on a validation set (n=7 slides). The model was subsequently tested on a hold-out set (n=10 slides). We found that the coarse pattern of LAs localization agrees between the annotations and predictions, which is reflected by high correlation between the annotated and predicted fraction of LAs area per slide (Pearson R of 0.9756). Furthermore, the network achieves an auROC of 97.78 {+/-} 0.93% and an IoU score of 69.72 {+/-} 6.24 % per LA-containing slide in the test set. Our study demonstrates that a deep convolutional neural network can accurately identify lymphoid aggregates in digitized histological slides of kidney. This study presents a first automatic DL-based approach for quantifying inflammation marks in allograft kidney, which can greatly improve precision and speed of assessment of allograft kidney biopsies when implemented as a part of computer-aided diagnosis system.","Lituiev, D.

145,"Designing a text messaging program to increase adherence to medication for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease","Background: Cardiovascular medication for secondary prevention has been shown to be effective. However, cardiovascular patients have poor medication adherence, the consequences of which include premature death, recurrence risk, hospitalization, and high financial cost for the healthcare system. Behavioral interventions based on text messaging technology are a promising strategy to improving adherence in medications. In low-middle income settings there is no high-quality evidence of a behavioral program delivered by SMS; hence we describe the development, message content, and the program design of the intervention for improving adherence to cardiovascular medication. Methods: We used the model reported by Abroms and colleagues for developing and evaluating text messages-based interventions. This model describes a process in which the intervention created is based on theory and evidence, the target audience is involved to ensure the intervention is engaging and useful, and there is a focus on implementation from the outset. Results: Our main result was the design of the program, which consisted of a twelve-month structured intervention based on Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change. We wrote and validated clusters of texts messages targeting each stage of the model. Each message went through an examination process including the evaluation of former cardiovascular patients, experts and the team research personnel. Another important result was an understanding of patients perceptions of their experience of cardiovascular disease, barriers to accessing healthcare in Colombia and the use of mobile technology for health. Conclusions: An SMS intervention has the potential to be an acceptable and effective way of improving adherence to medication in patients with cardiovascular disease. This paper describes the development and content of one such intervention.","Uribe-Rodriguez, A. F.; Perez-Rivero, P.

121,"Bias correction methods for test-negative designs in the presence of misclassification","The test-negative design has become a standard approach for vaccine effectiveness studies. However, previous studies suggested that it may be more sensitive than other designs to misclassification of disease outcome caused by imperfect diagnostic tests. This could be a particular limitation in vaccine effectiveness studies where simple tests (e.g. rapid influenza diagnostic tests) are used for logistical convenience. To address this issue, we derived a mathematical representation of the test-negative design with imperfect tests, then developed a bias correction framework for possible misclassification. Test-negative design studies usually include multiple covariates other than vaccine history to adjust potential confounders; our methods can also address multivariate analyses and be easily coupled with existing estimation tools. We validated the performance of these methods using simulations of common scenarios for vaccine efficacy and were able to obtain unbiased estimates in a variety of parameter settings.","Endo, A.; Funk, S.; Kucharski, A.

265,"Personality profiles differ between patients with epileptic seizures and patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures","Aim: The primary aim of the study was to determine whether patients with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) have different personality profiles compared to patients with epileptic seizures (ES). The secondary aim was to determine whether any such personality differences could be used to efficiently screen for PNES in clinical settings. Background: PNES and ES are often difficult to differentiate, leading to incorrect or delayed diagnosis. While the current gold-standard investigation is video-EEG monitoring (VEM), it is resource intensive and not universally available. Although some research has investigated the differential psychological profiles of PNES and ES patients, most studies have focused on symptoms of psychopathology. The lack of research using modern personality models in PNES and ES presents a gap in knowledge that this study aimed to address. Methods: A retrospective collection of data was conducted on patients who completed the NEO-Five Factor Inventory questionnaire during a VEM admission to the Royal Melbourne Hospital between 2002-2017. Patients were classified as either ES or PNES based on clinical consensus diagnosis. For patients with ES, type of epilepsy and laterality of seizure focus were also recorded. Personality differences were investigated using Bayesian linear mixed effects models. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was also performed to generate sensitivities and specificities of individual personality scores. Results: 305 patients were included in the study. The 'openness to experience' domain was the only personality factor demonstrating strong evidence for a group difference (BF10 = 21.55, d = -0.43 [95% CI -0.71, -0.17]), with patients in the PNES group having higher scores compared to the ES group. Within the openness to experience domain, only the 'aesthetic interest' facet showed evidence for a group difference (BF10 = 7.98, d = -0.39 [95% CI -0.66, -0.12]). ES patients had lower scores on these measures compared to the normal population, while PNES patients did not. Both openness to experience and aesthetic interest, however, showed poor sensitivities (53%, 46% respectively) and specificities (69%, 46% respectively) for classifying PNES and ES patients. There were no differences between personality profiles in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (TLE) and non-TLE patients, or in laterality in TLE. Conclusion: Patients with ES exhibit lower openness to experience and aesthetic interest compared to patients with PNES and compared to the general population. Despite these differences, the relatively low sensitivity and specificity of these instruments suggests their use is limited in a clinical setting. Nevertheless, these findings open up new avenues of research using modern personality models to further understand patients with epilepsy and related presentations.","Leong, M.; Wang, A.

126,"Differential expression of selected microRNA and putative target genes in peripheral blood cells as early markers of severe forms of dengue","Background Dengue presents a wide clinical spectrum including asymptomatic dengue fever (DF) or severe forms, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Early symptoms of DHF are similar to those of non-life-threatening DF. Severe symptoms manifest after 3-5 days of fever, which can be life threatening due to lack of proper medications and inability to distinguish severe cases during the early stages. Early prediction of severe dengue in patients with no warning signs who may later develop severe infection is very important for proper disease management to alleviate DHF related complications and mortality. Due to the role in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and remarkable stability of microRNA, altered expression of microRNA was evaluated to explore clinically relevant biomarkers. Methodology/Principal findings The relative expression of microRNA hsa-let-7e, hsa-miR-30b-5p, hsa-miR-30e-3p, hsa-miR-33a, and hsa-miR-150-5p and several putative target genes in peripheral blood cells (PBC) collected from 20 DF and 20 DHF positive patients within four days from fever onset was evaluated by qRT-PCR. hsa-miR-150-5p showed significant (P<0.05) up regulation in PBC of DHF patients compared to DF patients during the acute phase of infection. Expression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) was significantly (P<0.05) down regulated indicating that genes involved in epigenetic regulation are also differentially expressed in DHF patients during the early stage of infection. Conclusions/Significance Differential expression of microRNA miR-150-5p and the putative target gene EZH2 may serve as reliable biomarkers of disease severity during early stages of dengue infection.","Hapugaswatta, H.; Amarasena, P.; Premaratna, R.; Seneviratne, K.

125,"A pooled analysis of the duration of chemoprophylaxis against malaria after treatment with artesunate-amodiaquine and artemether-lumefantrine","Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) are the most commonly-used treatments against Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Africa. The lumefantrine and amodiaquine partner drugs may provide differing durations of post-treatment prophylaxis, an important additional benefit to patients. Analyzing 4214 individuals from clinical trials in 12 sites, we estimated a mean duration of post-treatment protection of 13.0 days (95% CI 10.7-15.7) for AL and 15.2 days (95% CI 12.8-18.4) for AS-AQ after allowing for transmission intensity. However, the duration varied substantially between sites: where wild type pfmdr1 86 and pfcrt 76 parasite genotypes predominated, AS-AQ provided ~2-fold longer protection than AL. Conversely, AL provided up to 1.5-fold longer protection than AS-AQ where mutants were common. We estimate that choosing AL or AS-AQ as first-line treatment according to local drug sensitivity could alter population-level clinical incidence of malaria by up to 14% in under-five year olds where malaria transmission is high.","Bretscher, M.

136,"Hospital Resource Utilization in Epilepsy: Disparities in Rural vs Urban Care","Objective: This study assessed differences in resource utilization during epilepsy and seizure related hospitalizations in urban versus rural environments, to identify potential disparities in care for people living with epilepsy in rural communities. Methods: A 10 year (2001 to 2011) state-wide hospital discharge database was used. Cost, length of stay, illness severity, and procedure use were compared between urban facilities, rural facilities, and epilepsy centers. Comparison across three separate years helped to identify differences between facility type as well as to assess practices changes within facilities over time. Results: Average total charges between the three types of facilities was significantly different, with epilepsy centers having the highest average charge per patient, followed by urban and rural facilities (corrected p-values < 0.001). Illness severity was similar between the three groups, with the exception that epilepsy centers had a higher proportion of major severity cases. Length of stay remained fairly consistent across all three years for epilepsy centers (mean: 4.75 days), while decreasing for urban facilities (means: 4.39 to 3.72) and ultimately decreasing for rural facilities (mean: 3.31 to 3.09). Rates of procedure utilization revealed CT scan use persisted longer at rural facilities compared to urban facilities, while EEG and vEEG was low at rural facilities. vEEG was relatively restricted to epilepsy centers and had an initial substantial rise in use over the years and was associated with corresponding greater surgical procedure rates. Significance: This study indicates a measurable difference between epilepsy centers, urban facilities, and rural facilities in cost and procedure utilization while caring for patients during epilepsy- and seizure-related hospitalizations. If these conclusions are valid, they support that persons living with epilepsy who live in rural communities and utilize these services receive care that is considered suboptimal when compared to urban centers or epilepsy centers.","Bensken, W.

We examined the feasibility and clinical validity of rapid-turnaround metagenomics with Nanopore sequencing of respiratory samples for severe pneumonia diagnosis. Methods and Findings: We conducted a case-control study of mechanically-ventilated patients with pneumonia (nine culture-positive and five culture-negative) and without pneumonia (eight controls). We collected endotracheal aspirate samples (ETAs) and applied a microbial DNA enrichment method prior to performing metagenomic sequencing with the Oxford Nanopore MinION device. We compared Nanopore results against clinical microbiologic cultures and bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In nine culture-positive cases, Nanopore revealed communities with low alpha diversity and high abundance of the bacterial (n=8) or fungal (n=1) species isolated by clinical cultures. In four culture-positive cases with resistant organisms, Nanopore detected antibiotic resistance genes corresponding to the phenotypic resistance identified by clinical antibiograms. In culture-negative pneumonia, Nanopore revealed probable bacterial pathogens in 1/5 cases and airway colonization by Candida species in 3/5 cases. In controls, Nanopore showed high abundance of oral bacteria in 5/8 subjects, and identified colonizing respiratory pathogens in the three other subjects. Nanopore and 16S sequencing showed excellent concordance for the most abundant bacterial taxa. Conclusion: We demonstrated technical feasibility and proof-of-concept clinical validity of Nanopore metagenomics for severe pneumonia diagnosis, with striking concordance with positive microbiologic cultures and clinically actionable information offered from the sequencing profiles of culture-negative samples. Prospective studies with real-time metagenomics are warranted to examine the impact on antimicrobial decision-making and clinical outcomes.","Yang, L.; Haidar, G.; Zia, H.; Nettles, R.; Qin, S.; Wang, X.; Shah, F.; Rapport, S.

We hypothesized that HCM is characterized by the specific electrophysiological substrate as compared to patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), or healthy individuals. Methods: We conducted a prospective case-control study. The study enrolled HCM patients at high risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) (n=10; age 61{+/-}9 y; left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 60{+/-}9%), and three comparison groups: healthy individuals (n=10; age 28{+/-}6 y; LVEF>70%), ICM patients with LV hypertrophy (LVH) and known VT (n=10; age 64{+/-}9 y; LVEF 31{+/-}15%), and ICM patients with LVH and no known VT (n=10; age 70 {+/-} 7y; LVEF 46{+/-}16%). All participants underwent 12-lead ECG, cardiac CT or MRI, and 128-electrode body surface mapping (BioSemi ActiveTwo, Netherlands). Non-invasive voltage and activation maps were reconstructed using the open-source SCIRun (University of Utah) inverse problem-solving environment. Results: In the epicardial basal anterior segment, HCM patients had the greatest ventricular activation dispersion [16.4{+/-}5.5 vs. 13.1{+/-}2.7 (ICM with VT) vs. 13.8{+/-}4.3 (ICM no VT) vs. 8.1{+/-}2.4 ms (Healthy); P=0.0007], the largest unipolar voltage [1094{+/-}211 vs. 934{+/-}189 (ICM with VT) vs. 898{+/-}358 (ICM no VT) vs. 842{+/-}90 V (Healthy); P=0.023], and the greatest voltage dispersion [median(interquartile range) 215(161-281) vs. 189(143-208) (ICM with VT) vs. 158(109-236) (ICM no VT) vs. 110(106-168)V (Healthy); P=0.041].

Limited research was available regarding the respiratory health effects of coal mine fire-related PM2.5 smoke exposure. Objective This study examined associations between self-reported respiratory outcomes in adults and mine fire-related PM2.5 smoke exposure. Participants Eligible participants were adult residents of Morwell, identified using the Victorian electoral roll. Main outcome measures Self-reported data were collected as part of the Hazelwood Health Study Adult Survey. Mine fire-related PM2.5 concentrations were retrospectively modelled by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Oceans & Atmosphere Flagship. Personalised mean 24-h and peak 12-h mine fire-related PM2.5 exposures were estimated for each participant. Data were analysed by multivariate logistic regression. Results There was some evidence of a dose-response relationship between respiratory outcomes and mine fire PM2.5 concentrations. Chronic cough was associated with an Odds Ratio (OR) of 1.13 (95% Confidence Interval 1.03 to 1.23; p-value 0.007) per 10 g/m3 increment in mean PM2.5 and 1.07 (1.02 to 1.12; 0.004) per 100 g/m3 increment in peak PM2.5. Current wheeze was associated with peak PM2.5, OR=1.06 (1.02 to 1.11; 0.004) and chronic phlegm with mean PM2.5 OR=1.10 (1.00 to 1.20; 0.052). Males, participants 18-64 years and those residing in homes constructed from non-brick/concrete materials or homes with tin/metal roofs had higher estimated ORs.

144,"Alcohol causes an increased risk of head and neck but not breast cancer in individuals from the UK Biobank study: A Mendelian randomisation analysis.","Alcohol intake and the risk of various types of cancers have been previously correlated. Correlation though does not always mean that a causal relationship between the two is present. Excessive alcohol consumption is also correlated with other lifestyle factors and behaviours, such as smoking and increased adiposity, that also affect the risk of cancer and make the identification and estimation of the causal effect of alcohol on cancer difficult. Here, using individual level data for 322,193 individuals from the UK Biobank, we report the observational and causal effects of alcohol consumption on types of cancer previously suggested as correlated to alcohol. Alcohol was observationally associated with cancers of the lower digestive system, head and neck and breast cancer. No associations were observed when we considered those keeping alcohol consumption below the recommended threshold of 14 units/week. When Mendelian randomisation was used to assess the causal effect of alcohol on cancer, we found that increasing alcohol consumption, especially above the recommended level, was causal to head and neck cancers but not breast cancer. Our results where replicated using a two sample MR method and data from the much larger COGS genome wide analysis of breast cancer. We conclude that alcohol is causally related to head and neck cancers, especially cancer of larynx, but the observed association with breast cancer are likely due to confounding. The suggested threshold of 14 units/week appears suitable to manage the risk of cancer due to alcohol.","Ingold, N.; Amin, H.

Objective: The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the association between EBF and educational status, household income, marital status, media exposure, and parity in Ethiopia. Methods: Databases used were PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, SCOPUS, CINAHL and WHO Global health library, and key terms were searched using interactive searching syntax. It was also supplemented by manual searching. Observational studies published between September 2000 and March 2019 were included. The methodological quality of studies was examined using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cross-sectional studies. Data were extracted using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) data extraction tool. To obtain the pooled odds ratio (OR), extracted data were fitted in a random-effects meta-analysis model. Statistical heterogeneity was quantified using Cochran Q test, {tau}2, and I2 statistics. Additional analysis conducted includes Jackknife sensitivity analysis, cumulative meta-analysis, and meta-regression analysis. Results: Out of 553 studies retrieved, 31 studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Almost all studies were conducted on mothers with newborn less than 23 months. Maternal educational status (OR = 1.39; p = 0.03; 95% CI = 1.03 - 1.89; I2 = 86.11%), household income (OR = 1.27; p = 0.02; 95% CI = 1.05 - 1.55; I2 = 60.9%) and marital status (OR = 1.39; p = 0.02; 95% CI = 1.05 - 1.83; I2 = 76.96%) were found to be significantly associated with EBF. We also observed an inverse dose-response relationship of EBF with educational status and income. Significant association was not observed between EBF and parity, media exposure and paternal educational status. Conclusions: In this meta-analysis, we depicted the relevant effect of maternal education, income, and marital status on EBF. Therefore, multifaceted, effective, and evidence-based efforts are needed to increase national breastfeeding rates in Ethiopia.","Habtewold, T. D.; Endalamaw, A.; Mohammed, S.

257,"Leveraging multiple data types to estimate the true size of the Zika epidemic in the Americas","Since the first Zika virus (ZIKV) infection was confirmed in Brazil in May 2015, several hundred thousand cases have been reported across the Americas. This figure gives an incomplete picture of the epidemic, however, given that asymptomatic infections, imperfect surveillance, and variability in reporting rates imply that the incidence of infection was likely much higher. The infection attack rate (IAR)--defined as the proportion of the population that was infected over the course of the epidemic--has important implications for the longer-term epidemiology of Zika in the region, such as the timing, location, and likelihood of future outbreaks. To estimate the IAR and the total number of people infected, we leveraged multiple types of Zika case data from 15 countries and territories where subnational data were publicly available. Datasets included confirmed and suspected Zika cases in pregnant women and in the total population, Zika-associated Guillan-Barre syndrome cases, and cases of congenital Zika syndrome. We used a hierarchical Bayesian model with empirically-informed priors that leveraged the different case report types to simultaneously estimate national and subnational reporting rates, the fraction of symptomatic infections, and subnational IARs. In these 15 countries and territories, estimates of Zika IAR ranged from 0.084 (95% CrI: 0.067-0.096) in Peru to 0.361 (95% CrI: 0.214-0.514) in Ecuador, with significant subnational variability in IAR for every country. Totaling these infection estimates across these and 33 other countries and territories in the region, our results suggest that 132.3 million (95% CrI: 111.3-170.2 million) people in the Americas have been infected by ZIKV since 2015. These estimates represent the most extensive attempt to date to determine the size of the Zika epidemic in the Americas, and they offer an important baseline for assessing the risk of future Zika epidemics in this region.","Moore, S.

141,"Excess weight mediates changes in HDL pool that reduce cholesterol efflux capacity and increase antioxidant activity","Objective: Obesity-related decline in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) functions such as cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) has supported the notion that this lipoprotein dysfunction may contribute for atherogenesis among obese patients. Besides, potentially other HDL protective actions may be affected with weight gain and these changes may occur even before the obesity range. Methods: Lipid profile, body mass index (BMI), biochemical measurements, and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) were obtained in this cross-sectional study with 899 asymptomatic individuals. HDL functions were measured in a subgroup (n=101). Results: Individuals with increased HDL-C had an attenuated increase in cIMT with elevation of BMI. CEC, HDL-C, HDL size and HDL-antioxidant activity were negatively associated with cIMT. BMI was inversely associated with HDL-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation and CEC, but surprisingly it was directly associated with the antioxidant activity. Thus, even in non-obese, non-diabetic individuals, increased BMI is associated with a wide change in protective functions of HDL, reducing CEC and increasing antioxidant activity. In these subjects, decreased HDL concentration, size or function are related to increased atherosclerotic burden. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that in non-obese, non-diabetic individuals, the increasing values of BMI are associated with impaired protective functions of HDL and concomitant increase in atherosclerotic burden.","De Lima-Junior, J.

236,"An emergent, high-fatality lung disease in systemic juvenile arthritis","Objective To investigate characteristics and risk factors of a novel parenchymal lung disease, increasingly detected in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA). Methods In a multi-center retrospective study, 61 cases were investigated, using physician-reported clinical information and centralized analyses of radiologic, pathologic and genetic data. Results Lung disease (LD) was associated with distinctive features, including acute erythematous clubbing and a high frequency of anaphylactic reactions to the IL-6 inhibitor, tocilizumab. Serum ferritin elevation and/or significant lymphopenia preceded LD detection. The most prevalent chest CT pattern was septal thickening, involving the periphery of multiple lobes +/- ground glass opacities. Predominant pathology (23/36) was pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and/or endogenous lipoid pneumonia (PAP/ELP), with atypical features, including regional involvement and concomitant vascular changes. Apparent severe delayed drug hypersensitivity occurred in some cases. 5-year survival was 42%. Whole-exome sequencing (20/61) did not identify a novel monogenic defect PAP-related or macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)-related mutations as likely primary cause. Trisomy 21 (T21) increased LD risk, as did young sJIA onset. Refractory sJIA was not required for LD development. Exposure to interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 inhibitors (46/61) was associated with multiple LD features. By several indicators, severity of sJIA was comparable in drug-exposed subjects and published sJIA cohorts. MAS at sJIA onset was increased in the drug-exposed, but it was not associated with LD features. Conclusions A rare, life-threatening LD in sJIA is defined by a constellation of unusual clinical characteristics. The pathology, a PAP/ELP variant, suggests macrophage dysfunction. Inhibitor exposure may promote LD, independent of sJIA severity, in a small subset of treated patients. Treatment/prevention strategies are needed.","Saper, V.; Chen, G.; Deutsch, G.; Guillerman, R.

189,"Association between the ACE I/D gene polymorphism and progressive renal failure in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease: A meta-analysis","Objective The angiotensin converting enzyme insertion/deletion (ACE I/D) gene polymorphism is involved in a wide range of clinical outcomes. This makes ACE I/D an important genetic marker. Updating the genetic profile of ACE I/D and raising the evidence for its role in renal disease is therefore needed. Reported associations of ACE I/D with progressive renal failure (PRF) in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) have been inconsistent, prompting a meta-analysis to obtain more precise estimates. Methods Multi-database search yielded 18 articles for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Risks (odds ratios [ORs] and 95% confidence intervals) were estimated by comparing the ACE genotypes (heterozygote ID, homozygotes DD and II). Heterogeneous (random-effects) pooled associations were subjected to outlier treatment which yielded fixed-effects outcomes and split the findings into pre- (PRO) and post- (PSO) outlier status. Subgroup analysis was based on ethnicity (Asian/Caucasian) and minor allele frequency (maf). The [&ge;]0.50 maf subgroup indicates higher frequency of the variant II genotype over that of the common DD genotype, otherwise, the subgroup is considered <0.50 maf. Stability of the associative effects was assessed with sensitivity treatment. Temporal trend of association was examined with cumulative meta-analysis. Results In the PSO analysis, overall effects were null (ORs 0.99-1.02) but not in the subgroups (Asian and [&ge;]0.50 maf), where in presence of the D allele (DD/ID) and the I allele (II), increased (ORs 1.63-5.62) and reduced (OR 0.22) risks were observed, respectively. Of these pooled effects, the Asian and [&ge;]0.50 maf homozygous DD genotypes had high ORs (5.01-5.63) indicating elevated magnitude of effects that were highly significant (Pa <10-5) and homogeneous (I2 = 0%), in addition to their robustness. In contrast, the Caucasian and <0.50 maf subgroup effects were: (i) non-heterogeneous (fixed-effects) at the outset, which did not require outlier treatment and (ii) non-significant (ORs 0.91-1.10, Pa = 0.15-0.79). Cumulative meta-analysis revealed increased precision of effects over time. Conclusions PRF in ADPKD impacted the Asian and [&ge;]0.50 maf subgroups where DD homozygote carriers were up to 6-fold susceptible. The high magnitude of these effects were highly significant, homogeneous and robust indicating strong evidence of association.","Pabalan, N.; Tharabenjasin, P.; Parcharoen, Y.; Tasanarong, A.",20190809,"Nephrology","10.1101/19002949",1,"Noel Pabalan","Thammasat University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19002949v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19002949v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting information files"
135,"fMRI as an outcome measure in clinical trials: A systematic review in clinicaltrials.gov","Background: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is quickly becoming a significant outcome measure for clinical trials and as more than one thousand trials with fMRI as an outcome measure were registered in clinicaltrials.gov at the time of writing this article. However, 93% of these registered trials are still not completed with published results and there is no picture available about methodological dimensions of these ongoing trials with fMRI as an outcome measure. Methods: We collected trials that use fMRI as an outcome measure by searching ""fMRI"" in the ClinicalTrials.gov registry on October 13 2018 and reviewing each trial's record entry. Eligible trials' characteristics were extracted and summarized. Results: In total, 1386 clinical trials were identified that reported fMRI in their outcome measures with fMRI as the only primary outcome in 33% of them. 82% of fMRI trials were started after 2011. The most frequent intervention was drug (29%). 57% of trials had parallel assignment design and 20% were designed for cross over assignment. For task-based fMRI, cognitive systems (46%) based on RDoC was the most frequent domain of tasks, followed by positive valence systems (19%), systems for social processing (10%), and sensorimotor systems (5%). Less than one-third of trials (28%) registered at least one region of interest for their analysis. Food cue reactivity task, pain perception task, n-back task, and monetary incentive delay task were recruited in more than 25 registered trials. Conclusion: The number of fMRI trials (fMRI as an outcome measure) with both task and rest protocols is growing rapidly. Different RDoC domains are covered by various tasks in fMRI trials. However, our study suggests the need of greater harmony and better standardization for registration of fMRI details on both methods and analysis which would allow for more effective comparison across studies in systematic reviews and also help the validation of results towards having fMRI as a biomarker in the future.","Sadraee, A.; Paulus, M.; Ekhtiari, H.",20190725,"Radiology And Imaging","10.1101/19002972",1,"Alaleh Sadraee","Institute for Cognitive Science Studies, Tehran, Iran","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19002972v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19002972v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"The data-set is available in supplementary materials."
504,"Validation of Serum Neurofilaments as Prognostic & Potential Pharmacodynamic Biomarkers for ALS","Objective. Identify preferred neurofilament assays, and clinically validate serum NfL and pNfH as prognostic and potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers relevant to ALS therapy development. Methods. Prospective, multi-center, longitudinal observational study of patients with ALS (n=229), primary lateral sclerosis (PLS, n=20) and progressive muscular atrophy (PMA, n=11). Biological specimens were collected, processed and stored according to strict standard operating procedures (SOPs) 1. Neurofilament assays were performed in a blinded manner by independent contract research organizations (CROs). Results. For serum NfL and pNfH measured using the Simoa assay, missing data (i.e. both technical replicates below the lower limit of detection (LLD) was not encountered. For the Iron Horse and Euroimmun pNfH assays, such missingness was encountered in ~4% and ~10% of serum samples respectively. Mean coefficients of variation (CVs) for pNfH in serum and CSF were ~4-5% and ~2-3% respectively in all assays. Baseline NfL concentration, but not pNfH, predicted the future ALSFRS-R slope and survival. Incorporation of baseline serum NfL into mixed effects models of ALSFRS-R slopes yields an estimated sample size saving of ~8%. Depending on the method used to estimate effect size, use of serum NfL (and perhaps pNfH) as pharmacodynamic biomarkers, instead of the ALSFRS-R slope, yields significantly larger sample size savings. Conclusions. Serum NfL may be considered a clinically validated prognostic biomarker for ALS. Serum NfL (and perhaps pNfH), quantified using the Simoa assay, have potential utility as pharmacodynamic biomarkers of treatment effect.","Benatar, M.; Zhang, L.; Wang, L.; Granit, V.; Statland, J.; Barohn, R.

142,"The Paradox of Female Obesity in Low and Lower-Middle Income Countries","Setting: Obesity, once considered an epidemic of the developed world, is now becoming an even more prominent problem than underweight in low and lower-middle income countries (LLMICs). Ample literature has shown that as the income of a country increases, the burden of obesity shifts from the rich to the poor. Many studies have explored the effects of various social determinants of health on obesity, but few have studied the association between obesity and education. Additionally, while some data exists on the association in men, there have been limited comprehensive studies focusing on the relationship in the female population of LLMICs. Objective: Globally, adult females have a higher prevalence of obesity and the obesity shift occurs more quickly for women than for men. We aim to address this disparity and explore the association of education and obesity in women. Design: In this cross-sectional study, we used a multi-national and multi-year database from the publicly available Demographic and Health Surveys program with data from 34 LLMICs. Results: Our age-adjusted analysis shows that women in LLMICs with higher education have a significantly greater prevalence of obesity than women with no education. We analyzed this phenomenon by individual nations, continents, and income classifications. Educated women living in low income countries are 5.12 times more likely to be obese than uneducated women (APR, 95% CI=4.75, 5.32) and 3.48 times (APR, 95% CI=3.37, 3.60) more likely in lower-middle income countries. Conclusion: These findings highlight a need for more studies and policy attention focusing on female education levels to understand, predict, and prevent obesity in LLMICs.","Tang, C. Y.; Woldu, H.

180,"Improvements in the incidence and survival of cancer and cardiovascular but not infectious disease have driven recent mortality improvements in Scotland: nationwide cohort study of linked hospital admission and death records 2001-2016","Objectives: To identify the causes and future trends underpinning improvements in life expectancy in Scotland and quantify the relative contributions of disease incidence and survival. Design: Population-based study. Setting: Linked secondary care and mortality records across Scotland. Participants: 1,967,130 individuals born between 1905 and 1965, and resident in Scotland throughout 2001-2016. Main outcome measures: Hospital admission rates and survival in the five years following admission for 28 diseases, stratified by sex and socioeconomic status. Results: The five hospital admission diagnoses associated with the greatest burden of death were ""Influenza and pneumonia"", ""Symptoms and signs involving the circulatory and respiratory systems"", ""Malignant neoplasm of respiratory and intrathoracic organs"", ""Symptoms and signs involving the digestive system and abdomen"", and ""General symptoms and signs"". Using trends in disease, we modelled a mean mortality hazard ratio of 0.737 (95% CI 0.730-0.745) across decades of birth, equivalent to a life extension of ~3 years per decade. This improvement was 61% (30%-93%) accounted for by improvements in disease survival after hospitalisation (principally cancer) with the remainder accounted for by a fall in hospitalisation incidence (principally heart disease and cancer). In contrast, deteriorations in the incidence and survival of infectious diseases reduced mortality improvements by 9% (~3.3 months per decade). Overall, health-driven mortality improvements were slightly greater for men than women (due to greater falls in disease incidence), and generally similar across socioeconomic deciles. We project mortality improvements will continue over the next decade but will slow down by 21% because much of the progress in disease survival has already been achieved. Conclusion: Morbidity improvements broadly explain observed improvements in overall mortality, with progress on the prevention and treatment of heart disease and cancer making the most significant contributions. The gaps between men and women's morbidity and mortality are closing, but the gap between socioeconomic groups is not. A slowing trend in improvements in morbidity may explain the stalling in improvements of period life expectancies observed in recent studies in the UK. However, our modelled slowing of improvements could be offset if we achieve even faster improvements in the major diseases contributing to the burden of death, or if we improve prevention and survival of diseases which have deteriorated recently, such as infectious disease, in the future.","Timmers, P.

266,"Distinct psychopathology profiles in patients with epileptic seizures compared to non-epileptic psychogenic seizures","Objective: Similarities in clinical presentations between epileptic seizures (ES) and psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) produces a risk of misdiagnosis. Video-EEG monitoring (VEM) is the diagnostic gold standard, but involves significant cost and time commitment, suggesting a need for efficient screening tools. Methods: 628 patients were recruited from an inpatient VEM unit; 293 patients with ES, 158 with PNES, 31 both ES and PNES, and 146 non-diagnostic. Patients completed the SCL-90-R, a standardised 90-item psychopathology instrument. Bayesian linear models were computed to investigate whether SCL-90-R domain scores or the overall psychopathology factor p differed between groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were computed to investigate the PNES classification accuracy of each domain score and p. A machine learning algorithm was also used to determine which subset of SCL-90-R items produced the greatest classification accuracy. Results: Evidence was found for elevated scores in PNES compared to ES groups in the symptom domains of anxiety (b = 0.47, 95%HDI = [0.10, 0.80]), phobic anxiety (b = 1.32, 95%HDI = [0.98, 1.69]), somatisation (b = 0.84, 95%HDI = [0.49, 1.20]), and the general psychopathology factor p (b = 1.35, 95%HDI = [0.86, 1.82]). Of the SCL-90-R domain scores, somatisation produced the highest classification accuracy (AUC = 0.74, 95%CI = [0.69, 0.79]). The genetic algorithm produced a 6-item subset from the SCL-90-R, which produced comparable classification accuracy to the somatisation scores (AUC = 0.73, 95%CI = [0.64, 0.82]). Significance: Compared to patients with ES, patients with PNES report greater symptoms of somatisation, general anxiety, and phobic anxiety against a background of generally elevated psychopathology. While self-reported psychopathology scores are not accurate enough for diagnosis in isolation, elevated psychopathology in these domains should raise the suspicion of PNES in clinical settings.","Wang, A.

Methods Seventy-five participants were recruited into three cohorts; young healthy (YH) group, old healthy (OH) and those at high-risk for exudative AMD. Raw OCT and OCT-A data from TOPCON DRI OCT Triton were exported using Topcon IMAGENET 6.0 software, and 3D datasets were analysed to determine retinal thickness and vessel density. Results Central macular thickness measurements revealed a trend of overall retinal thinning with increasing age. VD through the full thickness of the retina was highest in ETDRS sector 4 (the inferior macula) in all the cohorts. Mean VD was significantly higher in the deep capillary plexus than the superficial capillary plexus in all ETDRS sectors in all cohorts but there was no significant difference noted between groups. Choriocapillaris VD was significantly lower in all ETDRS sectors in the in the AMD group compared with the YH and the OH groups. Conclusions Retinal vessel density maps, derived from the retinal plexi are not reliable biomarkers for assessing the ageing macular. Our non-proprietary analysis of the vascular density of the choriocapillaris revealed a significant drop off of VD with age and disease but further work is required to corroborate this finding. If repeatable, choriocapillaris VD may provide a non-invasive biomarker of healthy ageing and disease.","Vaghefi, E.; Hill, S.; Kresten, H.; Squirrell, D.",20190725,"Ophthalmology","10.1101/19003053",1,"Ehsan Vaghefi","University of Auckland","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19003053v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19003053v1.full.pdf","cc_no","10.1097/APO.0000000000000278","Data can be made available by reasonable request from authors"
205,"Prevalence of diabetic foot ulcer and its association with duration of illness and residence in Ethiopia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","Abstract Background: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), devastating complications of diabetes mellitus, is a major public health problem, and one of the leading reasons for hospital admission, amputations, and even death among diabetic patients in Ethiopia. Despite its catastrophic health consequences, the national burden of diabetic foot ulcer remains unknown in Ethiopia. Hence, the objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the national prevalence of diabetic foot ulcer and investigate the association with duration of illness and patient residence among diabetic patients. Methods: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases for studies of diabetic foot ulcers prevalence that published from conception up to June 30, 2019. Quality of each article was assessed using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cross-sectional studies. All statistical analyses were done using STATA version 14 software for Windows, and meta-analysis was carried out using a random-effects method. The pooled national prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers was presented using a forest plot. Results: A total of 10 studies with 3,029 diabetic patients were included. The pooled national prevalence of diabetic foot ulcers among Ethiopian diabetic patients was 11.27% (95% CI 7.22, 15.31%, I2=94.6). Duration of illness (OR: 3.91, 95%CI 2.03, 7.52, I2=63.4%) and patient residence (OR: 3.40, 95%CI 2.09, 5.54, I2=0.0%) were significantly associated with a diabetic foot ulcer. Conclusion: In Ethiopia, at least one out of ten diabetic patients had diabetic foot ulcers. Healthcare policymakers (FMoH) need to improve the standard of diabetic care and should design effective preventive strategies to improve health care delivery for people with diabetes and reduce the risk of foot ulceration.

191,"Host genetic variants near the PAX5 gene locus associate with susceptibility to invasive group A streptococcal disease","We undertook a genome-wide association study of susceptibility to invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) disease combining data from distinct clinical manifestations and ancestral populations. Amongst other signals, we identified a susceptibility locus located 18kb from PAX5, an essential B-cell gene, which conferred a nearly two-fold increased risk of disease (rs1176842, odds ratio 1.8, 95% confidence intervals 1.5-2.3, P=3.2x10-7). While further studies are needed, this locus could plausibly explain some inter-individual differences in antibody-mediated immunity to GAS, perhaps providing insight into the effects of intravenous immunoglobulin in streptococcal toxic shock.","Parks, T.; Auckland, K.; Lamagni, T.

155,"A study of knowledge, experience and beliefs about hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in south western Uganda","Introduction: United Nations sustainable development goals aim for the elimination of viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030, leading to efforts to upscale the availability and accessibility of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination, diagnosis and treatment globally. However, a variety of societal factors, including beliefs, traditions, and stigma, can be a major obstacle to all of these interventions. We therefore set out to investigate how HBV is understood and described in communities in Uganda, and whether there is evidence of potential stigma. Method: We carried out a qualitative formative study in two sites in South Western Uganda: a village in Kalungu district (site A) and an area on the outskirts of Masaka town (site B). We undertook a rapid assessment to investigate how adults describe HBV infection and their perceptions about the infection. We collected data by conducting a transect walk, observations, community group discussions, and in-depth interviews, sampling a total of 131 individuals. We used inductive content analysis to extract key themes associated with HBV. Results: There is no specific word for HBV infection in local languages, and knowledge about this infection is varied. While some individuals were completely unfamiliar with HBV infection, some had heard of HBV. Radio was a common source of information. There was awareness of HBV as a cause of liver disease, limited knowledge regarding the cause, mode of transmission and treatment. Stigma in HBV may be rare in this community due to limited understanding and experience of HBV. Conclusion: There is an ongoing need to improve awareness and understanding of HBV in this community. Careful dissemination of accurate information is required to promote acceptance of interventions for prevention, diagnosis and treatment.","Mugisha, J.; Mokaya, J.; Bukenya, D.; Ssembajja, F.; Mayambala, D.; Newton, R.; Matthews, P.

154,"Contrasting Evidence to Reimbursement Reality for Off-label use (OLU) of Drug Treatments in Cancer Care - Rationale and Design of the CEIT-OLU-project","Background: Off-label drug use (OLU) reflects a perceived unmet medical need, which is common in oncology. Cancer drugs are often highly expensive and their reimbursement is a challenge for many health care systems. OLU is frequently regulated by reimbursement restrictions. For evidence-based health care, treatment ought to be reimbursed if there is sufficient clinical evidence for treatment benefit independently of patient factors not related to the treatment indication. However, little is known about the reality of OLU reimbursement and its association with the underlying clinical evidence. Here we aim to investigate the relationship of reimbursement decisions with the underlying clinical evidence. Methods/ Design: We extract patient characteristics and details on treatment and reimbursement of cancer drugs from over 3000 patients treated in three Swiss hospitals. We systematically search for clinical trial evidence on benefits associated with OLU in the most common indications. We will describe the prevalence of OLU in Switzerland and its reimbursement in cancer care, and use multivariable logistic regression techniques to investigate the association of approval/rejection of a reimbursement requests to the evidence on treatment effects and to further factors, including type of drug, molecular predictive markers and the health insurer. Discussion: Our study will provide a systematic overview and assessment of OLU and its reimbursement reality in Switzerland. We may provide a better understanding of the access to cancer care that is regulated by health insurers and we hope to identify factors that determine the level of evidence-based cancer care in a highly diverse Western health care system.","Herbrand, A.

147,"The Human Leukocyte Antigen Locus and Susceptibility to Rheumatic Heart Disease in South Asians and Europeans","Background. Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Several reports have linked the disease to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus but with negligible consistency. Methods. We undertook a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of susceptibility to RHD in 1163 South Asians (672 cases; 491 controls) recruited in India and Fiji. We analysed directly obtained and imputed genotypes, and followed-up associated loci in 1459 Europeans (150 cases; 1309 controls) from the UK Biobank study. For fine-mapping, we used HLA imputation to define classical alleles and amino acid polymorphisms. Results. A single signal situated in the HLA class III region reached genome-wide significance in the South Asians, and replicated in the Europeans (rs201026476; combined odds ratio 1.81, 95% confidence intervals 1.51-2.18, P=3.48x10-10). While the signal fine-mapped to specific amino acid polymorphisms within HLA-DQB1 and HLA-B, with conditioning, the lead class III variant remained associated with susceptibility (P=3.34x10-4), suggesting an independent effect. Conclusions. A complex HLA signal, likely comprising at least two underlying causal variants, strongly associates with susceptibility to RHD in South Asians and Europeans. Crucially, the involvement of the class III region may partly explain the previous inconsistency, while offering important new insight into pathogenesis.","Auckland, K.; Mittal, B.; Cairns, B.

196,"Insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, anxiety, depression and socioeconomic status among customer service employees in Canada","Objectives: The present study alerts on the potential effect of working full time in a call center as a risk factor for neuropsychiatric illnesses. It is the first study investigating deeply presence of anxiety, depression, insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness among a large population of customer service employees. It has 3 specifics goals which were (1) document presence of sleep disorders among customer service advisors (2) document presence of anxiety and depression in this population (3) determine the influence of the socioeconomic status, duration in position and full time or part-time shift on the diseases above. Findings: It was found that the majority of people working in customer service are undergraduate students or at a secondary/high school degree. They worked full time, are single and have reported at least two of the neuropsychiatric disorders assessed in the present study. Among customer service advisors enrolled in this study, all neuropsychiatric disorders investigated were present and significantly higher for those working full time. Perceived socioeconomic status (pSES) was almost similar for full time and part time workers with a mean score of 4.8 on the MacArthur scale of subjective social status. Results revealed that duration in position was an excellent predictor of insomnia, sleepiness and anxiety (respectively with R2=91,83%, R2=81,23% and R2=87,46%) but a moderate predictor of depression (R2=69,14%). The pSES was a moderate predictor of sleep disorders (respectively R2=62,04% for insomnia and R2=53,62% for sleepiness) but had a strong association with anxiety and depression (R2=82,95% for anxiety and R2=89,77% for depression). It was found that insomnia and anxiety are more prevalent for immigrants and international students compared to Canadians, while depression was similarly higher for Canadian and immigrants compared to international students. It was found that sleepiness has the same trend in the three subgroups. Conclusion: Customer service employees are exposed to a continuous stimulation of their cognitive functions in addition to different stressors which can progressively and silently damage the nervous system. Investigations on mental and physical health of customer service advisors are worthy of interest, and understanding how their work, their rotating shifts and their socioeconomic status influence their resilience and their performance at work; may help comprehension of similar health issues emerging in similar populations with similar occupations.","Etindele Sosso, F.",20190812,"Occupational And Environmental Health","10.1101/19003194",1,"Fa Etindele Sosso","Center for Advanced Research in Sleep Medicine","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19003194v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19003194v1.full.pdf","cc_by",NA,"All data are available on demand."
167,"Changing trends in proportional incidence and 5-year net survival of screened and nonscreened invasive breast cancers among women in England","Background: Uptake of breast cancer screening has been decreasing in England since 2007, and may increase proportional incidence of nonscreened cancers. However, recent trends in proportional incidence and net-survivals of screened and nonscreened breast cancers are unclear. Methods: We extracted population-based proportional incidence and age-standardized 5-year net-survivals from Public Health England, for English women with invasive breast cancer diagnosed during 1995-2011 (linked to death certificates, followed through 2016). Piecewise log-linear models with change-point/joinpoint were used to estimate temporal trends. We conducted a quasi-experimental study to test the hypothesis that the trend-change year of proportional incidence coincided with that of 5-year net-survival. Results: Among 254,063 women in England with invasive breast cancer diagnosed during 1995-2011, there was downward-to-upward trend-change in proportional incidence of nonscreened breast cancers (annual percent change[APC]=5.6 after 2007 versus APC=-3.5 before 2007, P<0.001) in diagnosis-year 2007, when steeper upward-trend in age-standardized 5-year net survival started (APC=5.7 after 2007/2008 versus APC=0.3 before 2007/2008, P<0.001).. Net-survival difference of screened versus nonscreened cancers also significantly narrowed (18% in 2007/2008 versus 5% in 2011). Similar associations were found in all strata of race, cancer stage, grade and histology, except in Black patients or patients with stage I, stage III, or grade I cancer. Conclusions: The downward-to-upward trend-change in proportional incidence of nonscreened breast cancers is associated with steeper upward-trend in age-standardized 5-year net survival among English women in recent years. Survival benefits of breast cancer screening appear decreasing in recent years. The data support reduction of breast cancer screening in some patients.","Wu, H.; Wong, K.; Lu, S.-E.; Broggio, J.; Zhang, L.",20190801,"Primary Care Research","10.1101/19003202",1,"Lanjing Zhang","Princeton Medical Center/Rutgers University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19003202v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19003202v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"We cannot share the original data which are confidential, and were obtained with review and approval from the Public Health England."
156,"Association of Kras mutation with tumor deposit status and overall survival of colorectal cancer","Background The recent staging manual upstages Node-negative tumor-deposit positive colorectal cancer (CRC) from N0 to N1c category, while the development of tumor-deposit presence is poorly understood. Meanwhile, Kras mutation is associated with progression of CRC, but its link to tumor-deposit status is unclear. Method: This retrospective cohort study included the patients with incidental CRC diagnosed during 2010-2014 in the National Cancer Database and recorded statuses of Kras and tumor deposit. We conducted multivariable logistic regression and Cox regression analyses to investigate the factors associated with tumor-deposit status and overall-survival, respectively. Results A total of 48,200 CRC patients with Kras status were included in the study (25,407 [52.7%] men, 25,648[46.8%] <65 years old, 18 381 [38.1%] with Kras mutation). Adjusted for microsatellite instability, age, pathologic stage and tumor grade, Kras mutation (versus wild-type) was associated with tumor-deposit presence (n=15,229, odds ratio=1.11, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.20). Kras mutation was also independently linked to a worse overall survival of CRC patients regardless of tumor-deposit status (n=8,110, adjusted Hazard ratio=1.40, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.79 for CRC with tumor deposits, and n=2,618, adjusted HR=1.63, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.28 for CRC without), but a better survival in CRC with no known/applicable tumor-deposit status (n=457, adjusted Hazard ratio =0.32, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.95). Conclusion Kras mutation is independently associated with tumor-deposit presence, and a worse overall survival of CRC with or without tumor-deposit. Therefore, it may play a role in the development of tumor deposits and serve as a target for CRC treatment.","Zhang, M.; Hu, W.; Hu, K.; Lin, Y.; Feng, Z.; Yun, J.-P.; Gao, N.; Zhang, L.",20190730,"Pathology","10.1101/19003210",1,"Lanjing Zhang","Princeton Medical Center/Rutgers University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19003210v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19003210v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"We cannot share the patient-level data which are confidential and were obtained with review and approval from the National Cancer Database and the American College of Surgeons.

148,"Esophageal Cooling For Protection During Left Atrial Ablation: A Systematic Review And Meta-Analysis","Objective: We sought to perform a meta-analysis of existing studies evaluating esophageal cooling via direct liquid instillation for the reduction of thermal injury. Methods: We reviewed Medline for existing studies involving esophageal cooling for protection of thermal injury during RF ablation. A meta-analysis was then performed using random effects model to calculate estimated effect size with 95% confidence intervals, with outcome of esophageal lesions, stratified by severity, as determined by post-procedure endoscopy. Results: A total of 9 studies were identified and reviewed. After excluding pre-clinical and mathematical model studies, 3 were included in the meta-analysis, totaling 494 patients. Esophageal cooling showed a tendency to shift lesion severity downward, such that total lesions did not show a statistically significant change (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.15 to 2.38). For high grade lesions, a significant OR of 0.39 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.89) in favor of esophageal cooling was found, suggesting that esophageal cooling, even utilizing a low-capacity thermal extraction technique, reduces lesion severity from RF ablation. Conclusions: Esophageal cooling reduces lesion severity encountered during RF ablation, even when using relatively low heat extraction methods such as direct instillation of cold liquid. Further investigation of this approach is warranted.","Leung, L.; Gallagher, M.; Santangeli, P.; Tschabrunn, C.; Guerra, J.

253,"Toward Automated Classification of Pathological Transcranial Doppler Waveform Morphology via Spectral Clustering","Cerebral Blood Flow Velocity waveforms acquired via Transcranial Doppler (TCD) can provide evidence for cerebrovascular occlusion and stenosis. Thrombolysis in Brain Ischemia (TIBI) flow grades are widely used for this purpose, but require subjective assessment by expert evaluators to be reliable. In this work we seek to determine whether TCD morphology can be objectively assessed using an unsupervised machine learning approach to waveform categorization. TCD beat waveforms were recorded at multiple depths from the Middle Cerebral Arteries of 106 subjects; 33 with CTA-confirmed Large Vessel Occlusion (LVO). From each waveform, three morphological variables were extracted, quantifying absolute peak onset, number/prominence of auxiliary peaks, and systolic canopy length. Spectral clustering identified groups implicit in the resultant three-dimensional feature space, with gap-statistic criteria establishing the optimal cluster number. We found that gap-statistic disparity was maximized at four clusters, referred to as flow types I, II, III, and IV. Types I and II were primarily composed of control subject waveforms, whereas types III and IV derived mainly from LVO patients. Cluster morphologies for types I and IV aligned clearly with Normal and Blunted TIBI flows, respectively. Types II and III represented commonly observed flow-types not delineated by TIBI, which nonetheless deviate quantifiably from normal and blunted flows. We conclude that important morphological variability exists beyond that currently quantified by TIBI in populations experiencing or at-risk for acute ischemic stroke, and posit that the observed flow-types provide the foundation for objective methods of real-time automated flow type classification.","Thorpe, S.

187,"The Effects of Metronome Frequency Differentially Affects Gait on a Treadmill and Overground in People with Parkinson's Disease","Objective: To determine the effect of different metronome cue frequencies on spatiotemporal gait parameters when walking overground compared to walking on a treadmill in people with Parkinson's disease Design: Repeated-measures, within-subject design Setting: Research laboratory Participants: Twenty-one people with Parkinson's disease (Hoehn & Yahr stage 1-3) Interventions: Participants walked overground and on a treadmill with and without metronome cues of 85%, 100%, and 115% of their baseline cadence for one minute each. Main Outcome Measures: Gait speed, step length, and cadence Results: An interaction effect between cue frequency and walking environment revealed that participants took longer steps during the 85% condition on the treadmill only. When walking overground, metronome cues of 85% and 115% of baseline cadence yielded decreases and increases, respectively, in both cadence and gait speed with no concomitant change in step length. Conclusions: These data suggest that people with PD are able to alter spatiotemporal gait parameters immediately when provided the appropriate metronome cue and walking environment. We propose to target shortened step lengths by stepping to the beat of slow frequency auditory cues while walking on a treadmill, whereas the use of fast frequency cues during overground walking can facilitate faster walking speeds.","Wygand, M.; Chawla, G.; Browner, N.; Lewek, M.",20190809,"Rehabilitation Medicine And Physical Therapy","10.1101/19003251",1,"Michael Lewek","UNC-Chapel Hill","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19003251v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19003251v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"Data will be made available upon request."
158,"Individuals with Parkinson's Disease Retain Spatiotemporal Gait Control With Music and Metronome Cues","Background: Parkinson's disease (PD) is marked by a loss of motor automaticity, resulting in decreased control of step length during gait. Rhythmic auditory cues (metronomes or music) may enhance automaticity by adjusting cadence. Both metronomes and music may offer distinct advantages, but prior attempts at quantifying their influence on spatiotemporal aspects of gait have been confounded by altered gait speeds from overground walking. We hypothesized that when gait speed is fixed, individuals with PD would experience difficulty in modifying cadence due to the concomitant requirement to alter step length, with greater changes noted with metronomes compared to music cues. Research Question: Can a metronome or music promote spatiotemporal adjustments when decoupled from changes in gait speed in individuals with PD? Methods: 21 participants with PD were instructed to time their steps to a metronome and music cues (at 85%, 100%, and 115% of overground cadence) during treadmill walking. We calculated cadence, cadence accuracy, and step length during each cue condition and an uncued control condition. We compared the various cue frequencies and auditory modalities. Results: At fixed gait speeds, participants were able to increase and decrease cadence in response to auditory cues. Music and metronome cues produced comparable results in cadence manipulation with greater cadence errors noted at slower intended frequencies. Nevertheless, the induced cadence changes created a concomitant alteration in step length, with music and metronomes producing comparable changes. Notably, longer step lengths were induced with both music and metronome during slow frequency cueing. Significance: This important change conflicts with conventional prescriptive approaches, which advocate for faster cue frequencies, if applied on a treadmill. The music and metronome cues produced comparable changes to gait, suggesting that either cue may be effective at overcoming the shortened step lengths during treadmill walking if slower frequencies are used.","Chawla, G.; Wygand, M.; Browner, N.; Lewek, M.",20190730,"Rehabilitation Medicine And Physical Therapy","10.1101/19003269",1,"Michael Lewek","UNC-Chapel Hill","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19003269v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19003269v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"Data will be made available upon request."
215,"An Efficient and Robust Approach to Detect Auditory Evoked Responses using Adaptive Averaging","Objective: the auditory brainstem response is widely employed to evaluate hearing function of test subjects for both clinical and research purposes. Currently, hearing threshold estimation still relies on trained professionals to assess the audiograms, resulting in the largest cost component of the test. The objective of this study was to develop an automated approach to objectively and reliably detect the hearing thresholds. Design: From eight mice and four human participants, we recorded for each sound level hundreds of single sweeps and asked how many sweeps were minimum required for a response being detected from cumulative averages using correlation function. We named this procedure the adaptive averaging approach. Result: We found an exponential increase in the required sweeps at near-threshold sound levels, modeling of which allowed objective and precise threshold estimation. The results from mouse and human recordings deviated consistently less than 5 dB from the expert-assessed values. Moreover, up to 69 % sweeps at suprathreshold sound tests were found redundant for the threshold estimation and could be avoided to improve test efficiency. Conclusions: The adaptive averaging approach achieved objective and precise hearing threshold detection and implementation of this approach in commercial recording devices will automate the hearing test in a more reliable and cost-effective way.","Wang, H.; Ding, X.; Li, B.; Wang, X.; Huang, Z.; Hua, Y.; Wu, H.",20190813,"Otolaryngology","10.1101/19003301",1,"Yunfeng Hua","Ear Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19003301v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19003301v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"All data referred to in the manuscript are available."
159,"Toric Intraocular Lens Implantation in Cataract Patients with Corneal Opacity.","Aims: To evaluate the effect of toric intraocular lens implantation in cataract patient with corneal opacity and high astigmatism. Methods: 31 eyes of 31 patients who underwent cataract surgery with toric intraocular lens implantation were included. All patients had corneal opacity with regular astigmatism. Preoperative total corneal astigmatism was determined considering posterior astigmatism using a rotating Scheimpflug camera (Pentacam: Oculus, Wetzlar, Germany). At 2 months after toric intraocular lens implantation, we evaluated residual astigmatism, uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Results: Postoperative UCVA and BCVA (0.30 {+/-} 0.17, 0.22 {+/-} 0.16LogMAR) statistically improved compared to preoperative UCVA and BCVA (1.2 {+/-} 0.34, 1.1 {+/-} 0.30LogMAR, respectively) (P<0.01). Postoperative residual refractive astigmatism (1.2 {+/-} 0.35D) was statistically reduced compared to preoperative refractive astigmatism (2.4 {+/-} 0.65D) (P<0.05). Preoperative and postoperative total corneal astigmatism values were not statistically different. All cases achieved visual acuity were as good as or better than that preoperatively. The percentage of corneal opacity covering pupillary area had significant negative correlation with postoperative UCVA and BCVA (logMAR) (R=-0.88 P<0.00001 and R=-0.87 P<0.00001, respectively) Conclusion: Toric intraocular lens implantation can improve UCVA, BCVA, and refractive astigmatism in cataract patient with corneal opacity.

329,"Alcohol use and cognitive functioning in young adults: an observational and Mendelian randomisation study","Background and Aims: There have been few longitudinal studies of association between alcohol use and cognitive functioning in young people. We aimed to examine whether alcohol use is a causal risk factor for deficient cognitive functioning in young adults. Design: Linear regression was used to examine the relationship between longitudinal latent class patterns of binge drinking and subsequent cognitive functioning. Two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) tested evidence for the causal relationship between alcohol use and cognitive functioning. Setting: South West England. Participants: The observational study included 3,155 adolescents and their parents (fully adjusted models) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). Genetic instruments for alcohol use were based on almost 1,000,000 individuals from the GWAS & Sequencing Consortium of Alcohol and Nicotine use (GSCAN). Genome-wide association studies for cognitive outcomes were based on 2,500 individuals from ALSPAC. Measurements: Binge drinking was assessed at approximately 16, 17, 18, 21, and 23 years. Cognitive functioning comprised working memory, response inhibition, and emotion recognition assessed at 24 years of age. Ninety-nine independent genome-wide significant SNPs associated with number of drinks per week were used as the genetic instrument for alcohol consumption. Potential confounders were included in the observational analyses. Findings: Four binge drinking classes were identified: low-risk (41%), early-onset monthly (19%), adult frequent (23%), and early-onset frequent (17%). The association between early-onset frequent binge drinking and cognitive functioning: working memory (b=0.09, 95%CI=-0.10 to 0.28), response inhibition (b=0.70, 95%CI=-10.55 to 11.95), and emotion recognition (b=0.01, 95%CI=-0.01 to 0.02) in comparison to low-risk drinkers were inconclusive as to whether a difference was present. Two-sample MR analyses similarly provided little evidence that alcohol use is associated with deficits in working memory using the inverse variance weight (b=0.29, 95%CI=-0.42 to 0.99), response inhibition (b=-0.32, 95%CI=-1.04 to 0.39), and emotion recognition (b=0.03, 95%CI=-0.55 to 0.61). Conclusions: Binge drinking in adolescence and early adulthood may not be causally related to deficiencies in working memory, response inhibition, or emotion recognition in youths.","Mahedy, L.; Suddell, S.; Skirrow, C.; Wootton, R.; Fernandes, G.

172,"Smoking, DNA methylation and lung function: a Mendelian randomization analysis to investigate causal relationships","Whether smoking-associated DNA methylation has a causal effect on lung function has not been thoroughly evaluated. We investigated the causal effects of 474 smoking-associated CpGs on forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) in two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) using methylation quantitative trait loci and genome-wide association data for FEV1. We found evidence of a possible causal effect for DNA methylation on FEV1 at 18 CpGs (p<1.2x10-4). Replication analysis supported a causal effect at three CpGs (cg21201401 (ZGPAT), cg19758448 (PGAP3) and cg12616487 (AHNAK) (p<0.0028). DNA methylation did not clearly mediate the effect of smoking on FEV1, although DNA methylation at some sites may influence lung function via effects on smoking. Using multiple-trait colocalization, we found evidence of shared causal variants between lung function, gene expression and DNA methylation. Findings highlight potential therapeutic targets for improving lung function and possibly smoking cessation, although large, tissue-specific datasets are required to confirm these results.","Jamieson, E.; Korogolou-Linden, R.; Wootton, R.; Guyatt, A.; Battram, T.; Burrows, K.; Gaunt, T.; Tobin, M.; Munafo, M.; Davey Smith, G.; Tilling, K.; Relton, C.; Richardson, T.; Richmond, R.",20190802,"Genetic And Genomic Medicine","10.1101/19003335",1,"Rebecca Richmond","University of Bristol","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19003335v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19003335v1.full.pdf","cc_by",NA,"Please address correspondence and material requests to R.C.R."
192,"Increasing Heroin, Cocaine, and Buprenorphine Arrests Reported to the Maine Diversion Alert Program","Background: The opioid overdose crisis is especially pronounced in Maine. The Diversion Alert Program (DAP) was developed to combat illicit drug use and prescription drug diversion by facilitating communication between law enforcement and healthcare providers with the goal of limiting drug-related harms and criminal behaviors. Our objectives in this report were to analyze 2014-2017 DAP for: 1) trends in drug arrests and, 2) differences in arrests by offense, demographics (sex and age) and by region. Methods: Drug charges (N = 8,193, 31.3% female, age = 33.1 {+/-} 9.9) reported to the DAP were examined by year, demographics, and location. Results: The most common substances of the 10,064 unique arrests reported were heroin (N = 2,203, 21.9%), crack/cocaine (N = 945, 16.8%), buprenorphine (N = 812, 8.1%), and oxycodone (N = 747, 7.4%). While the overall number of arrests reported to the DAP declined in 2017, the proportion of arrests involving opioids (heroin, buprenorphine, or fentanyl) and stimulants (cocaine/crack cocaine, or methamphetamine), increased (p < .05). Women had significantly increased involvement in arrests involving sedatives and miscellaneous pharmaceuticals (e.g. gabapentin) while men had an elevation in stimulant arrests. Heroin accounted for a lower percentage of arrests among individuals age [&ge;] 60 (6.6%) relative to young-adults (18-29, 22.3%, p < .0001). Older-adults had significantly more arrests than younger-adults for oxycodone, hydrocodone, and marijuana. Conclusion: Heroin had the most arrests from 2014-2017. Buprenorphine, fentanyl and crack/cocaine arrests increased appreciably suggesting that improved treatment is needed to prevent further nonmedical use and overdoses. The Diversion Alert Program provided a unique data source for research, a harm-reduction tool for health care providers, and an informational resource for law enforcement.","Simpson, K. J.; Moran, M.

691,"Efficacy of a spatial repellent for control of malaria in Indonesia: a cluster-randomized controlled trial.","A cluster randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to estimate protective efficacy of a spatial repellent against malaria infection at Sumba, Indonesia. Following radical cure in 1,341 children aged [&ge;]6 months - [&le;]5 years in 24 clusters, households were given transfluthrin or placebo passive emanators (devices designed to release vaporized chemical). Monthly blood screening and biweekly human-landing mosquito catches were performed during 10-months baseline (June 2015 to March 2016) and a 24-month intervention period (April 2016 to April 2018). Screening detected 164 first-time infections and an accumulative total of 459 infections in 667 subjects in placebo-control households; and 134 first-time and 253 accumulative total infections among 665 subjects in active intervention households. The 24-cluster protective effect of 27.7% and 31.3%, for time to first-event and overall (total new) infections, respectively, was not statistically significant. Purportedly, this was due in part to zero to low incidence in some clusters, undermining the ability to detect a protective effect. Subgroup analysis of 19 clusters where at least one infection occurred during baseline showed 33.3% (p-value = 0.083) and 40.9% (p-value = 0.0236, statistically significant at the 1-sided 5% significance level) protective effect to first-infection and overall infections, respectively. Among 12 moderate- to high-risk clusters, a statistically significant decrease on infection by intervention was detected (60% protective efficacy). Primary entomological analysis of impact was inconclusive. While this study suggests spatial repellents prevent malaria, additional evidence is required to demonstrate the product class provides an operationally feasible and effective means of reducing malaria transmission.","Syafruddin, D.; Asih, P.

492,"The impact of reactive mass vaccination campaigns on measles outbreaks in the Katanga region, Democratic Republic of Congo","The Katanga region in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has been struck by repeated epidemics of measles. In many of the affected health zones, reactive mass vaccination campaigns were conducted in response to the outbreaks. Here, we attempted to determine how effective campaigns were in curtailing a large outbreak in 2015. Using a model of measles transmission we compared observed case numbers to a counterfactual of no campaigns, by first fitting a model to the data including the campaigns and then re-running this without vaccination. Focusing on eight of the 68 health zones in the Katanga region, we estimated the reactive campaigns to have reduced the size of the outbreaks by approximately 21,000 (IQR: 16,000--27,000; 95% CI: 8300--38,000), or 21% (IQR: 17%--25%, 95% CI: 9.3%--34%) of possible measles cases. There was considerable heterogeneity in the impact of campaigns, with campaigns startgin earlier after the start of an outbreak being more impactful. We further sought to establish whether the spatial pattern of the outbreak could have been determined in advance to help prioritise areas for vaccination campaigns and speed up the response. The best predictors of outbreak size among all the health zones were vaccination coverage derived from cluster surveys and outbreak size in 2010-13. This, combined with the fact that the vast majority of reported cases were in under-5 year olds, would suggest that there are systematic issues of undervaccination. If this was to continue, outbreaks would be expected to continue to occur in the affected health zones at regular intervals, mostly concentrated in under-5 year olds. Taken together, our findings suggest that while a strong routine vaccination regime remains the most effective means of measles control, it might be possible to improve the effectiveness of reactive campaigns by considering predictive factors to trigger a more targeted vaccination response.","Funk, S.; Takahashi, S.; Hellewell, J.; Gadroen, K.; Carrion-Martin, I.; Van Lenthe, M.; Rivette, K.; Dietrich, S.; Edmunds, W.

275,"Descriptive epidemiology of physical activity energy expenditure in UK adults. The Fenland Study.","Background: Physical activity (PA) plays a role in the prevention of a range of diseases including obesity and cardiometabolic disorders. Large population-based descriptive studies of PA, incorporating precise measurement, are needed to understand the relative burden of insufficient PA levels and to inform the tailoring of interventions. Combined heart and movement sensing enables the study of physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) and intensity distribution. We aimed to describe the sociodemographic correlates of PAEE and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in UK adults. Methods: The Fenland study is a population-based cohort study of 12,435 adults aged 29 to 64 years-old in Cambridgeshire, UK. Following individual calibration (treadmill), participants wore a combined heart rate and movement sensor continuously for 6 days in free-living, from which we derived PAEE (kJ{middle dot}day-1{middle dot}kg-1) and time in MVPA (>3 & >4 METs) in bouts greater than 1 minute and 10 minutes. Socio-demographic information was self-reported. Stratum-specific summary statistics and multivariable analyses were performed. Results: Women accumulated a mean(sd) 50(20) kJ{middle dot}day-1{middle dot}kg-1 of PAEE, and 83(67) and 33(39) minutes{middle dot}day-1 of 1-min bouted and 10-min bouted MVPA respectively. By contrast, men recorded 59(23) kJ{middle dot}day-1{middle dot}kg-1, 124(84) and 60(58) minutes{middle dot}day-1. Age and BMI were also important correlates of PA. Association with age was inverse in both sexes, more strongly so for PAEE than MVPA. Obese individuals accumulated less PA than their normal-weight counterparts whether considering PAEE or allometrically-scaled PAEE (-10 kJ{middle dot}day-1{middle dot}kg-1 vs kJ{middle dot}day-1{middle dot}kg-2/3 in men). Higher income and manual work were associated with higher PA; manual workers recorded 13-16 kJ{middle dot}kg-1{middle dot}day-1 more PAEE than sedentary counterparts. Overall, 86% of women and 96% of men accumulated 21.4 minutes{middle dot}day-1 of MVPA (>3 METs) on average (150 minutes per week). These values were 49% and 74% if only considering bouts >10 min (15% and 31% for >4 METs). Conclusions: PA varied by age, sex and BMI, and was higher in manual workers and those with higher incomes. Light physical activity was the main driver of PAEE; a component of PA that is currently not quantified as a target in UK guidelines.","Lindsay, T.; Westgate, K.; Wijndaele, K.; Hollidge, S.; Kerrison, N.; Forouhi, N.; Griffin, S.; Wareham, N.; Brage, S.",20190827,"Epidemiology","10.1101/19003442",1,"Soren Brage","MRC Epidemiology Unit, University of Cambridge","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19003442v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19003442v1.full.pdf","cc_no","10.1186/s12966-019-0882-6","The data used for this study is available upon request via the link below."

DATA SOURCES: Trials were captured by searching Embase and MEDLINE on July 27, 2015. STUDY SELECTION: Inclusion: 1) primary trial reports, 2) interventional trials, 3) human subjects, 4) phase 1 to phase 3, 5) trials of ixabepilone in monotherapy or combination therapy of 6) pre-licensure cancer indications. Exclusion: 1) secondary reports, 2) interim results, 3) meta-analyses, 4) retrospective/observational studies, 5) laboratory analyses (ex vivo tissues), 6) reviews, 7) letters, editorials, guidelines, interviews, abstract-only and poster presentations. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data were independently double-extracted and differences between coders were reconciled by discussion. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We measured risk using the number of drug-related adverse events that were grade 3 or higher, benefit by objective response rate and trial outcomes by whether studies met their primary endpoint with acceptable safety. RESULTS: We identified 39 publications of ixabepilone monotherapy and 23 primary publications of combination therapy, representing 5615 patients and 1598 patient-years of involvement over 11 years and involving 17 different malignancies. In total, 830 patients receiving ixabepilone experienced objective tumour response (16%, 95% CI 12.5%-20.1%), and 74 died from drug-related toxicites (2.2%, 95% CI 1.6%-2.9%). Responding indications and combinations were identified very quickly; thereafter, the search for additional responding indications or combinations did not lead to labelling additions. A total of 11 ""uninformative"" trials were found, representing 27% of studies testing efficacy, 208 grade 3-4 events and 226 patient-years of involvement (21% and 26% of the portfolio total, respectively). After the European Medicines Agency rejected ixabepilone for licensing, all further trial activity involving ixabepilone was pursued outside of Europe. DISCUSSION: Risk/benefit for patients who enrolled in trials of non-approved indications of ixabepilone did not improve over the course of the drug's development. Clinical value was discovered very quickly; however, a large fraction of trials were uninformative.","Carlisle, B.

664,"The development of competency frameworks in healthcare professions: a scoping review.","Background Competency frameworks serve many roles including outlining characteristics of a competent workforce, to provide clarity to complex constructs, to facilitate professional mobility, and to help structure analysis, evaluation or assessment of professional expertise. Given these roles and their relevance in the health professions, we sought to understand the methods and strategies used in the development of existing competency frameworks. Methods The Arksey and O'Malley framework was applied to undertake this scoping review. Six electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Scopus, and ERIC) and three grey literature sources (greylit.org, Trove and Google Scholar) were searched using keywords related to competency frameworks. Studies of all types were included that described the development of a competency framework in a healthcare profession. Studies were screened for inclusion, and data were extracted independently by two reviewers. Data synthesis was both quantitative and qualitative. Results Among 5,710 citations, 190 were selected for analysis. The majority of studies were conducted in medicine and nursing professions. Group techniques were utilised in 140 studies (74%), literature reviews were conducted in 112 (59%), and 81 (43%) outlined some form of stakeholder deliberation. We found a significant degree of diversity in methodological strategies, inconsistent adherence to existing guidance on the selection of methods, who was involved, and based on the variation we observed in timeframes, form, choice, sequence, combination, function, application and reporting of methods and strategies, there is no apparent gold standard or standardised approach to competency framework development. Conclusions This review observed significant variation within the conduct and reporting of the competency framework development process. Such variation is a cause for concern, potentially resulting in the development of frameworks that may not have captured the complexities of clinical practice, which are therefore of limited value to the profession, and may unwillingly create and legitimise artificial outcomes. The results of this review suggest there is a need for improved guidance in the process for developing and reporting competency frameworks.","Batt, A.

183,"Investigating the attitudes of Canadian paramedic students towards homelessness.","Introduction: When paramedics are dispatched, it is expected that every patient receives the same level of care regardless of variable factors. Homelessness is a growing social issue across Canada that is particularly prevalent in urban areas. The quality of healthcare delivered to individuals experiencing homelessness may be influenced by negative attitudes held by healthcare professionals. There is an absence of literature quantifying the perspectives of paramedics towards homelessness; therefore, the focus of this study was to identify the attitudes of paramedic students towards homelessness and to continue the conversation in regards to the evolving educational needs of paramedic students. Methods: This study employed a longitudinal design of a convenience sample of first year paramedic students in a college program in Ontario, Canada. The Health Professional's Attitude Towards the Homeless Inventory (HPATHI) was distributed to participants before and after placement and clinical exposure. The questionnaire includes 19 statements which participants respond to on a Likert scale. Mean scores were calculated, and statements were categorized into attitudes, interest, and confidence. Data were collected post-placement on interactions with persons experiencing homelessness. Results: A total of 52 first year paramedic students completed the HPATHI pre-placement and 47 completed the questionnaire post-placement. Mean scores for attitudes (pre 3.64, SD 0.49; post 3.85, SD 0.38, p=0.032), interest (pre 3.91, SD 0.40; post 3.84, SD 0.39,p=0.51) and confidence (pre 4.02, SD 0.50; post 3.71, SD 0.67, p=0.004) were largely positive, but there was a demonstrated decreasing trend in confidence with, and interest in, working with those experiencing homelessness. Participants reported an average of 60 hours of placement, during which 15 participants (32%) reported interactions with people experiencing homelessness. Conclusion: First year paramedic students demonstrate overall positive attitudes towards those experiencing homelessness, and the mean score for attitudes improved over the surveys. However, there were demonstrable decreases in confidence and interest over time, which may be related to the type and frequency of interactions during clinical placement. Paramedic education programs may benefit from the inclusion of focused education on homelessness, specific clinical experiences, and education related to social determinants of health.","Cochrane, A.; Pithia, P.; Laird, E.; Mifflin, K.; Sonley-Long, V.; Batt, A.

761,"The effects of stress on the driving abilities of paramedic students - a pilot, simulator-based study.","Background Previous research has suggested that stress may have a negative effect on the clinical performance of paramedics. In addition, stress has been demonstrated to have a negative impact the driving abilities of the general population, increasing the number of driving errors. However, to date no studies have explored stress and its potential impact on non-clinical performance of paramedics, particularly their driving abilities. Methods Paramedic students underwent emergency driving assessment in a driving simulator before and after exposure to a stressful medical scenario. Number and type of errors were documented before and after by both driving simulator software and observation by two observers from the research team. The NASA Task Load Index (TLX) was utilised to record self-reported stress levels. Results 36 students participated in the study. Following exposure to a stressful medical scenario, paramedic students demonstrated no increase in overall error rate, but demonstrated an increase in three critical driving errors, namely failure to wear a seatbelt (3 baseline v 10 post stress), failing to stop for red lights or stop signs (7 v 35), and losing control of the vehicle (2 v 11). Self-reported stress levels also increased after the clinical scenario, particularly in the area of mental (cognitive) demand. Conclusion Paramedics are routinely exposed to acute stress in their everyday work, and this stress could affect their non-clinical performance. The critical errors committed by participants in this study closely matched those considered to be contributory factors in many ambulance collisions. These results stimulate the need for further research into the effects of stress on non-clinical performance in general, and highlight the potential need to consider additional driver training and stress management education in order to mitigate the frequency and severity of driving errors.","Hines Duncliffe, T.; D'angelo, B.; Brock, M.; Fraser, C.; Lamarra, J.; Austin, N.; Pusateri, M.; Batt, A.

414,"Risk factors for heart failure with preserved or reduced ejection fraction among Medicare beneficiaries: Applications of competing risks analysis and gradient boosted model.","Background: The differential impact of various demographic characteristics and comorbid conditions on development of heart failure (HF) with preserved (pEF) and reduced ejection fraction (rEF) is not well studied among the elderly. Methods and Results: Using Medicare claims data linked to electronic health records, we conducted an observational cohort study of individuals [&ge;] 65 years of age without HF. A Cox proportional hazards model accounting for competing risk of HFrEF and HFpEF incidence was constructed. A gradient boosted model (GBM) assessed the relative influence (RI) of each predictor in development of HFrEF and HFpEF. Among 138,388 included individuals, 9,701 developed HF (IR= 20.9 per 1,000 person-year). Males were more likely to develop HFrEF than HFpEF (HR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.81-2.37 vs. 1.11, 95% CI: 1.02-1.20, P for heterogeneity < 0.01). Atrial fibrillation and pulmonary hypertension had stronger associations with the risk of HFpEF (HR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.80-2.26 and 1.66, 95% CI: 1.23-2.22) while cardiomyopathy and myocardial infarction were more strongly associated with HFrEF (HR = 4.37, 95% CI: 3.21-5.97 and 1.94, 95% CI: 1.23-3.07). Age was the strongest predictor across all HF subtypes with RI from GBM >35%. Atrial fibrillation was the most influential comorbidity for development of HFpEF (RI = 8.4%) while cardiomyopathy was most influential for HFrEF (RI = 20.7%). Conclusions: These findings of heterogeneous relationships between several important risk factors and heart failure types underline the potential differences in the etiology of HFpEF and HFrEF.","Lee, M.

161,"Incubation periods impact the spatial predictability of outbreaks: analysis of cholera and Ebola outbreaks in Sierra Leone","Forecasting the spatiotemporal spread of infectious diseases during an outbreak is an important component of epidemic response. However, it remains challenging both methodologically and with respect to data requirements as disease spread is influenced by numerous factors, including the pathogen's underlying transmission parameters and epidemiological dynamics, social networks and population connectivity, and environmental conditions. Here, using data from Sierra Leone we analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of recent cholera and Ebola outbreaks and compare and contrast the spread of these two pathogens in the same population. We develop a simulation model of the spatial spread of an epidemic in order to examine the impact of a pathogen's incubation period on the dynamics of spread and the predictability of outbreaks. We find that differences in the incubation period alone can determine the limits of predictability for diseases with different natural history, both empirically and in our simulations. Our results show that diseases with longer incubation periods, such as Ebola, where infected individuals can travel further before becoming infectious, result in more long-distance sparking events and less predictable disease trajectories, as compared to the more predictable wave-like spread of diseases with shorter incubation periods, such as cholera.","Kahn, R.; Peak, C.

200,"Examining Gender Differences in Opioid, Benzodiazepine, and Antibiotic Prescribing","While gender differences have been explored across several areas of medicine, our study is the first to present a systematic comparison of drug prescribing behavior of male and female providers, including opioid, benzodiazepine, and antibiotic prescribing. Our work is of particular relevance to the current opioid crisis and other iatrogenic harms related to injudicious prescribing. Our objective is to explore prescribing differences between male and female providers across medical specialties and for different prescription drug categories in Medicare Part D. To this end, we performed a descriptive, retrospective study of 1.13 million medical providers who made drug claims to Medicare Part D in 2016, analyzing gender, specialty, and drug category. We found that male providers across diverse specialties prescribe significantly more medications, including opioids, benzodiazepines, and antibiotics than female providers by volume, cost, and per patient. These observed gender differences in prescribing, while agnostic to the quality of care provided, nonetheless inform the design of prevention strategies that seek to reduce iatrogenic harms related to prescribing.","Hamamsy, T.; Tamang, S.; Lembke, A.",20190812,"Health Informatics","10.1101/19003533",1,"Tymor Hamamsy","New York University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19003533v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19003533v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"The data used for this study is publicly available and hosted by CMS."
173,"Effectiveness of four oral antifungal drugs (fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole, terbinafine) in current epidemic of altered dermatophytosis in India: A randomized pragmatic trial","Background: Dermatophyte infections have undergone unprecedented changes in India in recent past. Clinical trials comparing effectiveness of 4 main oral antifungal drugs are not available. We tested effectiveness of oral fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole and terbinafine in chronic and chronic-relapsing tinea corporis, tinea cruris and tinea faciei. Methods: Two hundred microscopy confirmed patients were allocated to 4 groups, fluconazole (5mg/kg/day), griseofulvin (10 mg/kg/day), itraconazole (5mg/kg/day), and terbinafine (7.5mg/kg/day), by concealed block randomization and treated for 8 weeks or cure. Effectiveness was calculated based on intention to treat analysis. Results: At 4 weeks, 4, 1, 2, and 4 patients were cured with fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole and terbinafine, respectively (P=0.417). At 8 weeks, 21 (42%), 7 (14%), 33 (66%) and 14 (28%) patients were cured, respectively (P=0.000); itraconazole was superior to fluconazole, griseofulvin and terbinafine (P[&le;]0.016). Relapse rates after 4 and 8 weeks of cure in different groups were similar. Numbers-needed-to-treat (NNT) (versus griseofulvin), calculated based on cure rates at 8 weeks, for itraconazole, fluconazole, and terbinafine were 2, 4 and 8, respectively. Conclusion: In view of cure rates and NNT, itraconazole is the most effective drug, followed by fluconazole (daily), terbinafine and then griseofulvin, in chronic and chronic-relapsing dermatophytosis in India.","Singh, S.; Chandra, U.; Verma, P.; Anchan, V.

174,"A phenome-wide analysis of short- and long-run disease incidence following Recurrent Pregnancy Loss using data from a 39-year period","Background: Pregnancy loss is one of the most frequent pregnancy complications. It is unclear how recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) impacts disease risk later in life and if later disease risk is different in women with or without a live birth prior to RPL (primary vs. secondary RPL). We sought to investigate if women have an increased risk of disease following RPL, and if there was a difference between primary and secondary RPL. Methods: Using population-wide health care registry databases from Denmark we identified a cohort of 1,370,896 women between 12 and 40 years in the period January 1, 1977, to October 5, 2016 who had been pregnant. Each woman was followed on average for 15.8 years. Of these, 10,691 (0.77%) women fulfilled the criteria for RPL (50.0% had primary RPL). Relative Risk Ratios (RR) were calculated in a phenome-wide manner for diagnoses with a cumulative incidence proportion [&ge;]0.1% in women with RPL. Diagnoses related to assessment and diagnosis of RPL and those appearing later in life were separated using a Mixture Model. Results: In the full cohort of pregnant women, 0.77% (10,691) fulfilled the criteria for RPL (50.0% primary RPL). Compared to women without RPL, primary RPL increased the risk of subsequent cardiovascular disorders, including atherosclerosis (RR=2.45, 1.65-3.51 95% Uncertainty Interval (UI)), cerebral infarction (RR=1.87, 1.43-2.4 95% UI), heart failure (RR=1.97, 1.44-2.63 95% UI), and pulmonary embolism (RR=1.82, 1.32-2.46 95% UI). Women with secondary RPL had an increased risk of obstetric complications, e.g. placenta previa (RR=3.76, 2.9-4.8 95% UI), premature rupture of membrane (RR=2.55, 2.21-2.91 95% UI), intrapartum hemorrhage (RR=2.8, 1.77-4.31 95% UI), gestational hypertension (RR=2.2, 1.67-2.87 95% UI), and puerperal sepsis (RR=2.54, 1.8-3.5 95% UI). We also noticed associations to autoimmune, respiratory, gastro-intestinal and mental disorders in both subtypes. Conclusion: Our findings show that RPL is a risk factor for a spectrum of disorders. This can in part be due to increased screening following RPL, but it also suggests that RPL may directly influence or share etiology with a number of diseases later in life. Research into the pathophysiology of both pregnancy loss and later diseases merits further investigation.","Westergaard, D.; Nielsen, A. P.; Mortensen, L. H.; Nielsen, H.

In Zambia, it is estimated that over 72,000 children have HIV infection, and despite access to combination antiretroviral therapy, many will experience HIV-associated neurocognitive deficits (HAND) encompassing cognitive and psychiatric sequelae such as global intellectual delay, executive dysfunction, and depressed mood. However, little is known about the neurocognitive profile of such children, the long-term outcomes and impacts of HAND, or the predictors and risk factors for HAND-related impairment. We have initiated the first-ever prospective, longitudinal study of neurocognition in children with HIV-infection in Zambia. Our overarching study goals are to validate cognitive and psychiatric testing tools in children with HIV infection in Zambia, and to determine if inflammatory biomarkers and brain imaging can prospectively identify children at high risk of developing HAND.

202,"Depletion-of-susceptibles bias in influenza vaccine waning studies: how to ensure robust results","Vaccine effectiveness (VE) studies are subject to biases due to depletion of at-risk persons or of highly susceptible persons at different rates from different groups (depletion-of-susceptibles bias), a problem that can also lead to biased estimates of waning effectiveness, including spurious inference of waning when none exists. An alternative study design to identify waning is to study only vaccinated persons, and compare for each day the incidence in persons with earlier or later dates of vaccination. Prior studies suggested under what conditions this alternative would yield correct estimates of waning. Here we define the depletion-of-susceptibles process formally and show mathematically that for influenza vaccine waning studies, a randomized trial or corresponding observational study that compares incidence at a specific calendar time among individuals vaccinated at different times before the influenza season begins will not be vulnerable depletion-of-susceptibles bias in its inference of waning under the null hypothesis that none exists, and will - if waning does actually occur - underestimate the extent of waning. Such a design is thus robust in the sense that a finding of waning in that inference framework reflects actual waning of vaccine-induced immunity. We recommend such a design for future studies of waning, whether observational or randomized.","Lipsitch, M.; Goldstein, E. M.; Ray, G.

175,"Eating behavior trajectories in the first ten years of life and their relationship with BMI","Background: Child eating behaviors (EBs) are highly heterogeneous and their longitudinal impact on childhood weight is unclear. The objective of this study was to characterize EBs during the first ten years of life and evaluate associations with BMI at age 11 years. Method: Data were parental reports of EBs from birth to age 10 years and standardized body mass index (zBMI) at age 11 years (n=12,048) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Latent class growth analysis was used to derive latent classes of over-, under-, and fussy eating. Linear regression models for zBMI at 11 years on each set of classes were fitted to assess associations with EBs trajectories. Results: We identified four classes of overeating; low stable (70%), low transient (15%), late increasing (11%), and early increasing (6%). The early increasing class was associated with higher zBMI (boys: {beta}=0.83, 95%CI:0.65, 1.02; girls: {beta}=1.1; 0.92, 1.28) compared to low stable. Six classes were found for undereating; low stable (25%), low transient (37%), low decreasing (21%), high transient (11%), high decreasing (4%), and high stable (2%). The latter was associated with lower zBMI (boys: {beta}=-0.79; -1.15, -0.42; girls: {beta}=-0.76; -1.06, -0.45). Six classes were found for fussy eating; low stable (23%), low transient (15%), low increasing (28%), high decreasing (14%), low increasing (13%), high stable (8%). The high stable class was associated with lower zBMI (boys: {beta} =-0.49; -0.68 -0.30; girls: {beta} =-0.35; -0.52, -0.18). Conclusions: Early increasing overeating during childhood is associated with higher zBMI at age 11. High persistent levels of undereating and fussy eating are associated with lower zBMI. Longitudinal trajectories of EBs may help identify children potentially at risk of adverse weight outcomes.","Herle, M.; De Stavola, B.; Huebel, C.; Santos Ferreira, D.; Abdulkadir, M.; Yilmaz, Z.; Loos, R.; Bryant-Waugh, R.; Bulik, C.; Micali, N.",20190802,"Pediatrics","10.1101/19003665",1,"Nadia Micali","University College London","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19003665v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19003665v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"ALSPAC data access is through a system of managed open access.

226,"Redefining the Bladder Cancer Phenotype using Patterns of Familial Risk","Relatives of bladder cancer (BCa) patients have been shown to be at increased risk for kidney, lung, thyroid, and cervical cancer after correcting for smoking related behaviors that may concentrate in some families. We demonstrate a new method to simultaneously assess risks for multiple cancers to identify distinct multi-cancer configurations (multiple different cancer types that cluster in relatives) surrounding BCa patients. We identified 6,416 individuals with urothelial carcinoma and familial information using the Utah Cancer Registry and Utah Population Database (UPDB). First-degree relatives, second-degree relatives, and first cousins were used to construct a familial enrichment matrix for cancer-types previously shown to be individually associated with BCa. K-medioids clustering were used to identify Familial Multi-Cancer Configurations (FMC). A case-control design and Cox regression with a 1:5 ratio of BCa cases to cancer-free controls was used to quantify the risk in specific relative-types and spouses in each FMC. Clustering analysis revealed 12 distinct FMCs, each exhibiting a different pattern of cancer co-aggregation. Of the 12 FMCs, four exhibited strong familial risk of bladder cancer along with specific patterns of increased risk of cancers in other sites (BCa FMCs), and were the focus of further investigation. Cancers at increased risk in these four BCa FMCs most commonly included melanoma, prostate and breast cancer and less commonly included leukemia, lung, pancreas and kidney cancer. A network-based approach can be used with familial data to discover new phenotype clusters for BCa, providing new directions for discovering patterns of cancer clustering.","Hanson, H. A.; Leiser, C.

In the present study, we systematically analyzed the role of TIICs in EMC development. Methods: Patient data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We comprehensively analyzed TIIC population in EMC tissue and their role in EMC progression and prognosis by using a deconvolution algorithm (CIBERSORT) and clinically annotated expression profiles. Results: The proportions of gamma delta T cells, resting NK cells, M1 macrophages, and resting mast cells were significantly different in normal endometrium and EMC tissue. The proportion of CD8+ T cells, resting memory CD4 T cells, and M0 macrophages was reversed middle correlated. The proportion of resting dendritic cells, resting memory CD4 T cells, and T regulatory cells (Tregs) decreased in accordance with the cancer cell differentiation grade (G); the lower proportion of activated dendritic cells and gamma delta T cells and higher proportion of Tregs predicted longer EMC survival time and vice versa. The low proportion of gamma delta T cells indicated better response to therapy. Conclusion: Collectively, our data suggested subtle differences in the cellular composition of TIICs in EMC, and these differences were likely to be important determinants of both prognosis and therapy of EMC.","Zhou, X.; Ling, Z.; Yang, B.",20190829,"Obstetrics And Gynecology","10.1101/19003707",1,"Bing Yang","The First Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19003707v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19003707v1.full.pdf","cc0_ng",NA,"All related data are available if needed."
222,"Elucidating user behaviours in a digital health surveillance system to correct prevalence estimates","Estimating seasonal influenza prevalence is of undeniable public health importance, but remains challenging with traditional datasets due to cost and timeliness. Digital epidemiology has the potential to address this challenge, but can introduce sampling biases that are distinct to traditional systems. In online participatory health surveillance systems, the voluntary nature of the data generating process must be considered to address potential biases in estimates. Here we examine user behaviours in one such platform, FluTracking, from 2011 to 2017. We build a Bayesian model to estimate probabilities of an individual reporting in each week, given their past reporting behaviour, and to infer the weekly prevalence of influenza-like-illness (ILI) in Australia. We show that a model that corrects for user behaviour can substantially effect ILI estimates. The model examined here elucidates several factors, such as the status of having ILI and consistency of prior reporting, that are strongly associated with the likelihood of participating in online health surveillance systems. This framework could be applied to other digital participatory health systems where participation is inconsistent and sampling bias may be of concern.","Liu, D.; Mitchell, L.; Cope, R.

177,"Role of miRNAs induced by oxidized low-density lipoproteins in coronary artery disease: the REGICOR Study.","Aims: Current risk prediction tools are not accurate enough to identify most individuals at high coronary risk. On the other hand, oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ox-LDLs) and miRNAs are actively involved in atherosclerosis. Our aim was to examine the association of ox-LDL-induced miRNAs with coronary artery disease (CAD), and to assess their predictive capacity of future CAD. Methods and results: Human endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells were treated with oxidized or native LDLs (nLDL), and their miRNA expression was measured with the miRNA 4.0 array, and analyzed with moderated t-tests. Differently expressed miRNAs and others known to be associated with CAD, were examined in serum samples of 500 acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients and 500 healthy controls, and baseline serum of 117 incident CAD cases and c 485 randomly-selected cohort participants (case-cohort). Both were developed within the REGICOR AMI Registry and population cohorts from Girona. miRNAs expression in serum was measured with custom OpenArray plates, and analyzed with fold change (age and sex-paired case-control) and survival models (case-cohort). Improvement in discrimination and reclassification by miRNAs was assessed. Twenty-one miRNAs were up- or down-regulated with ox-LDL in cell cultures. One of them, 1 (has-miR-122-5p, fold change=4.85) was upregulated in AMI cases. Of the 28 known CAD-associated miRNAs, 11 were upregulated in AMI cases, and 1 (hsa-miR-143-3p, hazard ratio=0.56 [0.38-0.82]) was associated with CAD incidence and improved reclassification. Conclusion: We identified 2 novel miRNAs associated with ox-LDLs (hsa-miR-193b-5p and hsa-miR-1229-5p), and 1 miRNA that improved reclassification of healthy individuals (hsa-miR-143-3p).","Degano, I.

247,"Health literacy, cognitive ability and self-reported diabetes in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing","Objective: To examine the association of health literacy and cognitive ability with risk of diabetes. Research Design and Methods: Participants were 8,669 English Longitudinal Study of Ageing participants (mean age 66.7 years, SD 9.7) who completed health literacy and cognitive ability tests at wave 2 (2004-2005), and who answered a self-reported question on whether a doctor had ever diagnosed them with diabetes. Logistic regression was used to examine the cross-sectional associations of health literacy and cognitive ability with diabetes status. In those without diabetes at wave 2, Cox regression was used to test the associations of health literacy and cognitive ability with risk of diabetes over a median of 9.5 years follow-up (n=6,961). Results: Adequate (compared to limited) health literacy (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61-0.84) and higher cognitive ability (OR per 1 SD 0.73, CI 0.67-0.80) were both associated with lower odds of self-reported diabetes. Adequate health literacy (HR 0.64; CI 0.53-0.77) and higher cognitive ability (HR 0.77, CI 0.69-0.85) were also associated with lower risk of self-reporting diabetes during follow-up. When both health literacy and cognitive ability were added to the same model, these associations were slightly attenuated. Additional adjustment for health behaviours, education and social class attenuated associations further, and neither health literacy nor cognitive ability were significantly associated with diabetes. Conclusions: Adequate health literacy and better cognitive ability were associated with reduced risk of diabetes. These associations were independent of each other, but not of other health- and socioeconomic-related variables.","Fawns-Ritchie, C.; Price, J.; Deary, I.

We aimed to examine the associations of childcare type, duration, and intensity with BMI trajectories from ages 10-42 years. Methods: The sample comprised 8234 individuals in the 1970 British Cohort Study, who had data on childcare attendance (no, yes), type (formal, informal), duration (4-5, 3-3.99, 0-2.99 years old when started), and intensity (1, 2, 3, 4-5 days/week) reported at age five years and 32563 BMI observations. Multilevel linear spline models were used to estimate the association of each exposure with the sample-average BMI trajectory, with covariate adjustment. A combined duration and intensity exposure was also examined. Results: Childcare attendance and type were not strongly related to BMI trajectories. Among participants who attended childcare 1-2 days a week, those who started when 3-3.99 years old had a 0.197 (-0.004, 0.399) kg/m2 higher BMI at age 10 years than those who started when 4-5 years old, and those who started when 0-2.99 years old had a 0.289 (0.049, 0.529) kg/m2 higher BMI. A similar dose-response pattern for intensity was observed when holding duration constant. By age 42 years, individuals who started childcare at age 0-2.99 years and attended 3-5 days/week had a 1.356 kg/m2 (0.637, 2.075) higher BMI than individuals who started at age 4-5 years and attended 1-2 days/week. Conclusions: Children who start childcare earlier and/ or attend more frequently may have greater long-term obesity risk.","Costa, S.; Bann, D.; Benjamin-Neelon, S.

199,"A flexible formula for incorporating distributive concerns into cost-effectiveness analyses: priority weights","Cost effectiveness analyses (CEAs) are widely used to evaluate the opportunity cost of health care investments. However, few functions that take equity concerns into account are available for such CEA methods, and these concerns are therefore at risk of being disregarded. Among the functions that have been developed, most focus on the distribution of health gains, as opposed to the distribution of lifetime health. This is despite the fact that there are good reasons to give higher priority to individuals and groups with a low health adjusted life expectancy. Also, an even distribution of health gains may imply an uneven distribution of lifetime health. We develop a systematic and explicit approach that allows for the inclusion of lifetime health concerns in CEAs, by creating a new priority weight function, PW=+(t-{gamma}){middle dot}C{middle dot}e-{beta}{middle dot}(t-{gamma}), where t is the health measure. PW has several desirable properties. First, it is continuous and smooth, ensuring that people with similar health characteristics are treated alike. Second, it is flexible regarding shape and outcome measure, so that a broad range of values may be modelled. Third, the coefficients have distinct roles. This allows for the easy manipulation of the PW's shape. In order to demonstrate how PW may be applied, we use data from a previous study and estimated the coefficients of PW based on two approaches. The first considers the mean weights assigned by the respondents: PWmean=-0.42+(t+22.2){middle dot}0.27{middle dot}e-0.031{middle dot}(t+22.2) . The second considers the median weights: PWmedian=0.79+(t+8.85){middle dot}0.17{middle dot}e-0.053{middle dot}(t+8.85) . This illustrates that our framework allows for the estimation of PWs based on empirical data.","Haaland, O. A.; Lindemark, F.; Johansson, K.

176,"Characteristics of Patients that Substitute Medical Cannabis for Alcohol","Aims. A substitution effect occurs when patients substitute Medical Cannabis (MC) for another drug. Over three-quarters (76.7%) of New England dispensary members reported reducing their use of opioids and two-fifths (42.0%) decreased their use of alcohol after starting MC (Piper et al. 2017). The objective of this exploratory study was to identify any factors which differentiate alcohol substituters from those that do not modify their alcohol use after starting MC (non-substituters). Methods. Among dispensary patients (N=1,477), over two-thirds with chronic pain, that completed an online survey, 7.4% indicated that they regularly consumed alcohol. Comparisons were made to identify any demographic or health history characteristics which differentiated alcohol substituters (N=47) from non-substituters (N=65). Respondents selected from among a list of 37 diseases and health conditions (e.g. diabetes, sleep disorders) and the total number was calculated. Results. Substituters and non-substituters were indistinguishable in terms of sex, age, or prior drug history. Substituters were significantly more likely to be employed (68.1%) than non-substituters (51.1%). Substituters also reported having significantly more health conditions and diseases (3.3+2.0) than non-substituters (2.4+1.4). Conclusions. This small study offers some insights into the profile of patients whose self-reported alcohol intake decreased following initiation of MC. Alcohol substituters had more other health conditions but also were more likely to be employed which may indicate that they fit a social drinker profile. Additional prospective or controlled research into the alcohol substitution effect following MC with a sample with more advanced alcohol misuse may be warranted.","Hayat, A.; Piper, B.

223,"Measuring Baseline Health with Individual Health-Adjusted Life Expectancy (iHALE)","Objectives: At any point of time, a person's baseline health is the number of healthy life years they are expected to experience during the course of their lifetime. In this article we propose an equity-relevant health metric, illness-specific individual Health Adjusted Life Expectancy (iHALE), that facilitates comparison of baseline health for individuals at the onset of different medical conditions, and allows for the assessment of which patient groups are worse off. A method for calculating iHALE is presented, and we use this method to rank four conditions in six countries according to several criteria of ""worse off"" as a proof of concept. Methods: iHALE measures baseline health at an individual level for specific conditions, and consists of two components: past health (before disease onset) and future expected health (after disease onset). Four conditions (acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), schizophrenia, and epilepsy) are analysed in six countries (Ethiopia, Haiti, China, Mexico, United States and Japan). Data for all countries and for all diseases in 2017 were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study database. In order to assess who are the worse off, we focus on four measures: the proportion of affected individuals who are expected to attain less than 20 healthy life years (T20), the 25th and 75th percentiles of healthy life years for affected individuals (Q1 and Q3, respectively), and the average iHALE across all affected individuals. Results: Even in settings where average iHALE is similar for two conditions, other measures may vary. One example is AML (average iHALE=58.7, T20=2.1, Q3-Q1=15.3) and ALL (57.7, T20=4.7, Q3-Q1=21.8) in the US. Many illnesses, such as epilepsy, are associated with higher baseline health in high-income settings (average iHALE in Japan=64.3) than in low-income settings (average iHALE in Ethiopia=36.8). Conclusion: iHALE allows for the estimation of the distribution of baseline health of all individuals in a population. Hence, baseline health can be incorporated as an equity consideration in setting priorities for health interventions.","Johansson, K. A.; Okland, J.-M.; Skaftun, E. K.; Bukhman, G.; Norheim, O.

178,"Meat intake and cancer risk: prospective analyses in UK Biobank","Background: Red and processed meat has been consistently associated with risk for colorectal cancer, but evidence for other cancer sites is limited and few studies have examined the association between poultry intake and cancer risk. We examined associations between total meat, red meat, processed meat and poultry intake and incidence for 20 common cancer sites. Methods and Findings: We analysed data from 475,023 participants (54% women) in UK Biobank. Participants were aged 37 73 years and cancer free at baseline. Information on meat consumption was based on a touchscreen questionnaire completed at baseline covering type and frequency of meat intake. Diet intake was re-measured a minimum of three times in a subsample (15%) using a web-based 24h dietary recall questionnaire. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the association between baseline meat intake and cancer incidence. Trends in risk across baseline meat intake categories were calculated by assigning a mean value to each category using estimates from the re-measured meat intakes. During a mean follow-up of 6.9 years, 28,955 participants were diagnosed with a malignant cancer. Total, red and processed meat intakes were each positively associated with risk of colorectal cancer (e.g. hazard ratio (HR) per 70 g/day higher intake of red and processed meat combined 1.31, 95%-confidence interval (CI) 1.14-1.52). Red meat intake was positively associated with breast cancer (HR per 50 g/day higher intake 1.12, 1.01-1.24) and prostate cancer (1.15, 1.03-1.29). Poultry intake was positively associated with risk for cancers of the lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues (HR per 30g/day higher intake 1.16, 1.03-1.32). Only the associations with colorectal cancer were robust to Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Study limitations include unrepresentativeness of the study sample for the UK population, low case numbers for less common cancers and the possibility of residual confounding. Conclusions: Higher intakes of red and processed meat were associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer. The observed positive associations of red meat consumption with breast and prostate cancer, and poultry intake with cancers of the lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues, require further investigation.","Knuppel, A.; Papier, K.; Fensom, G.

804,"Assessment of Bias in Estimates of Sexual Network Degree using Prospective Cohort Data","Background: Sexual network degree, a count of ongoing partnerships, plays a critical role in the transmission dynamics of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections (STI). Researchers often quantify degree using self-reported cross-sectional data on the day of survey, which may result in bias because of uncertainty about future sexual activity. Methods: We evaluated the bias of a cross-sectional degree measure with a prospective cohort study of men who have sex with men (MSM). At baseline, we asked men about whether recent sexual partnerships were ongoing. We confirmed the true, ongoing status of those partnerships at baseline at follow-up. With logistic regression, we estimated the partnership-level predictors of baseline measure accuracy. With Poisson regression, we estimated the longitudinally confirmed degree as a function of baseline predicted degree. Results: Across partnership types, the baseline ongoing status measure was 70% accurate, with higher negative predictive value (91%) than positive predictive value (39%). Partnership exclusivity and racial pairing were associated with higher accuracy. Baseline degree generally overestimated confirmed degree. Bias, or number of ongoing partners different than predicted at baseline, was -0.28 overall, ranging from -1.91 to -0.41 for MSM with any ongoing partnerships at baseline. Comparing MSM of the same baseline degree, the level of bias was stronger for black compared to white MSM, and for younger compared to older MSM. Conclusions: Research studies may overestimate degree when it is quantified cross-sectionally. Adjustment and structured sensitivity analyses may account for bias in studies of HIV or STI prevention interventions.","Uong, S.; Rosenberg, E. S.; Goodreau, S. M.; Luisi, N.; Sullivan, P.

224,"Diet-derived fruit and vegetable metabolites suggest sex-specific mechanisms conferring protection against osteoporosis in humans","The impact of nutrition on the metabolic profile of osteoporosis is incompletely characterized. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to detangle the association of fruit and vegetable (FV) intakes with osteoporosis prevalence. Dietary, anthropometric and blood plasma metabolite data were examined from the Boston Puerto Rican Osteoporosis Study, a cohort of 600 individuals (age 46-79yr). High FV intake was protective against osteoporosis prevalence (Odds Ratio=0.73; 95% CI = 0.57, 0.94; P=0.013). Associations of 525 plasma metabolites were assessed with fruit and vegetable intake, and separately with osteoporosis status. Several biological processes affiliated with the FV-associating metabolites, including caffeine metabolism, carnitines and fatty acids, and glycerophospholipids. For osteoporosis-associated metabolites, important processes were steroid hormone biosynthesis in women, and branched-chain amino acid metabolism in men. In all instances, the metabolite patterns differed greatly between sexes, arguing for a stratified nutrition approach in recommending FV intakes to improve bone health. Factors derived from principal components analysis of the FV intakes were correlated with the osteoporosis-associated metabolites, with high intake of dark leafy greens and berries/melons appearing protective in both sexes. These data warrant investigation into whether increasing intakes of dark leafy greens, berries and melons causally affect bone turnover and BMD among adults at risk for osteoporosis via sex-specific metabolic pathways, and how gene-diet interactions alter these sex-specific metabolomic-osteoporosis links.","Mangano, K.

296,"Identifying 31 novel breast cancer susceptibility loci using data from genome-wide association studies conducted in Asian and European women","Common genetic variants in 183 loci have been identified in relation to breast cancer risk in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These risk variants combined explain only a relatively small proportion of breast cancer heritability, particularly in Asian populations. To search for additional genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer, we performed a meta-analysis of data from GWAS conducted in Asians (24,206 cases and 24,775 controls). Variants showing an association with breast cancer risk at P < 0.01 were evaluated in GWAS conducted in European women including 122,977 cases and 105,974 controls. In the combined analysis of data from both Asian and European women, the lead variant in 28 loci not previously reported showed an association with breast cancer risk at P < 5 x10-8. In the meta-analysis of all GWAS data from Asian and European descendants, we identified SNPs in three additional loci in association with breast cancer risk at P < 5 x10-8. The associations for 10 of these loci were replicated in an independent sample of 16,787 cases and 16,680 controls of Asian women (P < 0.05). Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) and gene-based analyses provided evidence for the possible involvement of the YBEY, MAN2C1, SNUPN, TBX1, SEMA4A, STC1, MUTYH, LOXL2, and LINC00886 genes underlying the associations observed in eight of these 28 newly identified risk loci. In addition, we replicated the association for 78 of the 166 previously reported risk variants at P < 0.05 in women of Asian descent using GWAS data. These findings improve our understanding of breast cancer genetics and etiology and extend to Asian populations previous findings from studies of European women.","Shu, X.; Long, J.; Cai, Q.; Kweon, S.-S.; Choi, J.-Y.; Kubo, M.; Park, S.

334,"How do maternal HIV infection and the early nutritional environment influence the development of infants exposed to HIV in utero?","Malnutrition and infectious disease often coexist in socially inequitable contexts. Malnutrition in the perinatal period adversely affects offspring development and lifelong non-communicable disease risk. Less is known about the effects of infectious disease exposure during critical windows of development and health, and links between in utero HIV-exposure in the absence of neonatal infection, perinatal nutritional environments, and infant development are poorly defined. In a pilot study at Kalafong Hospital, Pretoria, South Africa, we aimed to understand how early nutritional environments and in utero HIV-exposure, without infection (HIV exposed uninfected [HEU] infants) may influence infant development. Mother-infant dyads were recruited after delivery and followed until 12 weeks postpartum. Maternal reports of food insecurity were associated with lower maternal nutrient intakes 12 weeks postpartum, and in infants, with lower Apgar scores (five minutes), higher brain-to-body weight ratio at birth and 12 weeks of age, and attainment of fewer large movement and play activities milestones at 12 weeks of age, irrespective of maternal HIV status. Reports of worry about food runout were associated with increased risk of stunting for HEU, but not unexposed, uninfected infants. Our findings suggest that food insecurity, in a vulnerable population, adversely affects maternal nutritional status and infant development. In utero exposure to HIV may further perpetuate these effects, which has implications for early child development and lifelong human capital.","White, M.; Duffley, E.; Feucht, U.

372,"Does in utero HIV-exposure influence infant development and immune outcomes? Findings from a pilot study in Pretoria, South Africa.","HIV-infected infants show altered growth, brain development, and immune function. Yet, it remains unclear how detrimental fetal exposure to maternal HIV infection is to the development of the uninfected infant. A pilot study was conducted at Kalafong Hospital in Pretoria, South Africa, to better understand how maternal HIV infection influences infant outcomes. We hypothesised that in utero HIV-exposed, uninfected (HEU) infants would have poorer postnatal development and altered innate immune composition compared to HIV-unexposed, uninfected infants (HUU). Infant growth, neurodevelopment (Guide for Monitoring Child Development [GMCD]) and levels of monocyte subsets (CD14, CD16, and CCR2 expression [flow cytometry]) were measured in infants at birth and 12-weeks. HEU infants had lower head circumference and elevated CCR2+ (% and median fluorescence intensity) on monocytes at birth compared to HUU. Most infants met GMCD milestones at 1-3 and 3-5 months. Our findings that HEU infants had reduced head circumference and increased levels of migratory monocytes at birth, which has been associated with poor motor and cognitive outcomes, is consistent with our motor results within 5 months of age. Elevated levels of migratory monocytes may initiate pro-inflammatory pathways that target the brain, impacting neurodevelopment and lifelong health.","White, M.; Feucht, U.

597,"PathFlowAI: A High-Throughput Workflow for Preprocessing, Deep Learning and Interpretation in Digital Pathology","The diagnosis of disease often requires analysis of a biopsy. Many diagnoses depend not only on the presence of certain features but on their location within the tissue. Recently, a number of deep learning diagnostic aids have been developed to classify digitized biopsy slides. Clinical workflows often involve processing of more than 500 slides per day. But, clinical use of deep learning diagnostic aids would require a preprocessing workflow that is cost-effective, flexible, scalable, rapid, interpretable, and transparent. Here, we present such a workflow, optimized using Dask and mixed precision training via APEX, capable of handling any patch-level or slide level classification and prediction problem. The workflow uses a flexible and fast preprocessing and deep learning analytics pipeline, incorporates model interpretation and has a highly storage-efficient audit trail. We demonstrate the utility of this package on the analysis of a prototypical anatomic pathology specimen, liver biopsies for evaluation of hepatitis from a prospective cohort. The preliminary data indicate that PathFlowAI may become a cost-effective and time-efficient tool for clinical use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms.","Levy, J.; Salas, L.

Methods: We performed a scoping review, searching 11 published and grey literature databases with subject headings and key words pertaining to the concepts of 1) AI and 2) primary care: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cinahl, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, MathSciNet, AAAI, arXiv. Screening included title and abstract and then full text stages. Final inclusion criteria: 1) research study of any design, 2) developed or used AI, 3) used primary care data and/or study conducted in a primary care setting and/or explicit mention of study applicability to primary care; exclusion criteria: 1) narrative, editorial, or textbook chapter, 2) not applicable to primary care population or settings, 3) full text inaccessible in the English Language. We extracted and summarized seven key characteristics of included studies: overall study purpose(s), author appointments, primary care functions, author intended target end user(s), target health condition(s), location of data source(s) (if any), subfield(s) of AI. Results: Of 5,515 non-duplicate documents, 405 met our eligibility criteria. The body of literature is primarily focused on creating novel AI methods or modifying existing AI methods to support physician diagnostic or treatment recommendations, for chronic conditions, using data from higher income countries. Meaningfully more studies had at least one author with a technology, engineering, or math appointment than with a primary care appointment (57 (14%) compared to 217 (54%)). Predominant AI subfields were supervised machine learning and expert systems.

244,"Harmonizing Palliative Care: National Survey to Evaluate the Knowledge and Attitude of Emergency Physicians towards Palliative Care","Background and Aim: Although the challenges of integrating palliative care practices across care settings are real and well recognised until now little is known about palliative care practice of emergency physicians (EPs) and their accessibility to palliative care services in Kuwait. So the aim of this study was to explore the attitude, and knowledge encountered by EPs in providing palliative care in all general hospitals in Kuwait. Method: A cross-sectional survey was performed in the emergency rooms of all general hospitals in Kuwait using Palliative Care Attitude and Knowledge (PCAK) questionnaire. Results: Of the total number of physicians working in emergency rooms (n=156), 104 (66.67%) had completed the survey. 76.9% (n=80) of the EPs had either uncertain attitude toward palliative care. Most of the EPs (n=73, 70.28%) did not discuss the need of the patients to palliative care either with the patients or their families. Only 16 (15.4%) of the EPs responded correctly to the most of the questions while nearly half of the EPs (n=51, 49%) had poor knowledge especially in the most effective management of refractory dysnea (n=18, 17.3%). Experience more than 11yrs and better knowledge scores were independent predictors of positive attitude after adjustment of age, sex, qualifications, speciality, position, and nationality [OR: 5.747 (CI: 1.031-25.00), 1.458(CI: 1.148-1.851); p-value: 0.021, 0.002 respectively]. Conclusions: Despite recognising palliative care as an important competence, the majority of the emergency physicians in Kuwait had uncertain attitude and poor knowledge towards palliative care. Lack of knowledge, direct accessibility to palliative care services and lack of support from palliative medicine specialists were the main reasons for uncertain and negative attitude. Efforts should be done to enhance physician training and provide palliative care resources in order to improve the quality of care given to patients visiting emergency departments.","Alansari, A.

We compared effectiveness of oral terbinafine daily (Terb) (active control) versus itraconazole daily (Itra) versus terbinafine plus itraconazole daily (TI) versus terbinafine daily plus itraconazole pulse (TIp) in tinea corporis, tinea cruris and tinea faciei in a pragmatic randomized open trial. Methods: Ninety-two microscopically confirmed patients were allocated to Terb (6 mg/kg/day), Itra (5 mg/kg/day), TI (terbinafine 6 mg/kg/day, itraconazole 5 mg/kg/day), or TIp (terbinafine 6 mg/kg/day, itraconazole 10 mg/kg/day for 1 week in 4 weeks) group by concealed block randomization and treated for 8 weeks or cure. Results: Cure rates were similar at 4 weeks (P=0.768). At 8 weeks, 5 (21.7%), 18 (78.3%), 16 (69.6%), and 16 (69.6%) patients were cured in Terb, Itra, TI, and TIp groups, respectively. All experimental regimens (Itra, TI, TIp) were more effective than Terb (P[&le;]0.0027). All experimental regimens had similar effectiveness (P[&ge;]0.738). Relapse rates 4 and 8 weeks after cure were similar (P=0.869 and 0.314, respectively). Number-needed-to-treat (NNT) was 2 for Itra, 3 for TI, and 3 for TIp. Conclusions: Oral itraconazole given daily (NNT=2) is the most effective treatment and combining it with terbinafine does not increase effectiveness.","Singh, S.; Anchan, V.

As part of quality control, another reviewer will independently assess 10-20% of the articles extracted. In Phase 1, the profiles of the published research will be reported descriptively. In Phase 2, a research quality screening tool will be validated to assess research quality based on three major domains of relevance, credibility of the methods and usefulness of the results. Associations between the research characteristics and quality will be analysed. The independent effect of each of the determinant will be quantified in multivariable regression analysis. Longitudinal trends of the research profiles, health conditions in different settings will be explored. Depending on the availability of resources, this review project may proceed according to the different clinical and biomedical disciplines in sequence. Discussion: Results of this study will serve as the 'baseline' data for future evaluation and within country and between countries comparison. This review may also provide informative results to stakeholders of the evolution of research conduct and performance from the past till now. The longitudinal and prospective trends of the research profiles and quality could provide suggestions on improvement initiatives. Additionally, health conditions or areas in different settings, and whether they are over- or under-studied may help future prioritization of research initiatives and resources.","Chew, B.

285,"A systematic review and meta-analysis on the effectiveness of an early invasive strategy compared to a conservative approach in elderly patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome","Background: Elderly patients, 65 years old and older, largely represent (>50 %) of hospital-admitted patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Data are conflicting comparing efficacy of early routine invasive (within 48-72 hours of initial evaluation) versus conservative management of ACS in this population. Objective: We aimed to determine the effectiveness of routine early invasive strategy compared to conservative treatment in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events in elderly patients with non-ST elevation (NSTE) ACS. Data Sources: We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials through PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar database. Study Selection: The studies included were randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of invasive strategy compared to conservative treatment among elderly patients > 65 years old diagnosed with NSTEACS. Studies were included if they assessed any of the following outcomes of death, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, recurrent angina, and need for revascularization. Five articles were subsequently included in the meta-analysis. Data Extraction: Three independent reviewers extracted the data of interest from the articles using a standardized data collection form that included study quality indicators. Disparity in assessment was settled by an independent adjudicator. Data Synthesis: All pooled analyses were based on fixed effects model. A total of 2,495 patients were included, 1337 in the invasive strategy group, and 1158 in the conservative treatment group. Results: Meta-analysis showed less incidence of revascularization in the invasive (2%) over conservative treatment groups (8%), with overall risk ratio of 0.31 (95% CI 0.16-0.61, I2 =0%). There was also less incidence of stroke in the invasive (2%) versus conservative group (3%) but this was not statistically significant. A significant benefit was noted in the reduction of all-cause mortality (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.55-0.72, I2=84%) and myocardial infarction (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.49-0.79, I2=63%) but with significant heterogeneity. Conclusion: There was a significantly lower rate of revascularization in the invasive strategy group compared to the conservative treatment group. In the reduction of all-cause mortality and MI, there was benefit favoring invasive strategy but with significant heterogeneity. These findings do not support the bias against early routine invasive intervention in the elderly group with NSTEACS. However, further studies focusing on the elderly with larger population sizes are still needed.","Reano, J. D. P.; Shiu, L. A.; Miralles, K.; Dimalala, M. G.; Reyes, M.

263,"Enhancing multi-center generalization of machine learning-based depression diagnosis from resting-state fMRI","Resting-state fMRI has the potential to find abnormal behavior in brain activity and to diagnose patients with depression. However, resting-state fMRI has a bias depending on the scanner site, which makes it difficult to diagnose depression at a new site. In this paper, we propose methods to improve the performance of the diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) at an independent site by reducing the site bias effects using regression. For this, we used a subgroup of healthy subjects of the independent site to regress out site bias. We further improved the classification performance of patients with depression by focusing on melancholic depressive disorder. Our proposed methods would be useful to apply depression classifiers to subjects at completely new sites.","Nakano, T.; Takamura, M.; Ichikawa, N.; Okada, G.; Okamoto, Y.; Yamada, M.; Suhara, T.; Yamawaki, S.; Yoshimoto, J.",20190825,"Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology","10.1101/19004051",1,"Junichiro Yoshimoto","Nara Institute of Science and Technology","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19004051v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19004051v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"The original data for this study is confidential due to the involvement of patient data.

184,"Enhanced mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR+) in episodic migraine: a randomized clinical trial with MRI outcomes","Background: Mindfulness interventions have not been rigorously evaluated in episodic migraine. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of an enhanced mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR+) versus stress management for headache (SMH). Design, Setting, Participants: Randomized, assessor-blind, clinical trial of 98 adults with episodic migraine recruited at a single academic center comparing MBSR+ (n=50) to SMH (n=48). (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02133209) Intervention: MBSR+ and SMH were delivered weekly by group for 8 weeks, then bi-weekly for another 8 weeks. Measurements: The primary outcome was reduction in headache days from baseline to 20 weeks. MRI outcomes included activity of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and cognitive task network during cognitive challenge, resting state connectivity of right dorsal anterior insula (daINS) to DLPFC and cognitive task network, and gray matter volume of DLPFC, daINS, and anterior midcingulate. Secondary outcomes were headache-related disability, pain severity, response to treatment, migraine days, and MRI whole-brain analyses. Results: Reduction in headache days from baseline to 20 weeks was greater for MBSR+ (7.8 [95%CI, 6.9-8.8] to 4.6 [95%CI, 3.7-5.6]) than for SMH (7.7 [95%CI 6.7-8.7] to 6.0 [95%CI, 4.9-7.0]) (P=0.04). 52% of the MBSR+ group showed a response to treatment (50% reduction in headache days) compared with 23% in the SMH group (P=0.004). Reduction in headache-related disability was greater for MBSR+ (59.6 [95%CI, 57.9-61.3] to 54.6 [95%CI, 52.9-56.4]) than SMH (59.6 [95%CI, 57.7-61.5] to 57.5 [95%CI, 55.5-59.4]) (P=0.02). There were no differences in clinical outcomes at 52 weeks or MRI outcomes at 20 weeks, although changes related to cognitive networks with MBSR+ were observed. Limitations: A single site and likely self-selection bias. Conclusions: MBSR+ is an effective treatment option for episodic migraine.","Seminowicz, D.

286,"Where should new parkrun events be located? Modelling the potential impact of 200 new events on socio-economic inequalities in access and participation.","Background parkrun, an international movement which organises free weekly 5km running events, has been widely praised for encouraging inactive individuals to participate in physical activity. Recently, parkrun received funding to establish 200 new events across England, specifically targeted at deprived communities. This study aims to investigate the relationships between geographic access, deprivation, and participation in parkrun, and to inform the planned expansion by proposing future event locations. Methods We conducted an ecological spatial analysis, using data on 455 parkrun events, 2,842 public green spaces, and 32,844 English census areas. Poisson regression was applied to investigate the relationships between the distances to events, deprivation, and parkrun participation rates. Model estimates were incorporated into a location-allocation analysis, to identify locations for future events that maximise deprivation-weighted parkrun participation. Results The distance to the nearest event (in km) and the Index of Multiple Deprivation (score) were both independently negatively associated with local parkrun participation rates. Rate ratios were 0.921 (95%CI = 0.921-0.922) and 0.959 (0.959-0.959), respectively. The recommended 200 new event locations were estimated to increase weekly runs by 6.9% (from 82,824 to 88,506). Of the additional runs, 4.1% (n=231) were expected to come from the 10% most deprived communities. Conclusion Participation in parkrun is wide spread across England. We provide recommendations for new parkrun event location, in order to increase participation from deprived communities. However, the creation of new events alone is unlikely to be an effective strategy. Further research is needed to study how barriers to participation can be reduced.","Schneider, P. P.; Smith, R.

218,"Peripheral Biomarkers of Tobacco-Use Disorder: A Systematic Review","Introduction: Tobacco use disorder (TUD) is a major worldwide healthcare burden resulting in 7 million deaths annually. TUD has few approved cessation aids, all of which are associated a high rate of relapse within one year. Biomarkers of TUD severity, treatment response, and risk of relapse have high potential clinical utility to identify ideal responders and guide additional treatment resources. Methods: A MEDLINE search was performed using the terms biomarkers, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, bilirubin, inositol, cotinine, adrenocorticotropic hormone, cortisol, pituitary-adrenal system, homovanillic acid, dopamine, pro-opiomelanocortin, lipids, lipid metabolism all cross-referenced with tobacco-use disorder. Results: The search yielded 424 results, of which 57 met inclusion criteria. The most commonly studied biomarkers were those related to nicotine metabolism, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and cardiovascular (CVD) risk. Nicotine metabolism was most associated with severity of dependence and treatment response, where as HPA axis and CVD markers showed less robust associations with dependence and relapse risk. Conclusions: Nicotine-metabolite ratio, cortisol, and atherogenicity markers appear to be the most promising lead biomarkers for further investigation, though the body of literature is still preliminary. Longitudinal, repeated-measures studies are required to determine the directionality of the observed associations and determine true predictive power of these biomarkers. Future studies should also endeavour to study populations with comorbid psychiatric disorders to determine differences in utility of certain biomarkers.","Newton, D.

676,"Lower germline mutation rates in young adults predictlonger lives and longer reproductive lifespans","BACKGROUND: Analysis of sequenced genomes from large three-generation families allows de novo mutations identified in Generation II individuals to be attributed to each of their parents' germlines in Generation I. Because germline mutations increase with age, we hypothesized that they directly limit the duration of childbearing in women, and if correlated with mutation accumulation in somatic tissues, also reflect systemic aging in both sexes. Here we test whether the germline mutation rates of Generation I individuals when they were young adults predict their remaining survival, as well as the women's reproductive lifespans. METHODS: Germline autosomal mutation counts in 122 Generation I individuals (61 women, 61 men) from 41 three-generation Utah CEPH families were converted to germline mutation rates by normalizing each subject's number of mutations to the callable portion of their genome. Age at death, cause of death, all-site cancer incidence, and reproductive histories were provided by the Utah Population Database, Cancer Registry, and Utah Genetic Reference Project. Fertility analyses were restricted to the 53 women whose age at last birth (ALB) was at least 30 years, the approximate age when the decline in female fertility begins. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to test the association of age-adjusted mutation rates (AAMRs) with aging-related outcomes. Linear regression analysis was used to estimate the age when adult germline mutation accumulation rates are established. FINDINGS: Quartiles of increasing AAMRs were associated with increasing all-cause mortality rates in both sexes combined (test for trend, p=0.009); subjects in the top quartile of AAMRs experienced more than twice the mortality of bottom quartile subjects (hazard ratio [HR], 2.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-3.56; p=0.008; median survival difference = 4.7 years). Women with higher AAMRs had significantly fewer live births and a younger ALB. The analyses also indicate that adult germline mutation accumulation rates are established in adolescence, and that later menarche in women may delay mutation accumulation. INTERPRETATION: Parental-age-adjusted germline mutation rates in healthy young adults may provide a measure of both reproductive and systemic aging. Puberty may induce the establishment of adult mutation accumulation rates, just when DNA repair genes' expression levels are known to begin their lifelong decline.","Cawthon, R. M.; Meeks, H.

715,"Transcranial random noise stimulation for the acute treatment of depression: a randomized-controlled trial","Background Transcranial electrical stimulation has broad potential as a treatment for depression. Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS), which delivers randomly fluctuating current intensities, may have greater cortical excitatory effects compared to other forms of transcranial electrical stimulation. We therefore aimed to investigate the antidepressant efficacy of tRNS. Methods Depressed participants were randomly assigned by computer number generator to receive 20 sessions of either active or sham tRNS over four weeks in a double-blinded, parallel group randomized-controlled trial. tRNS was delivered for 30mins with a direct current offset of 2mA and a random noise range of 2mA. Primary analyses assessed changes in depression severity using the Montgomery-Asperg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Neuroplasticity, neuropsychological, and safety outcomes were analysed as secondary measures. Results 69 participants were randomised, of which three discontinued treatment early leaving 66 (sham n = 34, active n = 32) for per-protocol analysis. Depression severity scores reduced in both groups (MADRS reduction in sham = 7.0 [95%CI 5.0-8.9]; and active = 5.2 [95%CI 3.2-7.3]). However, there were no differences between active and sham groups in the reduction of depressive symptoms, or the number of participants meeting response (sham = 14.7%; active = 3.1%) and remission criteria (sham = 5.9%; active = 0%). Erythema, paraesthesia, fatigue, and dizziness/light-headedness occurred more frequently in the active tRNS group. Neuroplasticity, neuropsychological and acute cognitive effects were comparable between groups. Conclusion Our results do not support the use of tRNS with the current stimulation parameters as a therapeutic intervention for the treatment of depression.

185,"Time to death and its Predictors among Adult TB/HIV Co-Infected Patients in Mizan Tepi University Teaching Hospital, South West Ethiopia","Abstract Background: Tuberculosis (TB) and Human Immuno Deficiency Virus (HIV) co-infection represents a complex pathogenic scenario with synergistic effect and leads to about 300,000 HIV-associated TB deaths in the world in 2017. Despite this burden of death, time to death and its predictors among TB-HIV co-infected patient was not adequately studied; and the existing evidences are inconsistent. Therefore, this study was aimed to determine time to death and identify its predictors among adult TB/HIV co-infected patients. Method: Retrospective cohort study was conducted by reviewing registers of randomly selected 364 TB/HIV co-infected patients enrolled in health care from July 2, 2007 up to July 1, 2017 at Mizan Tepi University Teaching Hospital. The hospital was located in Bench Maji Zone, South West Ethiopia. Data were collected from March 1 through 31, 2018, entered to Epi data 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 21. Each patient was followed from date of TB treatment initiation till death, loss to follow up and treatment completed. On the other hand, events other than death were considered as censored. After checking the proportional hazard model assumption, Cox-regression was used to identify the predictors. In bivariable analyses, P-value[&le;]0.25 was used to identify candidate variables for multivariable analysis. The 95% CI of hazard ratio (HR) with respective P-value <0.05 was used to declare significance in the final model. Result: All the 364 patients were followed for 1,654 person months. There were 83 (22.8%) deaths and most 38 (45.8%) were occurring within the first two months of anti-TB treatment initiation. The overall incidence rate and median survival time were 5.02 per 100 person months (95% CI: 4.05, 6.22) and 10 months respectively. Statistically significant better survival was observed among patients: with CD4 [&ge;] 200 cells/mm3 (P<0.001), who had a history of cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) use (P<0.001), who disclose their HIV status (P<0.001) and with working functional status (P<0.001). Not using CPT (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] =1.72; P=0.023), bedridden functional status (AHR=2.55; P=0.007), not disclosing HIV status (AHR=4.03; P<0.001) and CD4 < 200 cells/mm3 (AHR=6.05; P<0.001) were predictors of time to death among TB/HIV co-infected patients. Conclusion: The median survival time was 10 months and poor survival was associated with low CD4 count, not using CPT, not disclosing HIV status and having bedridden functional status. Close monitoring of bedridden and low CD4 count patients, prompt CPT initiation and encouraging HIV status disclosure are recommended.

818,"Causal mediation analysis of Subclinical Hypothyroidism in children with obesity and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease","Context: Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is a common co-morbidity of obesity and a leading cause of liver disease in children. Subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) occurs with obesity and may contribute to dysmetabolic state that predisposes to NAFLD. Objective: To assess the relationship between SH and NAFLD in children with biopsy-proven NAFLD compared to controls. Design and Methods: In this retrospective study of cases from a registry of children with biopsy-proven NAFLD and age-matched controls, the association of SH with NAFLD and other cardiometabolic parameters was assessed followed by causal mediation analyses under the counter-factual framework. Results: Sixty-six cases and 4067 age-matched controls were included in the study. Children with NAFLD were more likely to be male (74.6 vs 39.4%, p < 0.001), have higher modified BMI-z scores (2.3 {+/-}1.6 vs 1{+/-} 1.6, p < 0.001), and abnormal metabolic parameters (TSH, ALT, HDL-C, non-HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG). Multivariate analyses controlling for age, sex and severity of obesity showed significant association between the 4th quartile of TSH and NAFLD. Causal mediation analysis demonstrates that TSH mediates 44% of the effect of modified BMI-z score on NAFLD. This comprises of 16.2% (OR = 1.1, p < 0.001) caused by the indirect effect of TSH and its interaction with modified BMI-z, and 26.5% (OR = 1.1, p = 0.01) as an autonomous effect of TSH on NAFLD regardless of the obesity. Conclusions: The association of SH and biopsy-proven NAFLD is demonstrated in a predominately Latino population. Further, a causal mediation analysis implicates an effect of TSH on NAFLD, independent of obesity.","Nichols, P.; Pan, Y.; May, B.; Pavlicova, M.; Rausch, J.; Mencin, A.; Thaker, V.

209,"Applications of qualitative grounded theory methodology to investigate hearing loss: Protocol for a qualitative systematic review","ABTRACT Introduction: Hearing loss is a chronic condition affecting 11 million individuals in the UK. People with hearing loss regularly experience difficulties interacting in everyday conversations. These difficulties in communication can result in a person with hearing loss withdrawing from social situations and becoming isolated. While hearing health loss research has largely deployed quantitative methods to investigate various aspects of the condition, qualitative research is becoming more widespread. Grounded theory is a specific qualitative methodology that has been used to establish novel theories on the experiences of living with hearing loss. Method and analysis: The aim of this systematic review is to establish how grounded theory has been applied to investigate the psychosocial aspects of hearing loss. Methods are reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 checklist. Studies included in this review will have applied grounded theory methodology. For a study to be included, it can apply grounded theory as an overarching methodology, or have grounded theory methodology embedded amongst other methodologies. These studies can be in the form of retrospective or prospective studies, before and after comparison studies, RCTs, non-RCTs, cohort studies, prospective observational studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, longitudinal studies, and mixed method studies. Purely quantitative studies, studies that have not applied grounded theory methodology, articles reporting expert opinions, case reports, practice guidelines, case series, conference abstracts, and book chapters will be excluded. Studies included will have adult participants ([&ge;]18 years) who are either people with an acquired hearing loss, their family and friends (communication partners), or audiologists. The quality of application of grounded theory in each study will be assessed using the Guideline for Reporting and Evaluating Grounded Theory Research Studies (GUREGT). Ethics and dissemination: As only secondary data will be used in this systematic review, ethical approval is not required. No other ethical issues are foreseen. The International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (http://www crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO) holds the registration record of this systematic review. Findings will be disseminated via peer reviewed publications and at relevant academic conferences. Findings may also be published in relevant professional and third sector newsletters and magazines as appropriate. Data will inform future research and guideline development. Prospero registration number: PROSPERO CRD42019134197 Strengths and limitations of this study: This systematic review is the first to provide a comprehensive critique of the use of grounded theory to investigate hearing loss. The search strategy was formed in collaboration with an information specialist at the University of Nottingham. The PRISMA-P guidelines have directed the considerations and layout of this protocol. Because experiences and articulations of hearing loss are influenced by age, only adult ([&ge;]18 years) participants (people with hearing loss, communication partners, audiologists) will be considered. The search will not include grey literature. The studies included will only have samples of individuals with hearing loss, rather than full deafness.","Ali, Y. H.

220,"A comparison of contemporary versus older studies of aspirin for primary prevention","Objective: This study compares the benefits and harms of aspirin for primary prevention before and after widespread use of statins and colorectal cancer screening. Methods: We compared studies of aspirin for primary prevention that recruited patients from 2005 onward with previous individual patient meta-analyses that recruited patients from 1978 to 2002. Data for contemporary studies were synthesized using random-effects models. We report vascular (major adverse cardiovascular events [MACE], myocardial infarction [MI], stroke), bleeding, cancer, and mortality outcomes. Results: The IPD analyses of older studies included 95,456 patients for CV prevention and 25,270 for cancer mortality, while the four newer studies had 61,604 patients. Relative risks for vascular outcomes for older vs newer studies follow: MACE: 0.89 (95% CI 0.83-0.95) vs 0.93 (0.86-0.99); fatal hemorrhagic stroke: 1.73 (1.11-2.72) vs 1.06 (0.66-1.70); any ischemic stroke: 0.86 (0.74-1.00) vs 0.86 (0.75-0.98); any MI: 0.84 (0.77-0.92) vs 0.88 (0.77-1.00); and non-fatal MI: 0.79 (0.71-0.88) vs 0.94 (0.83-1.08). Cancer death was not significantly decreased in newer studies (RR 1.11, 0.92-1.34). Major hemorrhage was significantly increased for both older and newer studies (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.25-1.76 vs 1.37, 95% CI 1.24-1.53). There was no effect in either group on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, fatal stroke, or fatal MI. Conclusions: In the modern era characterized by widespread statin use and cancer screening, aspirin does not reduce the risk of non-fatal MI or cancer death. There are no mortality benefits and a significant risk of major hemorrhage. Aspirin should no longer be recommended for primary prevention.","Moriarty, F.; Ebell, M.

369,"Zika Virus Infection: Review Of Neuroimage Studies And The Relationship Between Findings And Time Of Infection","AIM: To conduct a systematic literature review on neuroimage findings in children with microcephaly by Zika virus (ZIKV). METHOD: We performed a literature search in PubMed, Cochrane Library and Web of Science for full-text articles reporting neuroimage exam of computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Were identified 2,214 publications. Of these 2,170 were excluded by the analysis of titles and abstracts, resulting in 7 articles included. The abnormalities presented in neuroimage showed the highest occurrence in the first trimester: decreased brain volume + increased extra-axial CSF space (100%), subcortical calcifications (89.1%), microcephaly (89.1%), ventriculomegaly (72.9%), malformation of cortical development (40.5%), basal ganglia calcifications (40.5%), megacisterna magna (39.1%). In relation to the second trimester of ZIKV infection, the most common were as follows: decreased brain volume + increased extra-axial CSF space (100%), subcortical calcifications (100%), microcephaly (85.7%), ventriculomegaly (71.4%), malformation of cortical development (71.4%), basal ganglia calcifications (19%), megacisterna magna (4.7%). In relation to the neuroimage abnormalities detected in the 3rd trimester 2 cases were found. INTERPRETATION: This systematic review is the first that evaluates brain changes in newborns with different neuroimage techniques (CT and MRI exams) and related findings with the gestational period of ZIKV infection.","Radaelli, G.; Lahorgue, M.; Bernardi, R.; Monteiro, J.; Bruzzo, F.; Neto, F.; Leal-Conceicao, E.; Portuguez, M.; Da Costa, J.",20190920,"Neurology","10.1101/19004283",1,"Jaderson Da Costa","PUCRS","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19004283v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19004283v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"Not Applicable."
709,"Health Care Provider Compliance with the HIPAA Right of Individual Access: A Scorecard and Survey","Background: Historically, patients have had difficulty obtaining copies of their medical records, notwithstanding the legal right to do so. In 2018, a study of 83 top hospitals found discrepancies between those hospitals published information and telephone survey responses regarding their processes for release of records to patients, indicating noncompliance with the HIPAA right of individual access. Objective: Assess state of compliance with the HIPAA right of access across a broader range of health care providers and in the context of real records requests from patients. Methods: Evaluate the degree of compliance with the HIPAA right of access 1) through telephone surveys of health care institutions regarding release of records to patients and 2) by scoring the responses of a total of 210 health care providers to actual patient record requests against the HIPAA right of access requirements. (51 of those providers were part of an initial cohort of 51 scored for an earlier version of this paper.) Results: Based on the scores of responses of 210 health care providers to record requests and the responses of nearly 3000 healthcare institutions to telephone surveys, more than 50% of health care providers are out of compliance with the HIPAA right of access. The most common failure was refusal to send records to patient or patients designee in the form and format requested by the patient, with 86% of noncompliance due to this factor. The number of phone calls required to obtain records in compliance with HIPAA, and the lack of consistency in provider responses to actual requests, makes the records retrieval process a challenging one for patients. Conclusions: Recent federal proposals prioritize patient access to medical records through certified electronic health record (EHR) technology, but access by patients to their complete clinical records via EHRs is years away. In the meantime, health care providers need to focus more attention on compliance with the HIPAA right of access, including better training of staff on HIPAA requirements. Greater enforcement of the law will help motivate providers to prioritize this issue.","Mcgraw, D. C.; Fitter, N.; Taylor, L.

186,"Self-blaming emotions in major depression: a randomised pilot trial comparing fMRI neurofeedback training with self-guided psychological strategies (NeuroMooD)","Background: Overgeneralised self-blame and worthlessness are key symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) and were previously associated with self-blame-selective changes in connectivity between right superior anterior temporal lobe (rSATL) and subgenual frontal areas. In a previous study, remitted MDD patients successfully modulated guilt-selective rSATL-subgenual cingulate connectivity using real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rtfMRI) neurofeedback training, thereby increasing their self-esteem. The feasibility and potential of using this approach in symptomatic MDD were unknown. Methods: This single-blind pre-registered randomised controlled pilot trial tested the clinical potential of a novel self-guided psychological intervention with and without additional rSATL-posterior subgenual cortex (SC) rtfMRI neurofeedback, targeting self-blaming emotions in insufficiently recovered people with MDD and early treatment-resistance (n=43, n=35 completers). Following a diagnostic baseline assessment, patients completed three self-guided sessions to rebalance self-blaming biases and a post-treatment assessment. The fMRI neurofeedback software FRIEND was used to measure rSATL-posterior SC connectivity, while the BDI-II was administered to assess depressive symptom severity as a primary outcome measure. Results: Both interventions were demonstrated to be safe and beneficial, resulting in a mean reduction of MDD symptom severity by 46% and response rates of more than 55%, with no group difference. Secondary analyses, however, revealed a differential response on our primary outcome measure between MDD patients with and without DSM-5 defined anxious distress. Stratifying by anxious distress features was investigated, because this was found to be the most common subtype in our sample. MDD patients without anxious distress showed a higher response to rtfMRI neurofeedback training compared to the psychological intervention, with the opposite pattern found in anxious MDD. We explored potentially confounding clinical differences between subgroups and found that anxious MDD patients were much more likely to experience anger towards others as measured on our psychopathological interview which might play a role in their poorer response to neurofeedback. In keeping with the hypothesis that self-worth plays a key role in MDD, improvement on our primary outcome measure was correlated with increases in self-esteem after the intervention and this correlated with the frequency with which participants employed the strategies to tackle self-blame outside of the treatment sessions. Conclusions: These findings suggest that self-blame-selective rtfMRI neurofeedback training may be superior over a solely psychological intervention in non-anxious MDD, although further confirmatory studies are needed. The self-guided psychological intervention showed a surprisingly high clinical potential in the anxious MDD group which needs further confirmation compared vs treatment-as-usual. Future studies need to investigate whether self-blame-selective rSATL-SC connectivity changes are irrelevant in anxious MDD, which could explain their response being better to the psychological intervention without interfering neurofeedback.","Jaeckle, T.; Williams, S.

735,"Efficient prediction of vitamin B deficiencies via machine-learning using routine blood test results in patients with intense psychiatric episode","Background: Vitamin B deficiency is common worldwide and may lead to psychiatric symptoms; however, vitamin B deficiency epidemiology in patients with intense psychiatric episode has rarely been examined. Moreover, vitamin deficiency testing is costly and time-consuming, which has hampered effectively ruling out vitamin deficiency-induced intense psychiatric symptoms. In this study, we aimed to clarify the epidemiology of these deficiencies and efficiently predict them using machine-learning models from patient characteristics and routine blood test results that can be obtained within one hour. Methods: We reviewed 497 consecutive patients deemed to be at imminent risk of seriously harming themselves or others over 2 years in a single psychiatric tertiary-care center. Machine-learning models (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest) were trained to predict each deficiency from age, sex, and 29 routine blood test results gathered in the period from September 2015 to December 2016. The models were validated using a dataset collected from January 2017 through August 2017. Results: We found that 112 (22.5%), 80 (16.1%), and 72 (14.5%) patients had vitamin B1, vitamin B12, and folate (vitamin B9) deficiency, respectively. Further, the machine-learning models were well generalized to predict deficiency in the future unseen data, especially using random forest; areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for the validation dataset (i.e. the dataset not used for training the models) were 0.716, 0.599, and 0.796, respectively. The Gini importance of these vitamins provided further evidence of a relationship between these vitamins and the complete blood count, while also indicating a hitherto rarely considered, potential association between these vitamins and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) or thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Discussion: This study demonstrates that machine-learning can efficiently predict some vitamin deficiencies in patients with active psychiatric symptoms, based on the largest cohort to date with intense psychiatric episode. The prediction method may expedite risk stratification and clinical decision-making regarding whether replacement therapy should be prescribed. Further research includes validating its external generalizability in other clinical situations and clarify whether interventions based on this method could improve patient care and cost-effectiveness.","Tamune, H.; Ukita, J.; Hamamoto, Y.; Tanaka, H.; Narushima, K.; Yamamoto, N.",20191113,"Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology","10.1101/19004317",2,"Hidetaka Tamune","Department of Neuropsychiatry, Tokyo Metropolitan Tama Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19004317v2?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19004317v2.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd","10.3389/fpsyt.2019.01029","The source code will be available on https://github.com/ukky17/vitaminPrediction after acceptance.

197,"Immunoglobulin E as a biomarker for the overlap of atopic asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease","Asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) is a common clinical syndrome, yet there is no single objective definition. We hypothesized that Immunoglobulin E measurements could be used to refine the definition of ACO. In baseline plasma samples from 2870 subjects in the COPDGene Study, we measured total IgE levels and specific IgE levels to six common allergens. Compared to usual COPD, subjects with ACO had higher total IgE levels (median 67.0 vs 42.2 IU/ml) and more frequently had at least one positive specific IgE (43.5 vs 24.5%). We previously used a strict definition of ACO in subjects with COPD, based on self-report of a doctor's diagnosis of asthma before the age of 40. This strict ACO definition was refined by the presence of atopy, determined by total IgE gt;100 IU/ml or at least one positive specific IgE, as was a broader definition of ACO based on any asthma history. Subjects will all three ACO definitions were younger (mean age 60.0-61.3), were more commonly African American (36.8-44.2%), had a higher exacerbation frequency (1.0-1.2 in the past year), and had more airway wall thickening on quantitative analysis of chest CT scans. Among subjects with clinical ACO, 37-46% did not have atopy; these subjects had more emphysema on chest CT scan. Based on associations with exacerbations and CT airway disease, IgE did not clearly improve the clinical definition of ACO. However, IgE measurements could be used to subdivide subjects with atopic and non-atopic ACO, who might have different biologic mechanisms and potential treatments.","Hersh, C.

273,"Estimating the health impact of vaccination against 10 pathogens in 98 low and middle income countries from 2000 to 2030","Background The last two decades have seen substantial expansion of childhood vaccination programmes in low and middle income countries (LMICs). Here we quantify the health impact of these programmes by estimating the deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted by vaccination with ten antigens in 98 LMICs between 2000 and 2030. Methods Independent research groups provided model-based disease burden estimates under a range of vaccination coverage scenarios for ten pathogens: hepatitis B (HepB), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), human papillomavirus (HPV), Japanese encephalitis (JE), measles, Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A (MenA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, rotavirus, rubella, yellow fever. Using standardized demographic data and vaccine coverage estimates for routine and supplementary immunization activities, the impact of vaccination programmes on deaths and DALYs was determined by comparing model estimates from the no vaccination counterfactual scenario with those from a default coverage scenario. We present results in two forms: deaths/DALYs averted in a particular calendar year, and in a particular annual birth cohort. Findings We estimate that vaccination will have averted 70 (2.5-97.5% quantile range 54-80) million deaths between 2000 and 2030 across the 98 countries and ten pathogens considered, 35 (30-40) million of these between 2000-2018. From 2000-2018, this represents a 41% (36-44%) reduction in deaths due to the ten pathogens relative to the no vaccination counterfactual. Most (95% (93-99%)) of this impact is in under-five age mortality, notably from measles. Over the lifetime of birth cohorts born between 2000 and 2030, we predict that 121 (102-136) million deaths will be averted by vaccination, of which 58 (31-82) and 38 (10-81) million are due to measles and Hepatitis B vaccination, respectively. We estimate that recent increases in vaccine coverage and introductions of additional vaccines will result in a 72% (64-75%) reduction in lifetime mortality caused by these 10 pathogens in the 2018 birth cohort. Interpretation Increases in vaccine coverage and the introduction of new vaccines into LMICs over the last two decades have had a major impact in reducing mortality. These public health gains are predicted to increase in coming decades if progress in increasing coverage is sustained.","Li, X.; Mukandavire, C.; Cucunuba, Z. M.; Abbas, K.; Clapham, H.

193,"Elevated blood pressure in the emergency department - a risk factor for incident cardiovascular disease: An EHR-based cohort study","Objectives: In the emergency department (ED), high blood pressure (BP) is commonly observed but mostly used to evaluate patients' health in the short-term. We aimed to study whether ED-measured BP is associated with incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke in long-term, and to estimate the number needed to screen (NNS) to prevent ASCVD. Design: Electronic Health Records (EHR) and national register-based cohort study. The association between BP and incident ASCVD was studied with Cox-regression. Setting: Two university hospital emergency departments in Sweden. Data sources: BP data were obtained from EDs EHR, and outcome information was acquired through the Swedish National Patient Register for all participants. Participants: All patients [&ge;]18 years old who visited the EDs between 2010 to 2016, with an obtained BP (n=300,193). Main outcome measures: Incident ASCVD, MI, and stroke during follow-up. Results: The subjects were followed for a median of 42 months. 8,999 incident ASCVD events occurred (MI: 4,847, stroke: 6,661). Both diastolic and systolic BP (SBP) was associated with incident ASCVD, MI, and stroke with a progressively increased risk for SBP within hypertension grade 1 (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.24), 2 (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.47), and 3 (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.49 to 1.77). The six-year cumulative incidence of ASCVD was 12% for patients with SBP [&ge;]180 mmHg compared to 2% for normal levels. To prevent one ASCVD event during the median follow-up, NNS was estimated to 151, whereas NNT to 71. Conclusions: BP in the ED is associated with incident ASCVD, MI, and stroke. High BP recordings in EDs should not be disregarded as isolated events, but an opportunity to detect and improve treatment of hypertension. ED-measured BP provides an important and under-used tool with great potential to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension.","Oras, P.; Habel, H.; Skoglund, P.; Svensson, P.",20190810,"Cardiovascular Medicine","10.1101/19004382",1,"Pontus Oras","Department of Clinical Science and Education, Sodersjukhuset, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19004382v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19004382v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"No additional data are available."
211,"Prospective Trial Registration and Publication Rates of Randomized Clinical Trials in Digital Health: A Cross Sectional Analysis of Global Trial Registries","Registration of clinical trials was introduced to mitigate the risk of publication and selective reporting bias in the realm of clinical research. The prevalence of publication and selective reporting bias in trial results has been evidenced through scientific research. This bias may compromise the ethical and methodological conduct in the design, implementation and dissemination of evidence-based healthcare interventions. Principal investigators of digital health trials may be overwhelmed with challenges that are unique to digital health research, such as the usability of the intervention under test, participant recruitment, and retention challenges that may contribute to non-publication rate and prospective trial registration. Our primary research objective was to examine the prevalence of prospective registration and publication rates in digital health trials. We included 417 trials that enrolled participants in 2012 and were registered in any of the seventeen WHO registries. The prospective registration and publication rates were at (38.4%) and (65.5%) respectively. We identified a statistically significant (P<.001) ""Selective Registration Bias"" with 95.7% of trials published within a year after registration, were registered retrospectively. We reported a statistically significant relationship (P=.003) between prospective registration and funding sources, with industry-funded trials having the lowest compliance with prospective registration at (14.3%). The lowest non-publication rates were in the Middle East (26.7%) and Europe (28%), and the highest were in Asia (56.5%) and the U.S. (42.5%).

The aim of this study was to investigate cervical cytological abnormalities and its relation with CD4 (T4 Lymphocyte) count among HIV seropositive women. Methods: We conducted a study on 58 HIV positive women referred to Ahvaz Counseling Center for Behavioral Disease, southwest of Iran between 2016 and 2017. Pap smear was performed for all participants from the cervix and endocervix. Patient's characteristics including age, duration of disease, treatment with anti-retroviral treatment (ART), marital status, number of children, and contraception method were also recorded. Cervical cytological abnormalities reported as Bethesda system (TBS). A regular blood sample was taken from all the patients to evaluate the CD4 cells counts. Logistic regression models were used to obtain OR of presences of cytological abnormalities related to CD4 counts, controlling for important factors. Results: Out of 58 patients only 5 were not under ART. We demonstrated that 29.3 % of patients had squamous cell abnormalities and these abnormalities, was more prevalent among 30-40 years old patients (70.6%). The prevalence of ASC-US (Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance), LSIL (Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions) and HSIL (High-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions) were 19.0%, 3.4%, and 6.9% respectively. Overall 9 patients need to repeat Pap smear test. Presence of cervical cytological abnormalities was not associated with the CD4 count, even after adjusting for the variable such age, duration of disease and ART. Conclusion: We found a high prevalence of ASC-US in HIV-infected women which was independent of age, duration of diseases and history of ART. Though cervical cancer screening in this population might have a substantial public health benefit.","Darvishi, A.; Alavi, S. M.; Khafaie, M.

Materials and Methods: We conducted nominal group technique sessions with SSc patients who shared barriers to physical activities, barrier-specific facilitators, and general facilitators. Participants rated importance of barriers and likelihood of using facilitators from 0-10, and indicated whether they had tried facilitators. Barriers and facilitators across sessions were subsequently merged to eliminate overlap; edited based on feedback from investigators, patient advisors, and clinicians; and categorized. Results: We conducted nine sessions (n=41 total participants) and initially generated 181 barriers, 457 barrier-specific facilitators, and 20 general facilitators. The number of consolidated barriers (barrier-specific facilitators in parentheses) for each category were: 14 (61) for health and medical; 4 (23) for social and personal; 1 (3) for time, work, and lifestyle; and 1 (4) for environmental.

270,"Medal: a patient similarity metric using medication prescribing patterns","Patient similarity offers an exciting potential to improve our understanding of treatment patterns. Medication history is a valuable source of information given the clinical considerations taken during the physician's prescription process. However, available similarity methods do not consider timeliness of event occurrence in the longitudinal care of patients. In this observational cohort study, we propose an event alignment algorithm, Medal, which uses a dynamic programming approach for pairwise alignment of medication histories. To test our algorithm, we obtained the medication usage from a cohort of patients with pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS). After calculating a distance metric with Medal, we compute a hierarchical clustering and explore the most appropriate number of clusters. We identified four clusters in PANS with distinct medication usage histories, driven primarily by penicillin.

276,"Physician Suicide: A Scoping Review to Highlight Opportunities for Prevention","Objective: The aim of this scoping review is to map the current landscape of published research and perspectives on physician suicide. Findings could serve as a roadmap for further investigations and potentially inform efforts to prevent physician suicide. Methods: Ovid MEDLINE, PsycInfo, and Scopus were searched for English-language publications from August 21, 2017 through April 28, 2018. Inclusion criteria were a primary outcome or thesis focused on suicide (including suicide completion, attempts, and thoughts or ideation) among medical students, postgraduate trainees, or attending physicians. Opinion articles were included. Studies that were non-English, or those that only mentioned physician burnout, mental health or substance use disorders were excluded. Data extraction was performed by two authors. Results: The search yielded 1,596 articles, of which 347 articles passed to the full-text review round. The oldest article was an editorial from 1903; 210 (60.3%) articles were published from 2000 to present. Authors originated from 37 countries and 143 (41.2%) were opinion articles. Most discussed were suicide risk factors and culture of practice issues, while least discussed themes included public health and postvention. Conclusions: Consistency and reliability of data and information about physician suicides could be improved. Data limitations partly contribute to these issues. Also, various suicide risk factors for physicians have been explored, and several remain poorly understood. Based on this scoping review, a public health approach, including surveillance and early warning systems, investigations of sentinel cases, and postvention may be impactful next steps in preventing physician deaths by suicide.","Leung, T.

229,"Evaluation of a rapid lateral flow calprotectin test for the diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection","Background: Microbiological diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection (PJI) relies on culture techniques that are slow and insensitive. Rapid tests are urgently required to improve patient management. Calprotectin is a neutrophil biomarker of inflammation that has been demonstrated to be effective for the diagnosis of PJI. A calprotectin based lateral flow test has been developed for the rapid detection of PJI using synovial fluid samples. Methods: A convenience series of 69 synovial fluid samples from patients at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals (NNUH) were collected intraoperatively from 52 hip and 17 knee revision operations. Calprotectin levels were measured using a new commercially available lateral flow assay for PJI diagnosis (Lyfstone). For all samples, synovial fluid was pipetted onto the lateral flow device and the signal was read using a mobile phone app after 15 minutes incubation at room temperature. Results: According to the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria, 24 patients were defined as PJI positive and the remaining 45 were negative. The overall accuracy of the lateral flow test against the MSIS criteria was 75%. The test had a sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 76% respectively with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 62% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 85%. Discordant results were then reviewed by the clinical team using available patient data to develop an alternative gold standard for defining presence/absence of infection (MSIS+). Compared to MSIS+, the test showed an overall accuracy of 83%, sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 78% respectively, a PPV of 62% and an NPV of 98%. Test accuracy for hip revisions was 77% and for knee revisions was 100%. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the calprotectin lateral flow assay is an effective diagnostic test for PJI. Our data suggests that the test is likely to generate false positive results in patients with metallosis and gross osteolysis.","Trotter, A. J.; Dean, R.; Whitehouse, C.

269,"Rationalising neurosurgical head injury referrals: The development and implementation of the Liverpool Head Injury Tomography Score (Liverpool HITS) for mild traumatic brain injury","Objectives: To develop and implement a radiological scoring system to define a surgically significant mild Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), stratify neurosurgical referrals and improve communication between referral centres and neurosurgical units. Design: Retrospective single centre case-control analysis of ten continuous months of mild TBI referrals. Setting: A major tertiary neurosurgery centre in England, UK. Participants: All neurosurgical referrals with a mild TBI (GCS 13-15) during the period of 1st January to 30th October 2017 were eligible for the study. 1248 patients were identified during the study period, with 1444 being included in the final analysis. Interventions: All patients CT head results from the referring centres were scored retrospectively using the scoring system and stratified according to their mean score, and if they were accepted for transfer to the neurosurgical centre or managed locally. Main outcome measure: Determine the discriminatory and diagnostic power, sensitivity and specificity of the scoring system for predicting a surgically significant mild TBI. Results: Most patients referred were male (59.4%, N=681), with a mean age of 69 years (SD=21.1). Of the referrals to the neurosurgical centre, 17% (n=195) were accepted for transfer and 83% (n=946) were not accepted. The scoring system was 99% sensitive and 51.9% specific for determining a surgically significant TBI. Diagnostic power of the model was fair with an area under the curve of 0.79 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.82). The score identified 495 (52.2%) patients in ten months of referrals that could have been successfully managed locally without neurosurgical referral if the scoring system was correctly used at the time of injury. Conclusion: The Liverpool Head Injury Tomography Score (HITS) score is a CT based scoring system that can be used to define a surgically significant mild TBI. The scoring system can be easily used by multiple healthcare professionals, has high sensitivity, will reduce neurosurgical referrals, and could be incorporated into local, regional and national head injury guidance.","Gillespie, C.

339,"Reactions to an Online Demonstration of the Effect of Increased Fruit and Vegetable Consumption on Appearance: Survey","Background. Inadequate fruit and vegetable consumption causes a considerable disease burden and premature mortality. Despite considerable public health promotion of a healthy diet the average consumption is still below recommended levels. Fruit and vegetable consumption influences human skin colour, increasing red/yellow/orange pigment in the skin. Given that this colour is deemed attractive and healthy looking, the appearance benefit may provide motivation to eat more fruit and vegetables. Such appearance motivation could be particularly effective in young individuals who currently eat least fruit and vegetables. Objectives. To assess how widely the impact of diet on skin colour is known within the UK. To compare the strength of motivation to eat fruit and vegetables based on health and appearance benefits and to compare the effect of different UK demographics on motivation. Methods. Four groups of UK residents (N = 200 each group) were recruited through the Prolific online platform. Groups comprised younger (aged 18 to 24) and older adults (aged 40 to 60) of low and high self-reported socioeconomic status (1 to 5 and 6 to 10 on a 10 point rating scale). Facial images simulating the skin colour associated with low and high fruit and vegetable diets were shown to participants. Questionnaires were used to assess (1) background knowledge of the health and skin colour effects of dietary fruit and vegetables; (2) the specific motivational impact of the skin colour illustration and (3) the relative importance of motivation to consume fruit and vegetables arising from health and skin colour appearance benefits. Results. (1) 61% of all participants were unaware of the dietary skin colour association. (2) 57% of participants found the simple demonstration of the dietary impact on skin colour positively motivating to eat more fruit and vegetables. The visual demonstration was equally motivating for participants of high and low self-reported socioeconomic status (P = .63) and different ethnic backgrounds (White N = 453, Black N = 182, Asian N = 87, P = .22). Health benefits from a diet high in fruit and vegetables were regarded as more motivating than skin colour appearance benefits. The appearance benefits of a high fruit and vegetable diet (compared to the health benefits) were relatively more important for the younger participants (Mann-Whitney U = 96,263, P < .001) and for women (N = 489) than for men (N = 310, U = 83,763, P = .01). Conclusions. These findings indicate that promotion of the skin colour effects of diets high in fruit and vegetables could provide additional motivation for a healthier diet. Our study indicates the wide appeal of appearance benefits from dietary fruit and vegetable (across ethnicity and socioeconomic status) and particularly amongst young adults where inadequate diet is most prevalent.","Cairns, P.; Ozakinci, G.; Perrett, D.

255,"Accuracy of Medical Billing Data Against the Electronic Health Record in the Measurement of Colorectal Cancer Screening Rates","Objective: Administrative healthcare data are an attractive source of secondary analysis because of their potential to answer population-health questions. Although these datasets have known susceptibilities to biases, the degree to which they can distort measurements like cancer screening rates are not widely appreciated, nor are their causes and possible solutions. Methods: Using a billing code database derived from our institution's electronic health records (EHR), we estimated the colorectal cancer screening rate of average-risk patients aged 50-74 seen in primary care or gastroenterology clinic in 2016-2017. 200 records (150 unscreened, 50 screened) were sampled to quantify the accuracy against manual review. Results: Out of 4,611 patients, an analysis of billing data suggested a 61% screening rate. Manual review revealed a positive predictive value of 96% (86-100%), negative predictive value of 21% (15-29%), and a corrected screening rate of 85% (81-90%). Most false negatives occurred due to exams performed outside the scope of the database - both within and outside of our institution - but 21% of false negatives fell within the database's scope. False positives occurred due to incomplete exams and inadequate bowel preparation. Reasons for screening failure include ordered but incomplete exams (48%), lack of or incorrect documentation by primary care (29%) including incorrect screening intervals (13%), and patients declining screening (13%). Conclusions: Although analytics on administrative data are commonly 'validated' by comparison to independent datasets, comparing our naive estimate to the CDC estimate (~60%) would have been misleading. Therefore, regular data audits using the complete EHR are critical to improve screening rates and measure improvement.","Rudrapatna, V. A.; Glicksberg, B.

258,"Characterizing traumatic brain injury and its association with homelessness in a community-based sample of precariously housed adults and youth","We characterized the prevalence, mechanisms, and sex difference of lifetime traumatic brain injury (TBI) in a precariously housed sample. We also examined the impact of TBI severity and timing on becoming and staying homeless. 285 precariously housed participants (adults n = 226, youths n = 59) completed the Brain Injury Screening Questionnaire (BISQ) in addition to other health assessments. A history of TBI was reported in 82.1% of the sample, with 64.6% reporting > 1 TBI, and 21.4% reporting a moderate or severe TBI (msTBI). 10.1% of adults had traumatically-induced lesions on MRI scans. Assault was the most common mechanism of injury overall, and females reported significantly more TBIs due to physical abuse than males (adjusted OR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.14 - 1.39, p = 9.18e-6). The first msTBI was significantly closer to the first experience of homelessness (b = 2.79, p = 0.003) and precarious housing (b = 2.69, p = 7.47e-4) than was the first mild TBI. Traumatic brain injuries more proximal to the initial loss of stable housing were associated with a longer lifetime duration of homelessness (RR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.02 - 1.06, p = 6.8e-6) and precarious housing (RR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01 - 1.04, p = 5.5e-10). These findings demonstrate the high prevalence of TBI in vulnerable persons and the severity- and timing-related risk that TBI may confer for the onset and prolongation of homelessness.","Stubbs, J.

228,"Atypical somatic symptoms in adults with prolonged recovery from mild traumatic brain injury","Somatization may contribute to persistent symptoms after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). In two independently-recruited study samples, we characterized the extent to which symptoms atypical of mTBI but typical for somatoform disorders (e.g., gastrointestinal upset, joint pain) were present in adult patients with prolonged recovery following mTBI. The first sample was cross-sectional and consisted of mTBI patients recruited from the community who reported ongoing symptoms attributable to a previous mTBI (n = 16) along with a healthy control group (n = 15). The second sample consisted of patients with mTBI prospectively recruited from a Level 1 trauma center who had either good recovery (GOSE = 8; n = 33) or poor recovery (GOSE < 8; n = 29). In all participants, we evaluated atypical somatic symptoms using the Patient Health Questionnaire-15 and typical post-concussion symptoms with the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire. Participants with poor recovery from mTBI had significantly higher 'atypical' somatic symptoms as compared to the healthy control group in Sample 1 (b = 4.308, p = 9.43E-5) and to mTBI patients with good recovery in Sample 2 (b = 3.287, p = 6.83E-04). As would be expected, participants with poor outcome in Sample 2 had a higher burden of typical rather than atypical symptoms (t(28) = 3.675, p = 9.97E-04, d = 0.94). However, participants with poor recovery still reported atypical somatic symptoms that were significantly higher (1.4 standard deviations, on average) than those with good recovery. Our results suggest that although 'typical' post-concussion symptoms predominate after mTBI, a broad range of somatic symptoms also frequently accompanies mTBI, and that somatization may represent an important, modifiable factor in mTBI recovery.","Stubbs, J.

272,"Genetic risk of obesity as a modifier of associations between neighbourhood environment and body mass index: an observational study of 335,046 UK Biobank participants","Background: There is growing recognition that recent global increases in obesity are the product of a complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. However, in gene-environment studies of obesity, ""environment"" usually refers to individual behavioural factors that influence energy balance, while more upstream environmental factors are overlooked. We examined gene-environment interactions between genetic risk of obesity and two neighbourhood characteristics likely to be associated with obesity (proximity to takeaway/fast-food outlets and availability of physical activity facilities). Methods: We used data from 335,046 adults aged 40-70 in the UK Biobank cohort to conduct a population-based cross-sectional study of interactions between neighbourhood characteristics and genetic risk of obesity, in relation to BMI. Proximity to a fast-food outlet was defined as distance from home address to nearest takeaway/fast-food outlet, and availability of physical activity facilities as the number of formal physical activity facilities within one kilometre of home address. Genetic risk of obesity was operationalised by 91-SNP and 69-SNP weighted genetic risk scores, and by six individual SNPs considered separately. Multivariable, mixed effects models with product terms for the gene-environment interactions were estimated. Results: After accounting for likely confounding, the association between proximity to takeaway/fast-food outlets and BMI was stronger among those at increased genetic risk of obesity, with evidence of an interaction with polygenic risk scores (P=0.018 and P=0.028 for 69-SNP and 91-SNP scores, respectively) and in particular with a SNP linked to MC4R (P=0.009), a gene known to regulate food intake. We found very little evidence of a gene-environment interaction for availability of physical activity facilities. Conclusions: Individuals at an increased genetic risk of obesity may be more sensitive to exposure to the local fast-food environment. Ensuring that neighbourhood residential environments are designed to promote a healthy weight may be particularly important for those with greater genetic susceptibility to obesity","Mason, K.

332,"Explaining the outcomes of the 'Clean India' campaign: institutional behaviour and sanitation transformation in India","Introduction: Whilst many less developed countries are struggling to provide universal access to safe sanitation, in the last five years India has almost reached its target of eliminating open defaecation. The object of this study was to understand how the Indian Government effected this sanitation transformation. Methods: The study employed interviews with 17 actors in the Governments Clean India programme across the national capital and four states which were analysed using a theory of change grounded in Behaviour Centred Design. Results: The Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) claims to have improved the coverage of toilets in rural India from 39% to over 95% of households between 2014 and mid 2019. From interviews with relevant actors we constructed a theory of change for the programme in which high-level political support and disruptive leadership changed environments in districts, which led to psychological changes in district officials, which, in turn, led to changed behaviour concerning sanitation programming. The Prime Ministers setting of the ambitious goal to eliminate open defecation by the 150th birthday of Mahatma Gandhi (October 2019) galvanised government bureaucracy, while early success in 100 flagship districts reduced the scepticism of government employees, a cadre of 500 young professionals placed in districts imparted new ideas and energy, social and mass media was used to engage and motivate the public and key players, and new norms of ethical behaviour were demonstrated by leaders. As a result, district officials engaged emotionally with the programme and felt pride at their achievements in ridding villages of open defecation. Conclusions: Though many challenges remain, Governments seeking to achieve the Sustainable Development Goal of universal access to safe sanitation can emulate the success of Indias Swachh Bharat Mission.","Curtis, V.",20190914,"Public And Global Health","10.1101/19004689",2,"Val Curtis","London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19004689v2?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19004689v2.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd","10.1136/bmjgh-2019-001892","Transcripts are not available because ethics requires anonymity"
206,"Generalisability of Results from UK Biobank: Comparison With a Pooling of 18 Cohort Studies","Background: The UK Biobank cohort study has become a much-utilised and influential scientific resource. With a primary goal of understanding disease aetiology, the low response to the original survey of 5.5% has, however, led to debate as to the generalisability of these findings. We therefore compared risk factor-disease estimations in UK Biobank with those from 18 nationally representative studies with conventional response rates. Methods: We used individual-level baseline data from UK Biobank (N=502,655) and a pooling of data from the Health Surveys for England (HSE) and the Scottish Health Surveys (SHS), comprising 18 studies and 89,895 individuals (mean response rate 68%). Both study populations were aged 40-69 years at study induction and linked to national cause-specific mortality registries. Findings: Despite a typically more favourable risk factor profile and lower mortality rates in UK Biobank participants relative to the HSE-SHS consortium, risk factors-endpoints associations were directionally consistent between studies, albeit with some heterogeneity in magnitude. For instance, for cardiovascular disease mortality, the age- and sex-adjusted hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for ever having smoked cigarettes (versus never) was 2.04 (1.87, 2.24) in UK Biobank and 1.99 (1.78, 2.23) in HSE-SHS, yielding a ratio of hazard ratios close to unity (1.02, 0.88, 1.19; p-value 0.76). For hypertension (versus none), corresponding results were again in same direction but with a lower effect size in UK Biobank (1.89; 1.69, 2.11) than in HSE-SHS (2.56; 2.20, 2.98), producing a ratio of hazard ratios below unity (0.74; 0.62, 0.89; p-value 0.001). A similar pattern of observations were made for risk factors (smoking, obesity, educational attainment, and physical stature) in relation to different cancer presentations and suicide whereby the ratios of hazard ratios ranged from 0.57 (0.40, 0.81) and 1.07 (0.42, 2.74). Interpretation: Despite a low response rate, aetiological findings from UK Biobank appear to be generalisable to England and Scotland.","Batty, G.

212,"Childhood coordination and survival up to six decades later: extended follow-up of participants in the National Child Development Study","Background: Poorer performance on standard tests of motor coordination in children has emerging links with sedentary behaviour, obesity, and functional capacity in later life. These observations are suggestive of an as-yet untested association of coordination with health outcomes. Objective: To examine the association of performance on a series of psychomotor coordination tests in childhood with mortality up to six decades later. Design, Setting, and Participants: The National Child Development Study (1958 birth cohort study) is a prospective cohort study based on a nationally representative sample of births from England, Scotland and Wales. A total of 17,415 individuals had their gross and fine motor psychomotor coordination assessed using nine tests at 11 and 16 years of age. Main outcome and measure: All-cause mortality as ascertained from a vital status registry and survey records. Results: Mortality surveillance between 7 and 58 years of age in an analytical sample of 17,336 men and women yielded 1,090 deaths. After adjustment for sex, higher scores on seven of the nine childhood coordination tests were associated with a lower risk of mortality in a stepwise manner. After further statistical control for early life socioeconomic, health, cognitive, and developmental factors, relations at conventional levels of statistical significance remains for three tests: ball catching at age 11 (hazard ratio; 95% confidence interval for 0-8 versus 10 catches: 1.56; 1.21, 2.01), match-picking at age 11 (>50 seconds versus 0-36: 1.33; 1.03, 1.70), and hopping at age 16 years (very unsteady versus very steady: 1.29; 1.02, 1.64).

Overall, 2176 private health insurance plans were included in this study. Consumer satisfaction with health insurance was consistently lowest in the West (p<0.0001). Lower private health insurance plan satisfaction was associated with the percentage of the population without a place of usual medical care, the percentage of the state population that is Hispanic, and the percentage of the population reporting any mental illness. Factors associated with increasing insurance satisfaction included higher healthcare spending per capita, a higher number of for-profit beds per capita, and an increased cancer death rate. Increased consumer satisfaction was associated with the Kaiser and Anthem insurance plan families. We reliably identified state and insurer-level factors that are predictive of private health insurance plan satisfaction. Potentially modifiable factors include access to primary care, healthcare spending per capita, and numbers of for-profit hospital beds. This information will help consumers hold insurance providers accountable to provide higher quality and more desirable coverage and provide actionable items to improve health insurance satisfaction.","Mcleod, M.

232,"Challenges in Building and Maintaining Rare Disease Patient Registries: Results of a Questionnaire Survey in Japan at 2012","[Background] Research infrastructure such as patient registries and biobanks is expected to play important roles by aggregating information and biospecimens to promote research and development for rare diseases. However, both building and maintaining them can be costly. This paper presents results of a survey of patient registries for rare diseases in Japan conducted at the end of 2012, with emphasis on clarifying costs and efforts related to building and maintaining them. [Results] Of 31 patient registries in Japan found by searching a database of research grant reports and by searching the internet, 11 returned valid responses to this survey. Results show that labor and IT system costs are major expenses for developing and maintaining patient registries. Half of the respondent patient registries had no prospect of securing a budget to maintain them. Responders required the following support for patient registries: financial support, motivation of registrants (medical doctors or patients), and improved communication with and visibility to potential data users. These results resemble those reported from another survey conducted almost simultaneously in Europe (EPIRARE survey). [Conclusions] Survey results imply that costs and efforts to build and maintain patient registries for many rare diseases make them unrealistic. Some alternative strategy is necessary to reduce burdens, such as offering a platform that supplies IT infrastructure and basic secretariat functions that can be used commonly among many patient registries.","Morita, M.; Ogishima, S.",20190817,"Health Informatics","10.1101/19004770",1,"Mizuki Morita","Okayama University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19004770v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19004770v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"na"
246,"Photo-Integrated Conversation Moderated by Robots for Cognitive Health in Older Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial","Background and Objectives: Social interaction might prevent or delay dementia, but little is known about the specific effects of various social activity interventions on cognition. This study conducted a single-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) of Photo-Integrated Conversation moderated by a Robot (PICMOR), a group conversation intervention program for resilience against cognitive decline and dementia. Research Design and Methods: In the RCT, PICMOR was compared to an unstructured group conversation condition. Sixty-five community-living older adults participated in this study. The intervention was provided once a week for 12 weeks. Primary outcome measures were the cognitive functions; process outcome measures included the linguistic characteristics of speech to estimate interaction quality. Baseline and post-intervention data were collected. PICMOR contains two key features: (i) photos taken by the participants are displayed and discussed sequentially; and (ii) a robotic moderator manages turn-taking to make sure that participants are allocated the same amount of time. Results: Among the primary outcome measures (i.e., cognitive functions), verbal fluency significantly improved in the intervention group. Among the process outcome measures (i.e., linguistic characteristics of speech), the amount of speech and richness of words were larger for the intervention group. Discussion and Implications: This study demonstrated for the first time the positive effects of a robotic social activity intervention on cognitive function in healthy older adults via RCT. The group conversation generated by PICMOR may improve participants cognitive function controlling the amount of speech produced to make it equal. PICMOR is available and accessible to community-living older adults.","Otake-Matsuura, M.; Tokunaga, S.; Watanabe, K.; Abe, M.

410,"AETIONOMY, a Cross-Sectional Study Aimed at validating a new taxonomy of Neurodegenerative Diseases: Study design and subject characteristics","Background: Although advances in the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) have led to improvements in classification and diagnosis and most importantly to new therapies, the unmet medical needs remain significant due to high treatment failure rates. The AETIONOMY project funded by the Innovative Medicine Initiative (IMI) aims at using multi-OMICs and bioinformatics to identify new classifications for NDDs based on common molecular pathophysiological mechanisms in view of improving the availability of personalised treatments. Objectives: The purpose of the AETIONOMY cross-sectional study is to validate novel patient classification criteria provided by these tools. Methods: This was a European multi centre, cross-sectional, clinical study conducted at 6 sites in 3 countries. Standardised clinical data, biosamples from peripheral blood, cerebrospinal fluid, skin biopsies, and data from a multi-OMICs approach were collected in patients suffering from Alzheimer and Parkinson disease, as well as healthy controls. Results: From September 2015 to December 2017 a total of 421 participants were recruited including 95 Healthy Controls. Nearly 1,500 biological samples were collected. The study achieved its objective with respect to Parkinson disease (PD) recruitment, however it was unable to recruit many new Alzheimer Disease (AD) patients. Overall, data from 413 evaluable subjects (405 PD and 8 AD) are available for analysis. PD patients and controls were well matched with respect to age (mean 63.4 years), however, close gender matching was not achieved. Approximately half of all PD patients and one At-Risk subject were taking dopamine agonists; rates of Levodopa usage were slightly higher (~60%). Median MDS-UPDRS Part III Scores (OFF state) ranged from 45 (SD 18) in those with Genetic PD to 2 (SD 3) in Healthy Controls. The standardised methodologies applied resulted in a high-quality database with very few missing data. Conclusion: This is one of the collaborative multi-OMICs studies in individuals suffering from PD and AD involving a control group. It is expected that the integration of data will provide new biomarker-led descriptions of clusters of patient subgroups.","Corvol, J.-C.; Bujac, S.; Carvalho, S.; Clarke, B.; Marovac, J.; Mangone, G.; Rascol, O.; Meissner, W.

695,"Association of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms with Dyslipidemia in Antiretroviral Exposed HIV Patients in a Ghanaian population","Dyslipidemia is a potential complication of long-term usage of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and also known to be associated with genetic factors. The host genetic variants associated with dyslipidemia HIV patients on ART in Ghana have not been fully explored. A total of 289 HIV-infected patients on stable ART for at least a year and 104 age-matched controls with no history of HIV and dyslipidemia were recruited for the study. Fasting blood was collected into EDTA for lipids measurements. Lipid profiles were determined as a measure of dyslipidemia. There was a significant difference in case-control prevalence for dyslipidemia (31.4% vs. 18.3%, p=0.013). Four candidate Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) from four genes (ABCA1-rs2066714, LDLR-rs6511720, APOA5-rs662799 and DSCAML1-rs10892151) were determined. Genotyping was performed on isolated genomic DNA of study participants using PCR followed by a multiplex Ligation Detection Reaction (LDR). Significantly increased levels of total cholesterol (TC) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides [TG] were observed in protease inhibitor-based (PI) treated case subjects compared to non-PI-based case subjects. The population frequency of homozygotes for the rare alleles rs6511720 (T/T), rs2066714 (G/G), rs10892151 (T/T) and rs662799 (G/G) were 3.6%, 9.6%, 6.4% and 6.0%, respectively. Adjusted analysis controlling for age, gender and duration of treatment revealed that rare homozygous genotypes for APOA5 (G/G) [aOR=18.74(5.65-54.73), p<0.0001], ABCA1 (G/G) [aOR=3.94(0.86 -17.38), p=0.033] and DSCAML1 (T/T) [aOR=11.46(3.651-43.56), p<0.0001) were significant factors for high TC. Subjects with the T/T genotype for DSCAML1 (rs10892151) were associated with a high likelihood of raised levels of LDL-C [aOR=3.76(1.43-8.46), p=0.033]. Furthermore, the rare homozygous genotype for ABCA1 (G/G) [aOR=5.67(3.43-13.54), p<0.0001] and LDLR (T/T) [aOR=4.46(1.86-10.56), p<0.0001) was significantly associated with hypertriglyceridemia. The study has demonstrated the presence of SNPs in four candidate genes among HIV patients exposed to ART in the Ghanaian population. SNPs were found to associate with dyslipidemia. These findings provide baseline information that necessitates a pre-symptomatic strategy for monitoring dyslipidemia in ART-treated HIV patients. There is a need for longitudinal studies to validate a comprehensive number of SNPs and its association with dyslipidemia.","Obirikorang, C.; Acheampong, E.; Quaye, L.; Yorke, J.; Amos-Abanyie, E.

277,"Classifying dementia progression using microbial profiling of saliva","Introduction: There is increasing evidence linking periodontal infections to Alzheimer's disease. Saliva sampling can reveal information about the host and pathogen interactions that can inform about physiological and pathological brain states. Methods: A cross-sectional cohort of age-matched subjects (78) was segmented according to their chemosensory (University of Pennsylvania smell identification test; UPSIT) and cognitive scores (mini-mental score evaluation; MMSE and clinical dementia rating; CDR). Mid-morning saliva was sampled from each subject and processed for microbiome composition and cytokine analysis. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to unravel specific changes in microbial and immunological signatures and logistic regression analysis (LRA) was employed to identify taxa that varied in abundance among patients' groups. Results: Using olfaction we distinguish in the cognitively normal population a segment with high chemosensory scores (CNh, 27) and another segment with chemosensory scores (CNr, 16) as low as MCI (21) but higher than the AD group (17). We could identify stage-specific microbial signatures changes but no clear distinct cytokine profiles. Periodontal pathogen species as F. villosus decline with increasing severity of AD while opportunistic oral bacteria as L. Wadei shows a significant enrichment MCI. Conclusions: The salivary microbiome indicates stage-dependent changes in oral bacteria favoring opportunistic bacteria at the expenses of periodontal bacteria, while the inflammatory profiles remain mainly unchanged in the sampled population.","Bathini, P.; Foucras, S.; Perna, A.; Doucey, M.-A.; Berreux, J.-L.; Annoni, J.-M.; Alberi, L.",20190829,"Neurology","10.1101/19004820",1,"Lavinia Alberi","Swiss Integrative Center for Human Health, Fribourg, Switzerland","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19004820v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19004820v1.full.pdf","cc_no","10.1002/dad2.12000","Raw Data available on request"
333,"The Implementation, Diagnostic Yield and Clinical Outcome of Genetic Testing on an Inpatient Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Service","Objective: Diagnostic genetic testing is recommended for children with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). However, many children with NDDs do not receive genetic testing. One approach to improve access to genetic services for these patients is to offer testing on the inpatient child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) service. Methods: We implemented systematic genetic testing on an inpatient CAP service by providing medical genetics education to CAP fellows. We compared the genetic testing rates pre- and post-education. We compared the diagnostic yield to previously published studies and the demographics of our cohort to inpatients who received genetic testing on other clinical services. We assessed rates of outpatient genetics follow-up post-discharge. Results: The genetic testing rate on the inpatient CAP service was 1.6% (2/125) before the educational intervention and 10.7% (21/197) afterwards (OR = 7.26, 95% CI = 1.72-65.12, p = 0.0015). Diagnostic yield for patients on the inpatient service was 4.3% (1/23), lower than previously reported. However, 34.8% (8/23) of patients had variants of unknown significance (VUSs). 39.1% (9/23) of children who received genetic testing while inpatients were underrepresented minorities, compared to 7.7% (1/13) of patients who received genetic testing on other clinical services (OR = 7.35, CI = 0.81-365.00, p = 0.057). 43.5% of patients were lost to outpatient genetics follow-up. Conclusion: Medical genetics education for fellows on an inpatient CAP service can improve genetic testing rates. Genetic testing for inpatients may primarily identify VUSs instead of well-known NDD risk variants. Genetic testing on the inpatient CAP service may improve access to genetic services for underrepresented minorities, but assuring outpatient follow-up can be challenging.","Besterman, A.

249,"Candidate molecular predictors of outcome after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage: a systematic review of haemoglobin metabolism, inflammation and oxidative injury pathways.","Aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (aSAH) is a devastating form of stroke associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Very little is known about the predictors of poor outcome and the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying neurological injury following aSAH. Three molecular pathways have been shown to be important: haemoglobin metabolism, inflammation and oxidative injury. The aim of this review is to use a systematic approach to identify a panel of key genes within these three pathways in order to focus future studies investigating predictors of poor outcome and the mechanisms of neurological injury following aSAH. Manual searching and bioinformatic mining tools were used. Studies of experimental or human SAH were included, and outcome was broadly defined to include all encountered readouts such as mortality, neurological scores, and neuropathological markers of tissue damage. If two or more molecules belonged to the same biochemical pathway, this pathway was examined in detail to identify all its components, which were then searched individually for any evidence of association with outcome using the same broad definition as before. This resulted in the identification of 58 candidate genes within the three pathways of interest (haemoglobin metabolism, inflammation and oxidative injury) potentially linked to outcome after aSAH.","Gaastra, B.; Galea, I.",20190822,"Neurology","10.1101/19004853",1,"Ben Gaastra","Wessex Neurological Centre, University Hospital Southampton, Southampton, UK","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19004853v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19004853v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"This is a systematic review."
248,"Dynamic Changes in Prescription Opioids from 2006 to 2017 in Texas","Study Objective: The US is experiencing an epidemic of opioid overdoses which may be at least partially due to an over-reliance on opioid analgesics in the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain and subsequent escalation to heroin or illicit fentanyl. As Texas was reported to be among the lowest in the US for opioid use and misuse, further examination of this state is warranted. Study Design: This study was conducted to quantify prescription opioid use in Texas. Data Source: Data was obtained from the publically available US Drug Enforcement Administration Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (ARCOS) which monitors controlled substances transactions from manufacture to commercial distribution. Results: Data for 2006 to 2017 from Texas for ten prescription opioids including eight primarily used to relieve pain (codeine, fentanyl, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, meperidine, morphine, oxycodone, oxymorphone) and two (buprenorphine and methadone) for the treatment of an Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) were examined. The change in Morphine Mg Equivalent (MME) of all opioids (+23.3%) was only slightly greater than the states population gains (21.1%). Opioids used to treat an OUD showed pronounced gains (+90.8%) which were four-fold faster than population growth. Analysis of individual agents revealed pronounced elevations in codeine (+387.5%), hydromorphone (+106.7%), and oxycodone (+43.6%) and a reduction in meperidine (-80.3%) in 2017 relative to 2006. Methadone in 2017 accounted for a greater portion (39.5%) of the total MME than hydrocodone, oxycodone, morphine, hydromorphone, oxymorphone, and meperidine, combined. There were differences between urban and rural areas in the changes in hydrocodone and buprenorphine. Conclusions: Collectively, these findings indicate that continued vigilance is needed in Texas to appropriately treat pain and an OUD while minimizing the potential for prescription opioid diversion and misuse. Texas may lead the US in a return to pre opioid crisis prescription levels.","Ighodaro, E. T.; Mccall, K. L.; Chung, D. Y.; Nichols, S. D.; Piper, B.

278,"Apolipoprotein B underlies the causal relationship of circulating blood lipids with coronary heart disease","Background: Circulating blood lipids cause coronary heart disease (CHD). However, the precise way in which one or more lipoprotein lipid-related entities account for this relationship remains unclear. We sought to explore the causal relationships of blood lipid traits with risk of CHD using multivariable Mendelian randomization. Methods: We conducted GWAS of circulating blood lipid traits in UK Biobank (up to n=440,546) for LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoprotein B to identify lipid-associated SNPs. Using data from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D for CHD (consisting of 60,801 cases and 123,504 controls), we performed univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. Similar analyses were conducted for HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I. Findings: GWAS identified multiple independent SNPs associated at P<5x10-8 for LDL cholesterol (220), apolipoprotein B (n=255), triglycerides (440), HDL cholesterol (534) and apolipoprotein AI (440). Between 56-93% of SNPs identified for each lipid trait had not been previously reported in large-scale GWAS. Almost half (46%) of these SNPs were associated at P<5x10-8 with more than one lipid related trait. Assessed individually using MR, each of LDL cholesterol (OR 1.66 per 1 standard deviation higher trait; 95%CI: 1.49; 1.86; P=2.4x10-19), triglycerides (OR 1.34; 95%CI: 1.25, 1.44; P=9.1x10-16) and apolipoprotein B (OR 1.73; 95%CI: 1.56, 1.91; P=1.5x10-25) had effect estimates consistent with a higher risk of CHD. In multivariable MR, only apolipoprotein B (OR 1.92; 95%CI: 1.31, 2.81; P=7.5x10-4) retained a robust effect with the estimate for LDL cholesterol (OR 0.85; 95%CI: 0.57; 1.27; P=0.44) reversing and that of triglycerides (OR 1.12; 95%CI: 1.02, 1.23; P=0.01) becoming markedly weaker. Individual MR analyses showed a 1-SD higher HDL-C (OR 0.80; 95%CI: 0.75, 0.86; P=1.7x10-10) and apolipoprotein A-I (OR 0.83; 95%CI: 0.77, 0.89; P=1.0x10-6) to lower the risk of CHD but these effect estimates weakened to include the null on accounting for apolipoprotein B. Conclusions: Apolipoprotein B is of fundamental causal relevance in the aetiology of CHD, and underlies the relationship of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides with CHD.","Richardson, T.

250,"Social Media Surveillance for Perceived Therapeutic Effects of Cannabidiol (CBD) Products","Background: CBD products have risen in popularity given CBD's therapeutic potential and lack of legal oversight, despite lacking conclusive scientific evidence for widespread over-the-counter usage for many of its perceived benefits. While medical evidence is being generated, social media surveillance offers a fast and inexpensive alternative to traditional surveys in ascertaining perceived therapeutic purposes and modes of consumption for CBD products. Methods: We collected all comments from the CBD subreddit posted between January 1 and April 30, 2019 as well as comments submitted to the FDA regarding regulation of cannabis-derived products and analyzed them using a rule-based language processing method. A relative ranking of popular therapeutic uses and product groups for CBD is obtained based on frequency of pattern matches including precise queries that entail identifying mentions of the condition, a CBD product, and some ""trigger"" phrase indicating therapeutic use. We validated the social media-based findings using a similar analysis on comments to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) 2019 request-for-comments on cannabis-derived products. Results: CBD is mostly discussed as a remedy for anxiety disorders and pain and this is consistent across both comment sources. Of comments posted to the CBD subreddit during the monitored time span, 6.19% mentioned anxiety at least once with at least 6.02% of these comments specifically mentioning CBD as a treatment for anxiety (i.e., 0.37% of total comments). The most popular CBD product group is oil and tinctures. Conclusion: Social media surveillance of CBD usage has the potential to surface new therapeutic use-cases as they are posted. Contemporary social media data indicate, for example, that stress and nausea are frequently mentioned as therapeutic use cases for CBD without corresponding evidence, that affirms or denies, in the research literature. However, the abundance of anecdotal claims warrants serious scientific exploration moving forward. Meanwhile, as FDA ponders regulation, our effort demonstrates that social data offers a convenient affordance to surveil for CBD usage patterns in a way that is fast and inexpensive and can inform conventional electronic surveys.","Tran, T.; Kavuluru, R.",20190822,"Health Informatics","10.1101/19004929",1,"Ramakanth Kavuluru","University of Kentucky","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19004929v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19004929v1.full.pdf","cc_no","10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.102688","Not applicable"
231,"A gene-diet interaction-based score predicts response to dietary fat in the Women's Health Initiative","While diet response prediction for cardiometabolic risk factors (CRFs) has been demonstrated using single SNPs and main-effect genetic risk scores, little investigation has gone into the development of genome-wide diet response scores. We sought to leverage the multi-study setup of the Women's Health Initiative cohort to generate and test genetic scores for the response of six CRFs (body mass index, systolic blood pressure, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and fasting glucose) to dietary fat. A genome-wide interaction study was undertaken for each CRF in women (n ~ 10000) not participating in the Dietary Modification (DM) trial, which focused on the reduction of dietary fat. Genetic scores based on these analyses were developed using a pruning-and-thresholding approach and tested for the prediction of one-year CRF changes as well as long-term chronic disease development in DM trial participants (n ~ 5000). One of these genetic scores, for LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), predicted changes in the associated CRF. This 1760-variant score explained 3.4% of the variance in one-year LDL-C changes in the intervention arm, but was unassociated with changes in the control arm. In contrast, a main-effect genetic risk score for LDL-C was not useful for predicting dietary fat response. Further investigation of this score with respect to downstream disease outcomes revealed suggestive differential associations across DM trial arms, especially with respect to coronary heart disease and stroke subtypes. These results lay the foundation for the combination of many genome-wide gene-diet interactions for diet response prediction while highlighting the need for further research and larger samples in order to achieve robust biomarkers for use in personalized nutrition.","Westerman, K.; Liu, Q.; Liu, S.; Parnell, L.

284,"Identification of host-pathogen-disease relationships using a scalable Multiplex Serology platform in UK Biobank","Background: Certain infectious agents are recognised causes of cancer and potentially other chronic diseases. Identifying associations and understanding pathological mechanisms involving infectious agents and subsequent chronic disease risk will be possible through measuring exposure to multiple infectious agents in large-scale prospective cohorts such as UK Biobank. Methods: Following expert consensus we designed a Multiplex Serology platform capable of simultaneously measuring quantitative antibody responses against 45 antigens from 20 infectious agents implicated in non-communicable diseases, including human herpes, hepatitis, polyoma, papilloma, and retroviruses, as well as Chlamydia trachomatis, Helicobacter pylori and Toxoplasma gondii. This panel was assayed in a random subset of UK Biobank participants (n=9,695) to test associations between infectious agents and recognised demographic and genetic risk factors and disease outcomes. Findings: Seroprevalence estimates for each infectious agent were consistent with those expected from the literature. The data confirmed epidemiological associations of infectious agent antibody responses with sociodemographic characteristics (e.g. lifetime sexual partners with C. trachomatis; P=1.8x10-149), genetic variants (e.g. rs6927022 with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) EBNA1 antibodies, P=9.5x10-91) and disease outcomes including human papillomavirus-16 seropositivity and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (odds ratio 2.28, 95% confidence interval 1.38-3.63), and quantitative EBV viral capsid antigen responses and multiple sclerosis through genetic correlation (MHC rG=0.30, P=0.01). Interpretation: This dataset, intended as a pilot study to demonstrate applicability of Multiplex Serology in epidemiological studies, is itself one of the largest studies to date covering diverse infectious agents in a prospective UK cohort including those traditionally under-represented in population cohorts such as human immunodeficiency virus-1 and C. trachomatis. Our results emphasise the validity of our Multiplex Serology approach in large-scale epidemiological studies opening up opportunities for improving our understanding of host-pathogen-disease relationships. These data are available to researchers interested in examining the relationship between infectious agents and human health.","Mentzer, A. J.; Brenner, N.; Allen, N.; Littlejohns, T. J.; Chong, A.

252,"Poor glycemic control and associated factors among diabetic patients in Ethiopia; A Systemic review and meta-analysis","Abstract Introduction The major global public health problems now days are diabetes especially the burden is high in low income countries including Ethiopia due to the limited resource for screening and early diagnosis of the diabetes. To prevent diabetic complications including organ damage and micro vascular complications blood glucose level should be maintained at an optimum level. However there was no pooled national picture on poor glycemic control and its associated factors. Methods Different data base searching engine including PubMed, Google scholar, the Cochrane library, MEDLINE,, HINARY and African journal online (AJOL) were used. The Joanna Briggs Critical Appraisal Tools and Newcastle Ottawa scale for assessing the quality of cross sectional studies were used for quality assessment. The meta-analysis was conducted using STATA 14 software. I2 statistic and egger weighted regression were used to assess heterogeneity and publication bias. Results A total of 134 studies were identified from different database searching engines and other sources. After removing for duplication, absence of abstract and review of the full text 12 studies were including in the meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of poor glycemic control among diabetic patients in Ethiopia is 64.72% with 95% confidence interval 63.16-66.28%. The sub group analysis of poor glycemic control among diabetic patients in different region of the country shows consistent and high prevalence of poor glycemic control ranging from 62.5% in Tigray region to 65.6% in Oromia region of the country. Residence, dyslipidemia and diet adherence were significantly association with poor glycemic control among diabetic patients in Ethiopia. Conclusion The prevalence of poor glycemic control among diabetic patients was high in Ethiopia and consistent across different regions of the country. The most important factors associated with poor glycemic factor among diabetic patients were being rural residence, having dyslipidemia and not adhering to dietary plan.

235,"Comparison of risk factors for coronary heart disease morbidity versus mortality","Owing to the often prohibitively high costs of medical examinations, or an absence of infrastructure for linkage of study members to morbidity registries, much aetiological research in the field of cardiovascular research relies on death records. Because they are regarded as being more distal to risk factor assessment than morbidity endpoints, mortality data are generally maligned in this context for seemingly providing less clear insights into aetiology. The relative utility of mortality versus morbidity registries is, however, untested. In a pooling of data from three large cohort studies whose participants had been linked to both death and morbidity registries for coronary heart disease, we related a range of established and emerging risk factors to these two methods of ascertainment. A mean duration of study member surveillance of 10.1 years (mortality) and 9.9 years (morbidity) for a maximum of 20,956 study members (11,868 women) in the analytical sample yielded 289 deaths from coronary heart disease and 770 hospitalisations for this condition. The direction of the age- and sex-adjusted association was the same for 21 of the 24 risk factor-morbidity/mortality combinations. The only marked discordance in effect estimates, such that different conclusions about the association could be drawn, was for social support, total cholesterol, and fruit/vegetable consumption whereby null effects were evident for selected outcomes. In conclusion, variation in disease definition typically did not have an impact on the direction of the association of an array of risk factors for coronary heart disease.","Batty, G.

251,"Multidrug therapy with terbinafine plus daily fluconazole is more effective than terbinafine alone or terbinafine plus weekly fluconazole in current epidemic of altered dermatophytosis in India: Results of a randomized pragmatic trial","Background: Treatment responsiveness of tinea has decreased considerably in recent past in India. We tested effectiveness of oral terbinafine daily plus fluconazole weekly (TFw) and terbinafine daily plus fluconazole daily (TFd) versus oral terbinafine daily (T) in tinea corporis, tinea cruris and tinea faciei in a pragmatic randomized open trial. Methods: One hundred and seventeen microscopy confirmed patients were allocated to T (6 mg/kg/day), TFw (terbinafine 6 mg/kg/day+fluconazole 12 mg/kg once weekly), or TFd (terbinafine 6 mg/kg/day+fluconazole 6 mg/kg/day) groups by concealed randomization and treated for 8 weeks or cure. Each group included 39 patients. Results: At 4 weeks, 9 (23.1%), 8 (20.5%) and 14 (35.9%) patients were cured in T, TFw and TFd groups, respectively (P=0.279). At 8 weeks, number of patients cured was as follows: T 13 (33.3%), TFw 18 (46.2%) and TFd 25 (64.1%). TFd was more effective than T (P=0.012), other comparisons were not significantly different. However, effect size as calculated by number needed to treat (NNT) (versus terbinafine) was 8 for TFw and 4 for TFd. Relapse rates one month after cure were similar in all groups (P=0.664). Conclusions: In view of cure rates and NNT, terbinafine plus daily fluconazole is more effective than terbinafine alone or terbinafine plus weekly fluconazole in current epidemic of altered dermatophytosis in India.","Singh, S.; Jha, B.; Shukla, P.; Anchan, V.

239,"Triage-based care of people with Back Pain: STarT Back or Start diagnosing? An observational study.","Objectives Back pain is a massive public health problem. The STarT Back Screening Tool (SBST) was developed for use in primary care to triage people with lumbar pain, classifying them as low, medium or high risk of prolonged symptoms. This classification guides non-surgical interventions including manual treatments, exercise and cognitive behavioural therapy. Claims suggest SBST brings generic health and cost benefits. National guidance recommends STarT Back is used at the first primary care consultation but can be used at any stage. For SBST to be an effective triage tool it should distinguish structural from non-structural pain. We tested this requirement in consecutive people referred to a single triage practitioner, hypothesising it was not possible conceptually. Design An observational study of the relationship between routine, prospectively collected triage data and diagnosis. Setting A secondary care spinal triage service based in a teaching hospital. Participants We studied consecutive referrals with lumbar pain triaged by a single extended scope practitioner (ESP) over 22 months (Nov 2015-Sept 2017). Main Outcome Measures SBST and pain visual analogue scores (VAS: 0-10) were collected at the initial consultation. We compared data for people with and without surgically remedial lesions. Results 1041 people were seen (61% female, mean age 53), n=234 (28%) had surgically amenable explanations for pain. People with surgical lesions were older (58 v 51yrs), more likely male (48 v 35%) and had higher VAS scores (6.8 v 6.1). Surgery and non-surgery subgroups had similar SBST total and domain score distribution profiles. The surgery subgroup had less low risk (9%v21%) and more high risk (37% v 30%) classified people. Conclusion SBST scores did not differentiate surgical from non-surgical pathologies. It seems unlikely that symptom questionnaires can estimate prognosis accurately unless everyone has the same diagnosis, not just the same symptom. Diagnosis, rather than questionnaire scores, should guide treatment and inform prognosis.","Germon, T.; Jack, A.; Hobart, J.",20190820,"Health Policy","10.1101/19005041",1,"Tim Germon","University Hospitals Plymouth","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005041v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005041v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"The data is routinely collected clinical data which in principle we are happy to share.

242,"Prevalence and clinical importance of titin truncating variants in adults without known congestive heart failure","Background: Cross-sectional studies of various forms of dilated cardiomyopathy have noted a truncating mutation in the gene encoding titin ('TTNtv') in 7-30% of patients, but the clinical importance of identifying a TTNtv in an asymptomatic adult is largely unknown. In contrast to cross-sectional studies, prospective cohort studies allow for unbiased estimates of the disease risks associated with a genotype exposure. Objectives: To determine the prevalence of cardiac imaging abnormalities and risk of incident disease among middle-aged TTNtv carriers without known congestive heart failure. Methods: We analyze exome sequencing data of 45,747 participants of the UK Biobank without known congestive heart failure to identify TTNtv carriers. Among 10,552 with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we determine the relationship between TTNtv carrier status and left ventricular ejection fraction. In this prospective cohort, we quantify the absolute and relative risks of incident disease in TTNtv carriers versus noncarriers. Results: Among 45,747 middle-aged participants without known congestive heart failure, 196 (0.43%) harbored a TTNtv. The average ejection fraction was 61% in TTNtv carriers versus 65% in noncarriers (P = 1.8 10-8), with a 9.3-fold increase (95% CI 3.9 - 22.2) in odds of subnormal ejection fraction (P = 5.7 10-5). Over a median follow-up of 6.9 years, a composite endpoint of incident dilated cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, or all-cause mortality was observed in 6.6% of TTNtv carriers versus 2.9% of non-carriers (adjusted hazard ratio 2.5; 95% CI 1.4 - 4.3; p = 1.1 10-3). Conclusions: Approximately 1 in 230 middle-aged adults without known congestive heart failure harbored a TTNtv. These carriers had a substantially increased relative risk-but modest absolute risk-of having a subnormal ejection fraction or manifesting clinical disease during prospective follow-up.","Pirruccello, J.

243,"An Analysis for Key Indicators of Reproducibility in Radiology","Abstract: Background: Given the central role of radiology in patient care, it is important that radiological research is grounded in reproducible science. It remains unexamined whether there is a lack of reproducibility or transparency in radiologic research. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to analyze published radiology literature for the presence or absence of key indicators of reproducibility. Methods: This cross-sectional, retrospective study was performed by conducting a search of the National Library of Medicine to identify publications contained within journals in the field of Radiology. Journals that were not written in English or MEDLINE indexed were excluded from the analysis. Studies published from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2018 were used to generate a random list of 300 publications for this meta-analysis. A pilot-tested, Google form was used to evaluate key indicators of reproducibility in the queried publications. Results: Our initial search returned 295,543 records, from which 300 were randomly selected for analysis. Of these 300 records, 294 met the inclusion criteria. Among the empirical publications, 5.6% contained a data availability statement (11/195, 95% CI: 3.0-8.3), 0.51% provided clearly documented raw data (1/195), 12.0% provided a materials availability statement (23/191, 8.4-15.7), none provided analysis scripts, 4.1% provided a preregistration statement (8/195, 1.9-6.3), 2.1% provided a protocol statement (4/195, 0.4-3.7), and 3.6% were preregistered (7/195, 1.5-5.7). Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that key indicators of reproducibility are missing in the field of radiology. Thus, the ability to reproduce radiological studies may be problematic and may have potential clinical implications.","Wright, B.; Vo, N.; Nolan, J.; Johnson, A.

237,"Measuring stroke outcomes using linked administrative data: Population-based estimates and validation of home-time as a surrogate measure of functional status.","Abstract Background: Administrative data offer cost-effective, whole-of-population stroke surveillance yet the lack of validated outcomes is a short-coming. The number of days spent living at home after stroke (home-time) is a patient-centred outcome that can be objectively ascertained from administrative data. Population-based validation against both severity and outcome measures and for all subtypes is lacking. Methods: Stroke hospitalisations from a state-wide census in New South Wales, Australia, from July 1, 2005 to March 31, 2014 were linked to pre-hospital data, post-stroke admissions and deaths. We calculated correlations between 90-day home-time and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores, measured upon initial contact with paramedics, and Functional Independence Measure (FIM) scores, measured upon entry to rehabilitation after the acute hospital stroke admission. Negative binomial regressions were used to identify predictors of home-time. Results: Patients with stroke (N=74,501) spent a median of 53 days living at home after the event. Median home-time was 60 days after ischaemic stroke, 49 days after subarachnoid haemorrhage and 0 days after intracerebral haemorrhage. GCS and FIM scores significantly correlated with home-time (p-values<0.001). Female sex predicted less home-time in ischaemic stroke, while being married increased home time after ischaemic stroke and subarachnoid haemorrhage. Conclusions: Home-time measured using administrative data is a robust, replicable and valid patient-centred outcome enabling inexpensive population-based surveillance.","Gattellari, M.; Goumas, C.; Jalaludin, B.; Worthington, J.",20190820,"Health Informatics","10.1101/19005082",1,"Melina Gattellari","Department of Neurology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, New South Wales, Australia","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005082v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005082v1.full.pdf","cc_no","10.1111/ijcp.13484","Data analysed as part of this study are third-party owned.

264,"Epigenome-wide association study of seizures in childhood and adolescence","The occurrence of seizures in childhood is often associated with neurodevelopmental impairments and school underachievement. Common genetic variants associated with epilepsy have been identified and epigenetic mechanisms have also been suggested to play a role. In this study we analysed the association of genome-wide blood DNA methylation with the occurrence of seizures in ~800 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, UK, at birth (cord blood), during childhood and adolescence (peripheral blood). We also analysed the association between the lifetime occurrence of any seizures before age 13 with blood DNA methylation levels. We sought replication of the findings in the Generation R Study and explored causality using Mendelian randomization, i.e. using genetic variants as proxies. The results showed five CpG sites which were associated cross-sectionally with seizures either in childhood or adolescence (1-5% absolute methylation difference at pFDR<0.05), although the evidence of replication in an independent study was weak. One of these sites was located in the BDNF gene, which is highly expressed in the brain, and showed high correspondence with brain methylation levels. The Mendelian randomization analyses suggested that seizures might be causal for changes in methylation rather than vice-versa. In addition, seizure-associated methylation changes could affect other outcomes such as growth, cognitive skills and educational attainment. In conclusion, we present a link between seizures and DNA methylation which suggests that DNA methylation changes might mediate some of the effects of seizures on growth and neurodevelopment.","Caramaschi, D.; Hatcher, C.; Mulder, R.; Felix, J.; Cecil, C.; Relton, C.; Walton, E.",20190826,"Epidemiology","10.1101/19005116",1,"Doretta Caramaschi","University of Bristol","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005116v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005116v1.full.pdf","cc_by","10.1186/s13148-019-0793-z","The ALSPAC study website contains details of all the data that is available through a fully searchable data dictionary and variable search tool."
331,"The Mezurio smartphone application: Evaluating the feasibility of frequent digital cognitive assessment in the PREVENT dementia study","Background: Smartphones may significantly contribute to the detection of early cognitive decline at scale by enabling remote, frequent, sensitive, economic assessment. Several prior studies have sustained engagement with participants remotely over a period of a week; extending this to a period of a month would clearly give greater opportunity for measurement. However, as such study durations are increased, so too is the need to understand how participant burden and scientific value might be optimally balanced. Objectives: We explore the 'little but often' approach to assessment employed by the Mezurio app, interacting with participants every day for over a month. We aim to understand whether this extended remote study duration is feasible, and which factors might promote sustained participant engagement over such study durations. Methods: Thirty-five adults (aged 40-59 years) with no diagnosis of cognitive impairment were prompted to interact with the Mezurio smartphone app platform for up to 36 days, completing short, daily episodic memory tasks in addition to optional executive function and language tests. A subset (n=20) completed semi-structured interviews focused on their experience using the app. Results: Average compliance with the schedule of learning for subsequent memory test was 80%, with 88% of participants still actively engaged by the final task. Thematic analysis of participants' experiences highlighted schedule flexibility, a clear user-interface, and performance feedback as important considerations for engagement with remote digital assessment. Conclusions: Despite the extended study duration, participants demonstrated high compliance with the tasks scheduled and were extremely positive about their experiences. Long durations of remote digital interaction are therefore definitely feasible, but only when careful attention is paid to the design of the user experience.","Lancaster, C.; Koychev, I.; Blane, J.; Chinner, A.; Wolters, L.; Hinds, C.",20190914,"Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology","10.1101/19005124",2,"Claire Lancaster","University of Oxford","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005124v2?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005124v2.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"The data contained within this article is not publicly available."
287,"Clinical benefits and adverse effects of genetically-elevated free testosterone levels: a Mendelian randomization analysis","BACKGROUND: Testosterone products are increasingly being prescribed to males for a variety of possible health benefits but the causal relationship between testosterone and health-related outcomes is unclear. Evidence from well-powered randomized controlled trials are difficult to obtain, particularly regarding effects on long-term or adverse outcomes. We sought to determine the effects of genetically-predicted calculated free testosterone (CFT) on 23 health outcomes. METHODS: Genetic variants associated with CFT were determined from 136,531 white British males in the UK Biobank. One-sample and two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to infer the effects of genetically-predicted CFT on 23 health outcomes selected based on relevance with known or suspected effects of testosterone therapy. FINDINGS: In males from the UK Biobank, 81 independent genetic variants were associated with CFT levels at genome-wide significance (p<5x10-8). Each 0.1 nmol/L increase in genetically-predicted CFT was associated with clinical benefits on increased heel bone mineral density (0.053 SD; 95% CI = 0.038 to 0.068; p=8.77x10-12) and decreased body fat percentage (-1.86%; 95% CI = -2.35 to -1.37; p=1.56x10-13), and adverse effects on increased risk of prostate cancer (OR=1.28; 95% CI=1.11 to 1.49; p=1.0x10-3), risk of androgenic alopecia (OR=1.82; 95% CI = 1.55 to 2.14; p=3.52x10-13), risk of benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) (OR=1.81; 95% CI = 1.34 to 2.44; p=1.05x10-4) and hematocrit percentage (1.49%; 95% CI = 1.24 to 1.74; p=3.49x10-32). CONCLUSIONS: Long-term elevated free testosterone levels cause prostate cancer, BPH, and hair loss while reducing body fat percentage and increasing bone density. It also has a neutral effect on type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular and cognitive outcomes. Well powered randomized trials are needed to address the effects of shorter term use of exogenous testosterone on these outcomes.","Mohammadi-Shemirani, P.; Chong, M.; Pigeyre, M.; Morton, R.

300,"Opioid Overdose in Ohio: Comprehensive Analysis of Associated Socioeconomic Factors","Objective: Our study focused on identifying socioeconomic factors associated with death by opioid overdose in Ohio communities at the census tract level. Materials and Methods: A large-scale vital statistic dataset from Ohio Department of Health (ODH) and U.S. Census datasets were used to obtain opioid-related death rate and socioeconomic characteristics for all census tracts in Ohio. Regression analysis was performed to identify the relationships between socioeconomic factors of census tracts and the opioid-related death rate for both urban and rural tracts. Results: In Ohio from 2010-2016, whites, males, and people aged 25-44 had the highest opioid-related death rates. At the census tract level, higher death rates were associated with certain socioeconomic characteristics (e.g. percentage of the census tract population living in urban areas, percentage divorced/separated, percentage of vacant housing units). Predominately rural areas had a different population composition than urban areas, and death rates in rural areas exhibited fewer associations with socioeconomic characteristics. Discussion: Predictive models of opioid-related death rates based on census tract-level characteristics held for urban areas more than rural ones, reflecting the recently observed rural- to- urban geographic shift in opioid-related deaths. Future research is needed to examine the geographic distribution of opioid abuse throughout Ohio and in other states. Conclusion: Regression analysis identified associations between population characteristics and opioid-related death rates of Ohio census tracts. These analyses can help government officials and law official workers prevent, predict and combat opioid abuse at the community level.","Park, C.; Crawford, S.; Lopez, R.; Seballos, A.; Clemenceau, J.; Coy, T.; Atluri, G.; Hwang, T.

341,"Dose-dependent degeneration of non-cancerous brain tissue in post-radiotherapy patients: A diffusion tensor imaging study","Background and purpose: Radiation-induced changes in brain tissue may relate to post-radiotherapy (RT) cognitive decline. Our aim is to investigate changes of the brain microstructural properties after exposure to radiation during clinical protocols of RT using diffusion MRI (dMRI). Methods and Materials: The susceptibility of tissue changes to radiation was investigated in a clinically heterogenic cohort (age, pathology, tumor location, type of surgery) consisting of 121 scans of 18 patients (10 females). The imaging dataset included 18 planning CTs and 103 dMRI scans (range 2-14, median = 6 per patient) assessing pre-operative, post-operative pre-RT and post-RT states. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics were estimated from all scans for a region-of-interest based linear relation analysis between mean dose and change in DTI metrics, while partial volume effects were regressed out. Results: The largest regional dose dependency with mean diffusivity appear in the white matter of the frontal pole in the left hemisphere by an increase of 2.61 %/(Gy x year). Full brain-wise, pooled results for white matter show fractional anisotropy to decrease by 0.85 %/(30Gy x year); mean diffusivity increase by 9.17 %/(30Gy x year); axial diffusivity increase by 7.30%/(30Gy x year) and radial diffusivity increases by 10.63%/(30Gy x year). Conclusions: White matter is susceptible to radiation with some regional variability where diffusivity metrics demonstrate the largest relative sensitivity.

404,"The consistent burden in published estimates of delirium occurrence in medical inpatients over four decades: a systematic review and meta-analysis study","Introduction Delirium is associated with a wide range of adverse patient safety outcomes. We sought to identify if trends in healthcare complexity were associated with changes in reported delirium in adult medical patients in the general hospital over the last four decades. Methods We used identical criteria to a previous systematic review, including studies using DSM and ICD-10 criteria for delirium diagnosis. Random effects meta-analysis pooled estimates across studies, meta-regression estimated temporal changes, funnel plots assessed publication bias. Results Overall delirium occurrence was 23% (95% CI 19%-26%) (33 studies). There was no change between 1980-2019, nor was case-mix (average age of sample, proportion with dementia) different. There was evidence of increasing publication bias over time. Discussion The incidence and prevalence of delirium in hospitals appears to be stable, though publication bias may mask true changes. Nonetheless, delirium remains a challenging and urgent priority for clinical diagnosis and care pathways.","Gibb, K.; Seeley, A.; Quinn, T.; Siddiqi, N.; Shenkin, S.; Rockwood, K.; Davis, D.",20190926,"Geriatric Medicine","10.1101/19005165",2,"Daniel Davis","UCL","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005165v2?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005165v2.full.pdf","cc_by","10.1093/ageing/afaa040","Data used in this manuscript are publicly available."
820,"Characteristics of Cardiac Memory in Patients with Implanted Cardioverter Defibrillator: the CAMI study","Background: Cardiac memory (CM) was known as a repolarization phenotype, an adaptive response of the heart on abnormal ventricular activation. The goal of this study was to determine factors associated with CM in patients receiving implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD). We hypothesized that preexisted cardiac remodeling is associated with CM. Methods: Patients with structural heart disease (n=20; mean age 72.6 {+/-} 11.6 y; 80% male; mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 31.7 {+/-} 7.6%; history of myocardial infarction (MI) in 75%, ventricular tachycardia (VT) in 85%) and preserved atrioventricular (AV) conduction received primary (80%) or secondary (20%) prevention dual chamber ICD. Standard 12-lead ECG was recorded in AAI and DDD mode, immediately after ICD implant and after 7 days of right ventricular (RV) pacing in DDD mode with short AV delay. Direction (azimuth and elevation) and magnitude of spatial QRS, T, and ventricular gradient (SVG) vectors were measured immediately after implant and after 7 days of RV pacing. CM was quantified as the degree of alignment between QRSDDD-7 and TAAI-7 vectors (QRSDDD-7-TAAI-7 angle). Circular statistics and mixed models with a random slope and intercept were adjusted for days 1-7 change in cardiac activation, LVEF, known risk factors, and use of medications known to affect CM. Results: QRSDDD-7-TAAI-7 angle strongly correlated (circular r = - 0.972; P<0.0001) with TAAI-7-TDDD-7 angle. Baseline TDDD-1 azimuth correlated with QRSAAI-7-QRSDDD-7 angle (circular r = 0.604; P<0.001). In the mixed models, history of MI (-180(95%CI -320 to -40 {degrees} ); P=0.011) and female sex (-162(95%CI -268 to -55 {degrees} ); P=0.003) counteracted CM-T azimuth changes (+132(95%CI 80-184 {degrees} ); P<0.0001). History of VT (+27(95%CI 4-46) mV*ms; P=0.007) amplified CM-T area increase (+15(95%CI 6-24) mV*ms; P<0.0001). Conclusions: Existing cardiac remodeling due to MI and VT significantly affect the degree of CM in response to RV pacing. Women develop less CM than men. Activation memory manifests as a smaller angle between QRS vectors of normal and abnormal activation.","Haq, K.; Cao, J.; Tereshchenko, L.

274,"Pre-diagnostic loss to follow-up in an active case-finding TB program: a mixed-methods study from rural Bihar, India","Background Despite active case-finding (ACF) identifying more presumptive and confirmed TB cases, high pre-diagnostic loss to follow-up (PDLFU) among presumptive TB cases referred for diagnostic test remains a concern. We aimed to quantify the PDLFU, and identify the barriers and enablers in undergoing a diagnostic evaluation in an ACF program implemented in 1.02 million rural population in the Samastipur district of Bihar, India. Methods During their routine work, Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA, a community health worker or CHW), informal providers, and community laypersons identified people at risk of TB, and referred them to the program. A field coordinator (FC) screened them for TB symptoms at the patient's home. The identified presumptive TB cases were accompanied by the CHW to a designated government facility for diagnostics. Those with a confirmed TB diagnosis were put on treatment by the CHW and followed-up till treatment completion. All services were provided free of cost and patients were supported throughout the care pathway, including a transport allowance. We analyzed programmatically collected data, conducted in-depth interviews with patients, and focus group discussions with the CHWs and FCs in an explanatory mixed-methods design. Results A total of 11146 presumptive TB cases were identified from January 2018 to December 2018, out of which 4912 (44.1%) underwent a diagnostic evaluation. The key enablers were CHW accompaniment and support in addition to the free TB services in the public sector. The major barriers identified were transport challenges, deficient family and health provider support, and poor services in the public system. Conclusion If we are to find missing cases, the health system needs urgent reform, and diagnostic services need to be patient-centric. A strong patient support system engaging all stakeholders and involvement of CHWs in routine TB care is an effective solution.","Garg, T.; Gupta, V.; Sen, D.; Verma, M.; Brouwer, M.; Mishra, R.; Bhardwaj, M.",20190827,"Public And Global Health","10.1101/19005199",1,"Tushar Garg","Innovators In Health","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005199v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005199v1.full.pdf","cc_by",NA,"The deidentified data used in the study is available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

283,"The Impact of Pre-exposure Prophylaxis for Human Immunodeficiency Virus on Gonorrhea Prevalence","Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been shown to be highly effective in reducing the risk of HIV infection in gay and bisexual men who have sex with men (GbMSM). However, PrEP does not protect against other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). In some populations, PrEP has also led to riskier behaviour such as reduced condom usage, with the result that the prevalence of bacterial STIs like gonorrhea has increased. Here we develop a compartmental model of the transmission of HIV and gonorrhea, and the impacts of PrEP, condom usage, STI testing frequency and potential changes in sexual risk behaviour stemming from the introduction of PrEP in a population of GbMSM. We find that introducing PrEP causes an increase in gonorrhea prevalence for a wide range of parameter values, including at the current recommended frequency of STI testing once every 3 months for individuals on PrEP. Moreover, the model predicts that a higher STI testing frequency alone is not enough to prevent a rise in gonorrhea prevalence, unless the testing frequency is increased to impractical levels. However, testing every 2 months in combination with sufficiently high condom usage by individuals on PrEP would be successful in maintaining gonorrhea prevalence at pre-PrEP levels. The results emphasize that programs making PrEP more available should be accompanied by efforts to support condom usage and frequent STI testing, in order to avoid an increase in the prevalence of gonorrhea and other bacterial STIs.","Pharaon, J.; Bauch, C.

288,"Identifying subtypes of a stigmatized medical condition","Background: Some conditions - such as obesity, depression and functional odor disorders - come with a social stigma. Understanding the etiology of these conditions helps to avoid stereotypes and find remedies. One of the major obstacles facing researchers, especially for those studying socially distressing metabolic malodor, is the difficulty in assembling biologically homogeneous study cohorts. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine phenotypic variance, self-reported data and laboratory tests for the purpose of identifying clinically relevant and etiologically meaningful subtypes of idiopathic body odor and the 'People are Allergic To Me' (PATM) syndrome. Methods: Participants with undiagnosed body odor conditions enrolled to participate in this research study initiated by a healthcare charity MEBO Research and sponsored by Wishart Research group at the Metabolomics Innovation Centre, University of Alberta, Canada. Primary outcomes were differences in metabolite concentrations measured in urine, blood and breath of test and control groups. Principal component analyses and other statistical tests were carried out for these measurements. Results: While neither of existing laboratory tests could reliably predict chronic malodor symptoms, several measurements distinguished phenotypes at a significance level less than 5%. Types of malodor can be differentiated by self-reported consumption of (or sensitivity to) added sugars (p<0.01), blood alcohols after glucose challenge (especially ethanol: p<0.0005), urinary excretion of phenylalanine, putrescine, and combinations of blood or urine metabolites. Conclusions: Our preliminary results suggest that malodor heterogeneity can be addressed by analyses of phenotypes based on patients' dietary and olfactory observations. Our studies highlight the need for more trials. Future research focused on comprehensive metabolomics and microbiome sequencing will play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of malodor.","Gabashvili, I.",20190829,"Endocrinology","10.1101/19005223",1,"Irene Gabashvili","Aurametrix, MEBO Research","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005223v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005223v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nd",NA,"Data is available from this location:"
309,"Against Empathy: distinct correlates of empathy and compassion with burnout and affective symptoms in health professionals and students","Concern for the well-being of medical professionals has increased considering the high rates of depression and suicidal ideation observed among medical students and residents. However, the causes of such psychological distress among health professionals are still unknown. One possibility is that such negative outcomes arise from individual differences in how clinicians respond to the emotional states of their patients: while some tend respond with empathy (feeling what others feel), others tend respond with compassion (caring about what others feel). The aim of this study is to investigate the hypothesis that empathy is related to higher levels of burnout and affective symptoms, while compassion is related to lower levels of these outcomes. We surveyed 464 undergraduate students and professionals in medicine (34.3%), psychology (47%) and nursing (18.8%), 79.7% female, with a median age of 23.3. The survey included the concern and perspective taking subscales from the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI); empathy and behavioral contagion from the Empathy Index (EI); the depression, anxiety, and anger subscales from PROMIS; and the Medical Student Well-Being Index (MSWBI). Empathy was associated with higher symptoms of burnout, depression, anxiety and anger; while higher levels of compassion were associated with lower levels of these outcomes. Our findings provide new evidence that the well-being of medical professionals might be affected differently depending on socio-emotional traits relevant to emotional connection.","Romani-Sponchiado, A.; Jordan, M.; Stringaris, A.; Salum, G.

260,"Impairment of dual-task gait dynamics in older adults with mild cognitive impairment: Relationships to neuropsychological status, fitness and brain morphology","Background: Individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) have more gait variability under dual-task conditions than cognitively healthy adults. However, characteristics associated with this susceptibility of gait to dual-task stress are unknown. Methods: Testing was performed at baseline in the Study of Mental And Resistance Training (SMART). Ninety-three adults with MCI (age 70{+/-}6.8 years; 66.6% female) performed a single- and dual-task walk (cognitive distractor=letter fluency), in random order. Linear and non-linear gait variability were measured using force-sensitive insoles. Cognitive performance during dual-tasking was assessed by the number of correct words vocalized. Cognitive function, brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), muscle strength, aerobic capacity, body composition, physical and psychosocial function were also assessed as potential correlates of gait dynamics. Results: Gait dynamics worsened during dual-tasking, with decrements in both stride time variability (p<0.001) and detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) (p=0.001). Lower aerobic capacity and thinner posterior cingulate cortex were associated with greater decrements in DFA (p<0.05). Smaller hippocampal volume, worse psychological well-being and poorer static balance were associated with greater decrements in stride time variability (p<0.05). By contrast, cognitive performance did not change under dual-task conditions compared to seated testing (p=0.13). Conclusions: Under dual-task conditions, participants with MCI preserved their cognitive performance at the expense of gait stability. Decrements in dual-tasking gait were associated with lower aerobic fitness, balance, psychological well-being, and brain volume in cognitively-relevant areas of the posterior cingulate and hippocampus, all potentially modifiable characteristics. Trials of targeted interventions are needed to determine the potential plasticity of gait variability in high-risk cohorts.","Hawkins, T. C.; Samuel, R.; Fiatarone Singh, M. A.; Gates, N.; Wilson, G.

734,"Evaluation of Patient-Level Retrieval from Electronic Health Record Data for a Cohort Discovery Task","Objective Growing numbers of academic medical centers offer patient cohort discovery tools to their researchers, yet the performance of systems for this use case is not well-understood. The objective of this research was to assess patient-level information retrieval (IR) methods using electronic health records (EHR) for different types of cohort definition retrieval. Materials and Methods We developed a test collection consisting of about 100,000 patient records and 56 test topics that characterized patient cohort requests for various clinical studies. Automated IR tasks using word-based approaches were performed, varying four different parameters for a total of 48 permutations, with performance measured using B-Pref. We subsequently created structured Boolean queries for the 56 topics for performance comparisons. In addition, we performed a more detailed analysis of 10 topics. Results The best-performing word-based automated query parameter settings achieved a mean B-Pref of 0.167 across all 56 topics. The way a topic was structured (topic representation) had the largest impact on performance. Performance not only varied widely across topics, but there was also a large variance in sensitivity to parameter settings across the topics. Structured queries generally performed better than automated queries on measures of recall and precision, but were still not able to recall all relevant patients found by the automated queries. Conclusion While word-based automated methods of cohort retrieval offer an attractive solution to the labor-intensive nature of this task currently used at many medical centers, we generally found suboptimal performance in those approaches, with better performance obtained from structured Boolean queries. Insights gained in this preliminary analysis will help guide future work to develop new methods for patient-level cohort discovery with EHR data.","Chamberlin, S. R.; Bedrick, S. D.; Cohen, A.

330,"Transmission Dynamics of and Insights from the 2018-2019 Measles Outbreak in New York City: A Modeling Study","In 2018-2019, New York City experienced the largest measles outbreak in the US in nearly three decades. To identify key factors contributing to this outbreak to aid future public health interventions, here we developed a model-inference system to infer the transmission dynamics of measles in the affected community, based on incidence data. Our results indicate that delayed vaccination of young children aged 1-4 years enabled the initial spread of measles and that increased infectious contact among this age group, likely via gatherings intended to expose unvaccinated children (i.e. ""measles parties""), further aggravated the outbreak and led to widespread of measles beyond this age group. We found that around half of infants were susceptible to measles by age 1 (the age-limit to receive the first vaccine dose in the US); as such, infants experienced a large number of infections during the outbreak. We showed that without the implemented vaccination campaigns, the outbreak severity including numbers of infections and hospitalizations would be 10 times higher and predominantly affect infants and children under 4. These results suggest that recommending the first vaccine dose before age 1 and the second dose before age 4 could allow pro-vaccine parents to vaccinate and protect infants and young children more effectively, should high level of vaccine hesitancy persist. In addition, enhanced public health education is needed to reduce activities that unnecessarily expose children to measles and other infections.","Yang, W.",20190914,"Epidemiology","10.1101/19005298",2,"Wan Yang","Columbia University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005298v2?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005298v2.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"All related data are publicly available at the NYC DOHMH website (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/measles.page)."
259,"Relationship between early childhood non-parental childcare and diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and sleep: A systematic review of longitudinal studies","Background: The rising prevalence of childhood obesity is a global public health concern. Evidence suggests that exposure to non-parental childcare before age six years is associated with increased risk of obesity, diet, and activity behaviours (physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and sleep). However, findings are inconsistent and mostly from cross-sectional studies, making it difficult to identify the direction of causation in associations. This review identified and synthesised the published research on longitudinal associations between non-parental childcare during early childhood, diet, and activity behaviours. Methods: Seven databases were searched using a predefined search strategy. Results were independently double-screened through title/abstract and full-text stages according to predefined criteria. Included studies were tabulated, and evaluated for risk of bias using the Nutrition Evidence Library Bias Assessment Tool. Results: Of 18793 references screened, 13 studies met eligibility criteria and were included in the review. Eight studies reported on diet and seven studies reported on activity behaviour outcomes (three on physical activity, three on sedentary behaviour, and one on sleep). These studies included results on 89 tested childcare:outcome associations. Of 63 associations testing diet outcomes, 37 (59%) were null, and the remainder showed inconsistent patterns. There was an indication of a potential benefit of Head Start providers (vs other care, including parental) on dietary behaviours. Of 26 associations testing activity behaviour outcomes, 22 (85%) were null, and the remainder were inconsistent. Most studies (92%) did not use (or did not report using) valid and reliable outcome measures, and outcome assessors were not blinded (or it was unclear if they were blinded) to children's exposure status (77%). Conclusions: The scarce available literature indicates little and mixed evidence of a longitudinal association between exposure to non-parental childcare before age six years and diet or activity behaviours. This reflects a paucity of research, rather than clear evidence of no effect. There is an urgent need for studies investigating the longitudinal associations of non-parental childcare on diet and activity behaviours to assess potential lasting effects and mechanisms. Studies should assess whether and how associations vary by provider and child sub-groups, as well as differences by intensity and duration of care.","Costa, S.; Benjamin Neelon, S.; Winpenny, E.; Phillips, V.; Adams, J.",20190823,"Public And Global Health","10.1101/19005413",1,"Silvia Costa","Loughborough University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005413v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005413v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"Not applicable - systematic review"
304,"Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of the Associations Between Body Mass Index, Prostate Cancer, Advanced Prostate Cancer and Prostate Specific Antigen","Purpose The relationship between body-mass index (BMI) and prostate cancer remains unclear. However, there is an inverse association between BMI and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), used for prostate cancer screening. We conducted this review to estimate the associations between BMI and (1) prostate cancer, (2) advanced prostate cancer, and (3) PSA. Methods We searched PubMed and Embase for studies until 02 October 2017 and obtained individual participant data from four studies. In total, 78 studies were identified for the association between BMI and prostate cancer, 21 for BMI and advanced prostate cancer, and 35 for BMI and PSA. We performed random-effects meta-analysis of linear associations of log PSA and prostate cancer with BMI and, to examine potential non-linearity, of associations between categories of BMI and each outcome. Results In the meta-analyses with continuous BMI, a 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI was associated with a percentage change in PSA of -5.88% (95% CI -6.87% to -4.87%). Using BMI categories, compared to normal weight men the PSA levels of overweight men were 3.43% lower (95% CI -5.57% to -1.23%), and obese men were 12.9% lower (95% CI -15.2% to -10.7%). Prostate cancer and advanced prostate cancer analyses showed little or no evidence associations. Conclusion There is little or no evidence of an association between BMI and risk of prostate cancer or advanced prostate cancer, and strong evidence of an inverse and non-linear association between BMI and PSA. The association between BMI and prostate cancer is likely biased if missed diagnoses are not considered.","Harrison, S.; Tilling, K.; Turner, E. L.; Martin, R. M.; Lennon, R. J.; Lane, J.

Giving immediate help for an injured child is a crucial step for saving the child from further disability and/or death. This study aimed to assess the determinant factors of first aid knowledge and basic practice among elementary school teachers in Debre Tabor, Ethiopia. Method: Institution based cross-sectional study was employed in Debre Tabor City. Single population proportion formula was used for sample size calculation and a total of 216 elementary school teachers were included in study. Simple random sampling technique with proportional allocation was applied for selections of the study participant. Data entry was done by Epi data version 3.1 and the data was exported to SPSS version 21 for analysis. Binary and multivariable logistic regression analysis were performed to identify determinants of knowledge on first aid. Crude and adjusted odds ratios were used to determine the significance and strength of association at 95% confidence interval. Result: Our study revealed that 45.8% of the subjects were knowledgeable on first aid. More than 75% of study participant reported that they have encountered a child who need first aid. Among this 64% of them provide first aid. The multivariable analysis revealed that service year (AOR=3.51, 95%CI: (1.06, 11.59)), educational status (AOR=12.15, 95%CI: (3.17, 46.67)), previous first aid training (AOR=0.43, 95%CI: (0.21, 0.87)) and information about first aid (AOR=0.12, 95%CI ;( 0.03, 0.48)) were found to be significantly associated with having knowledge on first aid. Conclusion: School teachers have low knowledge on first aid. Educational status, service year, previous first aid training and information on first aid were the predictor of first aid knowledge. Introducing essential first aid training in the curriculum during teachers training shall be considered.","Taklual, W.; Mekie, M.; Yenew, C.",20190905,"Pediatrics","10.1101/19005439",1,"Wubet Taklual","Debre Tabor University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005439v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005439v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"The datasets used in this study is available from the corresponding author can be accessible through reasonable request."

Materials and Methods: We used a large-scale Ohio vital statistic dataset from the Ohio Department of Health (ODH) and U.S. Census data from 2010-2016. We surveyed population differences with demographic profiling and use of relative proportions, conducted spatiotemporal pattern analysis with spatial autocorrelation via Moran statistics at the census tract level, and performed comorbidity analysis using frequent itemset mining and association rule mining. Results: Our analyses found higher rates of opioid-related death in people aged 25-54, whites, and males. We also found that opioid-related deaths in Ohio became more spatially concentrated during 2010-2016, and tended to be most clustered around Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati. Drug abuse, anxiety and cardiovascular disease were found to predict opioid-related death. Discussion: Comprehensive data-driven spatiotemporal analysis of opioid-related deaths provides essential identification of demographic, geographic and health factors related to opioid abuse. Future research should access personal health information for more detailed comorbidity analysis, as well as expand spatiotemporal models for real-time use. Conclusion: Computational analyses revealed demographic differences in opioid poisoning, changing regional patterns of opioid-related deaths, and health conditions co-occurring with opioid overdose for Ohio from 2010-2016, providing essential knowledge for both government officials and caregivers to establish policies and strategies to best combat the opioid epidemic.","Park, C.; Clemenceau, J.

Characteristics of acute illnesses during the first 4 years of life were recorded, including fever, vomiting, diarrhea, ED visits, hospitalizations, abnormal electrolytes, and stress-dose hydrocortisone usage. Results: CAH youth had more frequent illnesses requiring stress-dosing when they were younger than 2 years old [4.0 (1.0-6.0)] compared to when they were 2-4 years old [3.0 (1.0-4.0), P < 0.05], with the most illnesses during their first year of life. As well, CAH infants and toddlers had more hospitalizations younger than 2 years old compared to 2-4 years old (36 vs 2). 25% (3/12) of CAH youth with abnormal electrolytes in the ED did not receive any stress-dosing (oral/IM) prior to the ED, and only 25% (3/12) had received intramuscular hydrocortisone at home. CAH youth had more frequent ED visits (7.4 times as many) and hospitalizations (38 to 0) compared to controls. Conclusions: Very young children with classical CAH are at high risk for acute illness and hospitalizations during their first 2 years of life, and do not receive adequate stress-dosing prior to the ED despite appropriate education. Our findings underscore the need for earlier recognition of acute illness in this vulnerable population and improved education regarding administration of stress-dose hydrocortisone to prevent morbidity.","Tseng, T.; Seagroves, A.; Koppin, C.

335,"Influenza-associated mortality for different causes of death during the 2010-2011 through the 2014-2015 influenza seasons in Russia","Background: There is limited information on the volume of influenza-associated mortality in Russia. Methods: Using previously developed methodology (Goldstein et al., Epidemiology 2012), we regressed the monthly rates of mortality for respiratory causes, circulatory causes, and for certain infectious and parasitic diseases (available from the Russian Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat)) linearly against the monthly proxies for the incidence of influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B (obtained using data from the Smorodintsev Research Institute of Influenza (RII) on levels of ILI/ARI consultations and the percent of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B), adjusting for the baseline rates of mortality not associated with influenza circulation and temporal trends. Results: For the 2010/11 through the 2014/15 seasons, influenza circulation was associated with an average annual 11106 (95% CI (4321,17892)) deaths for circulatory causes, 4552 (3744,5360) deaths for respiratory causes, and 343 (63,624) deaths for certain infectious and parasitic diseases, with influenza A/H3N2 being responsible for the majority of influenza-associated respiratory deaths and influenza B making a substantial contribution to influenza-associated mortality for circulatory causes. Conclusions: Influenza circulation is associated with a substantial mortality burden in Russia, particularly for circulatory deaths. Those results support the potential utility of influenza vaccination (with the role played by influenza B in circulatory mortality pointing to the benefit of quadrivalent influenza vaccines), as well as of administration of antiviral drugs for high-risk individuals during periods of active influenza circulation.","Goldstein, E.",20190914,"Epidemiology","10.1101/19005470",2,"Edward Goldstein","Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005470v2?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005470v2.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"This paper is based on aggregate, publicly available data that can be accessed through links in refs. 15,16,17."
294,"Modified Long-Axis In-Plane Ultrasound Versus Short-Axis Out-of-Plane Ultrasound For Radial Arterial Cannulation:A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial","BACKGROUND Given a low first-pass success rate of the conventional SAX (short-axis) or LAX (long-axis) approach, ultrasound-guided radial artery cannulation in adults with radial artery diameter less than 2.2 mm may be still challenging. OBJECTIVE To assess the efficacy of modified long-axis in-plane(M-LAIP) versus short-axis out-of-plane (SAOP) or conventional palpation(C-P) approaches for ultrasound-guided radial artery cannulation. DESIGN A prospective, randomized and controlled trial. SETTING Operating room in a tertiary university hospital, from 1 July 2018 to 24 November 2018. PATIENTS A total of 201 patients (age 18 to 85 years, the diameter of the radial artery less 2.2 mm) were included. Patients with history of forearm surgery, ulnar artery occlusion, abnormal Allen test, etc, were excluded from this study. INTERVENTIONS All patients were randomized 1:1:1 to M-LAIP, SAOP or C-P. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the cannulation success rate. Secondary outcomes included first location time and cannulation time, number of attempts. RESULTS The cannulation success rate was significantly higher in the M-LAIP group than in the SAOP group or C-P group (first success rate: 80.3% vs 53.8% or 33.8%; p =0.000; total success rate: 93.9% vs 78.5% or 50.8%; p =0.000). First location time (s) was significantly longer in the M-LAIP group compared with the SAOP group (31(28-35[12-44]) vs 15(14-17[10-21]); p =0.000) and the C-P group (31(28-35[12-44]) vs 12(8-13.5 [6-37]); p =0.000). However, the time of cannulation in the M-LAIP group (29(24-45[16-313])) was significantly shorter than that in the SAOP group (45(28.5-135.5[14-346]), p =0.002) and in the C-P group(138(27-308[12-363]), p =0.000). The number of attempts decreased in the M-LAIP group compared with SAOP or C-P group. CONCLUSION The M-LAIP procedure for ultrasound-guided radial artery cannulation can offer a higher success rate of the first-attempt and total cannulation, fewer attempts and less time of cannulation.","Wang, J.; Zhang, L.; Lai, Z.; Huang, Q.; Wu, G.; Lin, L.; Liu, J.; Weng, X.",20190904,"Anesthesia","10.1101/19005496",1,"Liangcheng Zhang","Department of Anesthesiology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, No.29 Xin-Quan Road, Fuzhou, 350001, China.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005496v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005496v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"All data can be searched on Resman clinical trial public manage web."
291,"Impact of spectrograms on the classification of wheezes and crackles in an educational setting. An interrater study.","Background: Chest auscultation is a widely used method in the diagnosis of lung diseases. However, the interpretation of lung sounds is a subjective task and disagreements arise. New technological developments like the use of visual representation of sounds through spectrograms could improve the agreement when classifying lung sounds, but this is not yet known. Aims: To test if the use of spectrograms improves the agreement when classifying wheezes and crackles. Methods: We used 30 lung sounds recordings. The sample contained 15 normal recordings and 15 with wheezes or crackles. We produced spectrograms of the recordings. Twenty-three third to fifth-year medical students at UiT the Arctic University of Norway classified the recordings using an online questionnaire. We first showed the students examples of how wheezes and crackles looked in the spectrogram. Then, we played the recordings in a random order two times, first without the spectrogram, then with live spectrograms displayed. We asked them to classify the sounds for the presence of wheezes and crackles. We calculated kappa values for the agreement between each student and the expert classification with and without display of spectrograms and tested for significant improvement. We also calculated Fleiss kappa for the 23 observers with and without the spectrogram. Results: When classifying wheezes 13/23 (1 with p<.05) students had a positive change in k, and 16/23 (2 with p<.05). All the statistically significant changes were in the direction of improved kappa values (.52 - .75). Fleiss kappa values were k=.51 and k=.56 (p=.63) for wheezes without and with spectrograms. For crackles, these values were k=.22 and k=.40 (p[&le;]0.01) in the same order. Conclusions: The use of spectrograms had a positive impact on the inter-rater agreement and the agreement with experts. We observed a higher improvement in the classification of crackles compared to wheezes.","Aviles Solis, J.

292,"High occurrence of transportation and logistics occupations among vascular dementia patients: an observational study","Background Growing evidence suggests a role of occupation in the emergence and manifestation of dementia. Occupations are often defined by complexity level, although working environments and activities differ in several other important ways. We aimed to capture the multi-faceted nature of occupation through its measurement as a qualitative (instead of a quantitative) variable and explored its relationship with different types of dementia. Methods We collected occupational information of 2121 dementia patients with various suspected etiologies from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (age M=67, SD=8; 57% male; MMSE M=21, SD=5). Our final sample included individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia (n=1467), frontotemporal dementia (n=281), vascular dementia (n=98), Lewy body disease (n=174), and progressive supranuclear palsy/corticobasal degeneration (n=101). Within the AD group, we used neuropsychological data to further characterize patients by clinical phenotypes. All participants were categorized into 1 of 11 occupational classes, across which we evaluated the distribution of dementia (sub)types with Chi2 analyses. We gained further insight into occupation-dementia relationships through post hoc logistic regressions that included various demographic and health characteristics as explanatory variables. Results There were significant differences in the distribution of dementia types across occupation groups (Chi2=85.87, p<.001). Vascular dementia was relatively common in the Transportation/Logistics sector, and higher vascular risk factors partly explained this relationship. AD occurred less in Transportation/Logistics and more in Health Care/Welfare occupations, which related to a higher/lower percentage of males. We found no relationships between occupational classes and clinical phenotypes of AD (Chi2=53.65, n.s.). Conclusions Relationships between occupation and dementia seem to exist beyond the complexity level, which offers new opportunities for disease prevention and improvement of occupational health policy.","Van Loenhoud, A.

524,"Community gender systems and daughter's risk of female genital mutilation/cutting: New theory and application to Egypt","We proposed and tested a feminist social ecological theory about daughters' experience of female genital mutilation/cutting (FGMC) in Egypt, where over 90% of women ages 15 to 49 are cut. FGMC has potential adverse effects on demographic and health outcomes and has been defined as a human rights violation. Contextual factors are important determinants of FGMC, but an integrated theory is lacking, and quantitative multilevel research is limited. We theorized that more favorable community level gender systems, including gender norms opposing FGMC and expanded opportunities for women outside of the family, would be associated with a daughter's lower risk of FGMC and would strengthen the negative association of a mother's opposition to FGMC with her daughter's risk of cutting. Using a national sample of 14,171 mother/daughter dyads from the 2014 Egypt Demographic and Health Survey, we estimated multilevel discrete time hazard models to test these relationships. Community gender norms opposing FGMC had significant direct, negative associations with the hazard that a daughter was cut, but women's opportunities outside the family did not. Maternal opposition to FGMC was negatively associated with cutting a daughter, and these associations were stronger where community opposition to FGMC and opportunities for women were greater. Results provided good support for a gender systems theory of the multilevel influences on FGMC. Integrated, multilevel interventions that address gender norms about FGMC and opportunities for women in the community, as well as beliefs about the practice among the mothers of at-risk daughters may be needed for sustainable declines in the practice.","Yount, K.

383,"Rate and predictors of Treatment Failure among pediatric population taking Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy in Ethiopia","Background: Though the unprecedented global effort at scaling up universal access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) has decreased the progression of HIV, treatment failure (TF) among pediatric patients receiving ART against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is becoming a global public health concern which may impact on treatment outcome. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the rate and predictors of treatment failure (TF) among HIV-infected pediatric patients taking ART in Ethiopia. Methods: A prospective and retrospective follow-up study was conducted from March 2016 to 2017. Retrospective clinical and laboratory data were captured from patients medical record. Socio-demographics and explanatory variables of participants were collected using pre-tested structured questionnaire and study participants were followed for three to six month after baseline viral load has been done to classify virologic failure (VF). TF was ascertained from population who virally failed with the denominator of population taking ART. Chi-square test and multiple logistic regressions were conducted to assess predictors TF. Statistical significance was set at P-value less than 0.05. Results: A total of 554 pediatrics patients taking ART from 40 selected health facilities were included in the study. Viral load suppression (VLS) (VL<1000 copies/ml) among pediatric population taking ART in Ethiopia were found to be 344 (62.1%). From those who was not virally suppressed at baseline of the study 210 (37.9%), 99 (51.6%) were re-suppressed after three to six month of enhanced adherence and counseling, leading the overall virologic failure (VF) among pediatric population taking ART in Ethiopia to be 93 (17.3%). The mean CD4 count was improved from 490 cells/ml at ART initiation to 921 cells/ml after 80 months of ART exposure. Moreover, the clinical outcome was improved from 42% to 89% at ART initiation and after 80 month of ART experience. CD4 count, clinical stage, Hemoglobin and weight were found to be predictors of VF. Moreover; family HIV and disclosure status, duration on ART, age, being orphan, stigma and medication adherence have significant association with VF. Conclusions: The low level of VLS (62.1%) and the high level of VF (18.3%) could explain the challenge on the national ART program among pediatric population. The significant improvement on immunologic and clinical outcome could indicate the success of ART on treatment outcome among pediatric population. CD4 count, clinical stage, Hemoglobin and weight could be good predictors of TF among pediatric population. Improving disclosure status, stigma and medication adherence could improve the treatment outcome of pediatric population taking ART in Ethiopia.","Misganie, Y.

301,"Novel delivery of cellular therapy to reduce ischaemia reperfusion injury in kidney transplantation","Abstract: Ex-vivo normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) of donor kidneys prior to transplantation provides a platform for direct delivery of cellular therapeutics to optimise organ quality prior to transplantation. Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells (MAPC(R)) possess potent immunomodulatory properties which could prove beneficial in minimising subsequent ischaemia reperfusion injury. We investigated the potential reconditioning capability of MAPC cells in kidney NMP. Methods: Pairs (5) of human kidneys from the same donor were simultaneously perfused for 7 hours. The right or left kidney was randomly allocated to receive MAPC treatment. Serial samples of perfusate, urine and tissue biopsies were taken for comparison with the control paired kidney. Results: MAPC-treated kidneys demonstrated improved urine output (p<0.01), decreased expression of the kidney injury biomarker NGAL (p<0.01), improved microvascular perfusion on contrast enhanced ultrasound (cortex p<0.05, medulla p<0.01), downregulation of IL-1{beta} (p<0.05) and upregulation of IL-10 (p<0.05) and Indolamine-2, 3-dioxygenase (p<0.05). A mouse model of intraperitoneal chemotaxis demonstrated decreased neutrophil recruitment when stimulated with perfusate from MAPC-treated kidneys (p<0.01). Immunofluorescence revealed pre-labelled MAPC cells home to the perivascular space in the kidneys during NMP. MAPC therapy was not associated with detrimental physiological or embolic events. Conclusion: We report the first successful delivery of cellular therapy to a kidney during NMP. Kidneys treated with MAPC cells demonstrate improvement in clinically relevant functional parameters and injury biomarkers. This novel method of cell therapy delivery provides an exciting opportunity to recondition organs prior to clinical transplantation.","Thompson, E. R.; Bates, L.; Ibrahim, I.

303,"Changes in association between school meals and children's dietary quality during implementation of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010","The Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 raised standards for foods sold in US schools. The aims of this paper are to estimate policy effects on dietary quality of US school-aged children, and determine if effects differed by free/reduced-price meal eligibility or age group. We estimated within-child associations between school food consumption and dietary quality (using Health Eating Index - 2010), by comparing two 24-hour dietary recalls per child from the 2007-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We used inverse probability weighting to account for population changes during this period. We scaled changes of association (implementation period versus pre-passage) by proportion of energy from school foods. School foods were 10% of annual calories, 33% on days when children ate school foods. Each percentage point of energy from school foods was associated with 0.08 more Healthy Eating Index points during implementation than pre-passage. The scaled estimated effect of policy implementation on annual dietary quality is 0.84 Healthy Eating Index points, 2.8 points on days when children eat school foods. Estimated effects were slightly greater for children eligible for free/reduced-price meals and high school-aged children, though confidence intervals include zero. The results indicate that targeted policies can improve children's dietary quality.","Berger, A. T.; Widome, R.; Erickson, D. J.; Laska, M. N.; Harnack, L.

412,"Natural Language Processing for Mimicking Clinical Trial Recruitment in Critical Care: A Semi-automated Simulation Based on the LeoPARDS Trial","Clinical trials often fail on recruiting an adequate number of appropriate patients. Identifying eligible trial participants is a resource-intensive task when relying on manual review of clinical notes, particularly in critical care settings where the time window is short. Automated review of electronic health records has been explored as a way of identifying trial participants, but much of the information is in unstructured free text rather than a computable form. We developed an electronic health record pipeline that combines structured electronic health record data with free text in order to simulate recruitment into the LeoPARDS trial. We applied an algorithm to identify eligible patients using a moving 1-hour time window, and compared the set of patients identified by our approach with those actually screened and recruited for the trial. We manually reviewed clinical records for a random sample of additional patients identified by the algorithm but not identified for screening in the original trial. Our approach identified 308 patients, of whom 208 were screened in the actual trial. We identified all 40 patients with CCHIC data available who were actually recruited to LeoPARDS in our centre. The algorithm identified 96 patients on the same day as manual screening and 62 patients one or two days earlier. Analysis of electronic health records incorporating natural language processing tools could effectively replicate recruitment in a critical care trial, and identify some eligible patients at an earlier stage. If implemented in real-time this could improve the efficiency of clinical trial recruitment.","Tissot, H.; Shah, A.; Agbakoba, R.; Folarin, A.; Romao, L.; Brealey, D.; Harris, S.; Roguski, L.; Dobson, R.; Asselbergs, F.",20190926,"Health Informatics","10.1101/19005603",2,"Hegler Tissot","University College London","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005603v2?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005603v2.full.pdf","cc_no","10.1109/JBHI.2020.2977925","Patient data analysed for this project was extracted from the Critical Care Health Informatics Collaboration research database, which has had National Research Ethics Service approval (14/LO/1031).

315,"A deep learning approach with event-related spectral EEG data in attentional deficit hyperactivity disorder","Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 5% of the pediatric and adult population worldwide. The diagnosis remains essentially clinical, based on history and exam, with no available biomarkers. In this paper, we describe a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for ADHD classification derived from the time-frequency decomposition of electroencephalography data (EEG), particularly of event-related potentials (ERP) during the Flanker Task collected from 20 ADHD adult patients and 20 healthy controls (HC). The model reaches a classification accuracy of 88%, superior to resting state EEG spectrograms and with the key advantage, compared with other machine learning approaches, of avoiding the need for manual selection of EEG spectral or channel features. Finally, through the use of feature visualization techniques, we show that the main features exciting the DCNN nodes are a decreased power in the alpha band and an increased power in the delta-theta band around 100ms for ADHD patients compared to HC, suggestive of attentional and inhibition deficits, which have been previously suggested as pathophyisiological signatures of ADHD. While confirmation with larger clinical samples is necessary, these results highlight the potential of this methodology to develop CNS biomarkers of practical clinical utility.","Dubreuil-Vall, L.; Ruffini, G.; Camprodon, J.",20190911,"Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology","10.1101/19005611",1,"Laura Dubreuil-Vall","Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005611v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005611v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"The datasets generated and analyzed during the current study are available from the senior author (JAC) on reasonable request."
310,"The purine pathway in liver tissue biopsies from donors for transplantation is associated to immediate graft function and survival","Background & Aims: The current shortage of livers for transplantation has increased the use of organs sourced from donation after circulatory death (DCD). These organs are prone to higher incidence of graft failure, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we aimed to find biomarkers of liver function before transplantation to better inform clinical evaluation. Methods: Matched pre- and post-transplant liver biopsies from DCD (n=24) and donation after brain death (DBD, n=70) were collected. Liver biopsies were analysed using mass spectroscopy molecular phenotyping. First, a discrimination analysis DCD vs DBD was used to parse metabolites associated to DCD. Then a data-driven approach was used to predict Immediate Graft Function (IGF). The metabolites were tested in models to predict survival. Results: Five metabolites in the purine pathway were selected and investigated. The ratios of: adenine monophosphate (AMP), adenine, adenosine and hypoxanthine to urate, differed between DBD and DCD biopsies at pre- transplantation stage (q<0.05). The ratios of AMP and adenine to urate also differed in biopsies from recipients undergoing IGF (q<0.05). Using random forest a panel composed by alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and AMP, adenine, hypoxanthine ratio to urate predicted IGF with AUC 0.84 (95% CI [0.71, 0.97]). In comparison AUC 0.71 (95%CI [0.52, 0.90]) was achieved by clinical measures. Survival analysis revealed that the metabolite classifier could stratify 6-year survival outcomes (p = 0.0073) while clinical data and donor class could not. Conclusions: At liver pre-transplantation stage, a panel composed of purine metabolites and ALT in tissue could improve prediction of IGF and survival.","Xu, J.; Hassan-Ally, M.; Casas-Ferreira, A.

320,"Exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances in a cohort of women firefighters and office workers in San Francisco","Background: Studies in male firefighters have demonstrated increased exposures to carcinogenic compounds and increased rates of certain cancers compared to the general population. Many chemicals related to these occupational exposures have been associated with breast tumor development in animal and human studies, yet, there have been no studies on women firefighters due to their low numbers in most fire departments. To address this data gap, the Women Firefighters Biomonitoring Collaborative (WFBC) created a biological sample archive and analyzed levels of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) among women firefighters and office workers in San Francisco. Methods: Active duty women firefighters (n=86) and office workers (n=84) were recruited from the San Francisco Fire Department and the City and County of San Francisco, respectively. Serum samples were collected and analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS) to measure and compare PFAS levels between firefighters and office workers. For PFAS congeners detected in at least 70% of our study population, we examined differences in serum PFAS levels controlling for dietary, demographic and other confounders. Among firefighters, we assessed associations between occupational activities and PFAS levels. Results: Eight of 12 PFAS congeners were detected at levels above the limit of detection and seven were detected in at least 70% of the study population. Four PFAS were detected in all study participants (PFNA, PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS). In regression models comparing PFAS levels by occupation and adjusting for potential confounders, firefighters had higher geometric mean (GM) concentrations of PFAS compared to office workers: 2.39 (95%CI = 1.64,3.48), 2.32 (95% CI = 1.17,4.62) and 1.26 (95% CI = 0.99, 1.59) times higher for PFHxS, PFUnDA and PFNA, respectively. In analyses limited to firefighters, PFAS levels varied by assigned position in the fire department. Firefighters and officers had higher PFNA, PFOA, PFDA, and PFUnDA compared to drivers. Additionally, firefighters who reported having used firefighting foam had higher concentrations of PFOA compared firefighters who reported never having used foam. Conclusion: Our study found ubiquitous exposures to PFAS among WFBC participants, with women firefighters exposed to higher levels of some PFAS compared to office workers, suggesting that some of these exposures may be occupationally related.","Trowbridge, J.

365,"Symbolic transfer entropy reveals the age structure of pandemic influenza transmission from high-volume influenza-like illness data","Existing methods to infer the relative roles of age groups in epidemic transmission can normally only accommodate a few age classes, and/or require data that are highly specific for the disease being studied. Here, symbolic transfer entropy (STE), a measure developed to identify asymmetric transfer of information between stochastic processes, is presented as a way to determine which age groups drive an epidemic. STE provides a ranking of which age groups dominate transmission, rather than a reconstruction of the explicit between-age-group transmission matrix. Using simulations, we establish that STE can identify which age groups dominate transmission, even when there are differences in reporting rates between age groups and even if the data is noisy. Then, the pairwise STE is calculated between time series of influenza-like illness for 12 age groups in 884 US cities during the autumn of 2009. Elevated STE from 5-19 year-olds indicates that school-aged children were the most important transmitters of infection during the autumn wave of the 2009 pandemic in the US. The results may be partially confounded by higher rates of physician-seeking behaviour in children compared to adults, but it is unlikely that differences in reporting rates can explain the observed differences in STE.","Kissler, S.

340,"Checklists to Detect Potential Predatory Biomedical Journals: A Systematic Review","Background: We believe there is a large number of checklists to help authors detect predatory journals. It is uncertain whether these checklists contain similar content. Purpose: Perform a systematic review to identify checklists to detect potential predatory journals and to examine their content and measurement properties. Data Sources: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, ERIC, Web of Science and Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts (January 2012 to November 2018), university library websites (January 2019), YouTube (January 2019). Study Selection: Original checklists used to detect potential predatory journals published in English, French or Portuguese, with instructions in point form, bullet form, tabular format or listed items, not including lists or guidance on recognizing ""legitimate"" or ""trustworthy"" journals. Data Extraction: Pairs of reviewers independently extracted study data and assessed checklist quality and a third reviewer resolved conflicts. Data Synthesis: Of 1528 records screened, 93 met our inclusion criteria. The majority of included checklists were in English (n = 90, 97%), could be completed in fewer than five minutes (n = 68, 73%), had an average of 11 items, which were not weighted (n = 91, 98%), did not include qualitative guidance (n = 78, 84%) or quantitative guidance (n = 91, 98%), were not evidence-based (n = 90, 97%) and covered a mean of four (of six) thematic categories. Only three met our criteria for being evidence-based. Limitations: Limited languages and years of publication, searching other media. Conclusions: There is a plethora of published checklists that may overwhelm authors looking to efficiently guard against publishing in predatory journals. The similarity in checklists could lead to the creation of evidence-based tools serving authors from all disciplines.","Cukier, S.; Helal, L.; Rice, D.

909,"Postgraduate education among family and community physicians in Brazil: the Trajetorias MFC project","Neither primary health care or family and community medicine are recognized as knowledge areas in Brazil, for the purpose of postgraduate education (master's, Ph.D.) or research. Our objective was to describe the postgraduate education trajectories of family and community physicians in Brazil. In this observational, exploratory study, we used data from SBMFC and SisCNRM to compile the list of physicians and community physicians, and then downloaded their curricula vitae from the Lattes Platform, verifying all data for consistency. A master's degree was held by one in eight, and a Ph.D., by one in forty; most degrees were in collective health. Women (versus men) were less likely to hold master's degrees, and even less likely to hold Ph.D. degrees. Professional (versus academic) master's degrees and those in other areas (versus in medicine or collective health) were also associated with lower probability of obtaining a Ph.D. degree. Certified specialists (versus those with a medical residency) with a postgraduate degree were more likely to have earned it before becoming family and community physicians. We suggest that researchers in public health critically examine the relative benefits of different postgraduate trajectories for the professional performance of family and community physicians.","Fontenelle, L.

322,"Dyspareunia in their own words: A comprehensive qualitative description of endometriosis-associated sexual pain","Background: Dyspareunia is a classic symptom of endometriosis but is neglected in research and clinical contexts. This study explored the experience of this endometriosis-associated sexual pain. Methods: This was a qualitative descriptive study that included people who had experienced endometriosis-associated dyspareunia alone or with a partner. Data collection involved semi-structured interviews with a female researcher that began with an open-ended question about dyspareunia and included interview prompts related to the nature of sexual pain. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed for themes. Results: 17 participants completed interviews. The mean participant age was 33.3 (SD=7.2) and most participants identified as white (82%), were college-educated (71%), identified as heterosexual (65%), and were partnered (59%). Location, onset, and character emerged as important, interrelated features of endometriosis-associated dyspareunia, as did severity and impact. Dyspareunia occurred at the vaginal opening (n=7) and in the abdomen/pelvis (n=13). Pain at the vaginal opening began with initial penetration and had pulling, burning and stinging qualities. Pain in the pelvis was typically experienced with deep penetration or in certain position and was described as sharp, stabbing and/or cramping. Dyspareunia ranged from mild to severe, and for some participants had a marked psychosocial impact. Conclusions: Dyspareunia is a heterogeneous symptom of endometriosis that ranges in severity and impact. Disaggregating dyspareunia into superficial and deep types may better reflect the etiologies of this pain, thereby improving outcome measurement in intervention studies and clinical care.","Wahl, K.; Imtiaz, S.; Smith, K.

318,"Cohort Profile: the Oxford Parkinson's Disease Centre Discovery Cohort Magnetic Resonance Imaging sub-study (OPDC-MRI)","Purpose: The Oxford Parkinson's Disease Centre (OPDC) Discovery Cohort magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sub-study (OPDC-MRI) collects high quality multimodal brain MRI together with deep longitudinal clinical phenotyping in patients with Parkinson's, at-risk individuals and healthy elderly participants. The primary aim is to detect pathological changes in brain structure and function, and develop, together with the clinical data, biomarkers to stratify, predict and chart progression in early-stage Parkinson's and at-risk individuals. Participants: Participants are recruited from the OPDC Discovery Cohort, a prospective, longitudinal study. Baseline MRI data is currently available for 290 participants: 119 patients with early idiopathic Parkinson's, 15 Parkinson's patients with pathogenic mutations of the LRRK2 or GBA genes, 68 healthy controls and 87 individuals at risk of Parkinson's (asymptomatic carriers of GBA mutation and patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder - RBD). Findings to date: Differences in brain structure in early Parkinson's were found to be subtle, with small changes in the shape of the globus pallidus and evidence of alterations in microstructural integrity in the prefrontal cortex that correlated with performance on executive function tests. Brain function, as assayed with resting fMRI yielded more substantial differences, with basal ganglia connectivity reduced in early Parkinson's, and RBD, but not Alzheimer's, suggesting that the effect is pathology specific. Imaging of the substantia nigra with the more recent adoption of sequences sensitive to iron and neuromelanin content shows promising results in identifying early signs of Parkinsonian disease. Future plans: Ongoing studies include the integration of multimodal MRI measures to improve discrimination power. Follow-up clinical data are now accumulating and will allow us to correlate baseline imaging measures to clinical disease progression. Follow-up MRI scanning started in 2015 and is currently ongoing, providing the opportunity for future longitudinal imaging analyses with parallel clinical phenotyping.","Griffanti, L.; Klein, J.

Here we present the results of a spatial analysis of CNS infections in Lao PDR (2003 - 2011). Hospitalizations for suspected CNS infection were recorded at Mahosot Hospital in Vientiane and tests for a large panel of pathogens were performed. All home villages were geocoded using patient records and official Lao PDR census data. The spatial distributions of CNS infections were analyzed by major diagnoses. Summary statistics and logistic regressions were used to test for associations between geographic, environmental, and demographic variables and diagnoses. Out of 1,065 patients, 450 (42%) were assigned a confirmed diagnosis. Japanese encephalitis virus ((JEV); n=94) and Cryptococcus spp. (n=70) were the most common infections. Patients undergoing diagnostic LP for suspected CNS infections lived closer to major roads than would be expected by chance alone. JEV was the most spatially dispersed, peaked in the rainy season and was most common among children. JEV patients came from villages that had higher surface flooding during the same month as admission and, in comparison to the home villages of other patients, came from villages at higher elevation. Cryptococcus spp. infections clustered near Vientiane and among adults. Geographic and financial access to healthcare may explain the close proximity of these patients to major roads and also suggest that these hospital data vastly underestimate the true community burden of CNS infections. As Lao PDR is undergoing major developmental and environmental changes, the space-time distributions of the causative agents of CNS infection will also likely change. There is a major need for increased diagnostic abilities; increased access to healthcare, especially for rural populations; and for increased surveillance throughout the nation.","Rattanavong, S.; Dubot-Peres, A.; Mayxay, M.; Vongsouvath, M.; Lee, S.

358,"Physical activity and risk of breast and endometrial cancers: a Mendelian randomization study","Importance: The causality of the association between physical activity and risk of breast and endometrial cancers is uncertain because available evidence is based exclusively on observational studies, which are potentially susceptible to confounding and reverse causation. Objective: To investigate whether increased physical activity is causally associated with decreased risk of breast and endometrial cancers, using a two-sample Mendelian randomization study design. Design, Setting, and Participants: Genome-wide association studies of physical activity, breast cancer, and endometrial cancer, published up to April 31, 2019, were identified using PubMed and the GWAS catalog. Twelve single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) known at P<5x10-8 to be associated with accelerometer-assessed or self-reported physical activity served as instrumental variables. Genetic summary data from four large consortia provided SNP-outcome associations [Breast Cancer Association Consortium; Discovery, Biology and Risk of Inherited Variants in Breast Cancer Consortium; Endometrial Cancer Association Consortium]. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were risk of breast cancer and risk of endometrial cancer. Secondary outcomes were estrogen receptor positive (ER+) and ER- breast cancers. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) per mean acceleration in milli-gravities of accelerometer-assessed physical activity and per one standard deviation (1-SD) increase in metabolic-equivalent (MET)-minutes/week of self-reported moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were computed using the inverse variance weighted method. A series of sensitivity analyses addressed the potential impact of heterogeneity, pleiotropy, and outliers. Results: Summary data were available for 122,977 breast cancers and 12,270 endometrial cancers. Genetic predisposition to increased accelerometer-assessed physical activity was associated with lower risk of breast and endometrial cancers. The associations (ORs [95% CI] per 1-SD increase in mean acceleration) were 0.88 (0.85-0.91) for breast cancer and 0.90 (0.83-0.97) for endometrial cancer. In addition, genetic predisposition to increased accelerometer-assessed physical activity was associated with lower risk of ER+ breast cancer. We found no evidence for an association between genetic predisposition to self-reported physical activity and risk of total breast cancer, breast cancer subtypes, or endometrial cancer. Conclusion and Relevance: This first Mendelian randomization study shows that objectively-assessed physical activity plays a causal role in protecting against breast and endometrial cancers.","Baurecht, H.; Leitzmann, M.; O'mara, T.; Thompson, D.

Current estimates of MS burden in Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) are necessary for planning effective interventions. To estimate Prevalence, incidence, mortality, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs) and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in EMR by country age, and sex from 1990 to 2016. Methods: We estimated regional and country-specific prevalence, incidence, mortality, DALYs, YLLs, and YLDs for MS. DALYs were computed as the sum of YLDs and YLLs. Results: Total DALYs in EMR countries was 12,810 in 1990 for males and increased to 36,391 in 2016 and from 18,962 to 53,851 for females. Lowest DALYs in both sexes were observed in Somalia (248) while the highest were in Iran (26,394). YLDs in males increased from 6,511 in 1990 to 19,515 in 2016, and in females from 12,247 to 33,937. The highest age-standardized prevalence, incidence, YLDs and DALYs were in Iran (72.11, 2.49, 18.03, and 32.5, respectively).

306,"White adipose tissue inflammation is not attenuated by short-term calorie restriction in obese humans","Obesity is a growing global health problem due to its association with chronic low-grade inflammation contributing to metabolic complications. Multiple studies indicate that white adipose tissue (WAT) inflammation can drive the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, including altered levels of cells of the innate and adaptive immune system. However, the function and regulation of both innate and adaptive immune cells in human WAT under conditions of obesity and calorie restriction (CR) is not fully understood yet. Using a randomized interventional design, we investigated postmenopausal obese women who either underwent CR for three months followed by a 4 weeks phase of weight maintenance or had to maintain a stable weight over the whole study period. A comprehensive immune phenotyping protocol was conducted using validated multiparameter flow cytometry analysis in blood and subcutaneous WAT (SAT) (n=21). The T cell receptor repertoire was analyzed by next generation sequencing (n=20) and cytokine levels were determined in SAT (n=22). Metabolic parameters were determined by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and then correlated to immune cell subsets. We found that insulin resistance (IR) correlates significantly with a shift towards the memory T cell compartment in SAT. Among various T cell subsets, predominantly CD8+ effector memory T cells were associated with obesity-related IR. Interestingly, T cell receptor analysis revealed a diverse repertoire in SAT arguing against an antigen-driven intra-SAT expansion of effector memory T cells. Surprisingly, neither inflammatory cytokine levels nor leucocyte subpopulations were significantly altered upon CR. Our findings demonstrate the accumulation of effector memory T cells in obese SAT contributing to chronic inflammation. The long-standing effect of obesity-induced changes in SAT was demonstrated by preserved immune cell composition after short-term CR induced weight loss.","Sbierski-Kind, J.; Mai, K.; Kath, J.; Jurisch, A.; Streitz, M.; Kuchenbecker, L.; Juerchott, K.; Spranger, L.; Jumpertz Von Schwartzenberg, R.; Decker, A.-M.; Krueger, U.; Volk, H.-D.; Spranger, J.",20190909,"Endocrinology","10.1101/19005934",1,"Julia Sbierski-Kind","Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Corporate Member of Freie Universitaet Berlin, Humboldt-Universitaet zu Berlin","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005934v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19005934v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"The raw data supporting the conclusions of this manuscript will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation, to any qualified researcher"
385,"Excess Pneumonia Mortality During a Legionnaires' Disease Outbreak in Flint, Michigan","Introduction: From June 2014-October 2015, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) reported a Legionnaires' disease (LD) outbreak in Genesee County, Michigan, of which Flint is the county seat. MDHHS' final case count for the outbreak was 90 cases, including 10 deaths among Genesee County residents. As LD is not routinely tested for as a cause of community-acquired pneumonia, the size of the outbreak may have been underestimated. Specifically, some LD cases may have been classified as pneumonias of other or unexplained etiologies. Objective: To estimate excess pneumonia deaths in Genesee County during the 2014-15 LD outbreak and compare this with reported LD death tolls. Methods: We used data from the CDC WONDER database, which contains monthly county-level counts of death certificates, on all pneumonia deaths among residents of Genesee and a set of similar counties from 2011-2017. We calculated excess pneumonia deaths in Genesee during the period of the LD outbreak (May 2014-October 2015). We used data from the Genesee County Vital Records Division to map pneumonia deaths by census tract to assess geographic overlap with reported LD cases. Results: We estimated 70.0 excess pneumonia deaths (90% uncertainty interval (UI): 36 to 103) in Genesee County during the LD outbreak. This is substantially higher than the 10 LD deaths among Genesee County residents reported by MDHHS. Areas of high pneumonia mortality overlapped with those with high LD incidence and were primarily located in western Flint and northwestern non-Flint Genesee County. Conclusions: These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the LD outbreak was larger than reported. Earlier detection and response to this outbreak may have facilitated identification of these additional cases.","Binney, Z. O.; Nelson, K. N.; Chamberlain, A.

Methods: A total sample of 564 (190 female) participants between the ages of 7-15 (mean = 10.80, SD = 2.16), along with their parents/guardians, completed diagnostic interviews with clinicians, answered a myriad of self-report questionnaires, and underwent physical testing as part of the Healthy Brain Network protocol. Results: PIU was positively associated with depressive disorders (aOR = 2.34; CI: 1.18-4.56; p = .01), the combined subtype of ADHD (aOR = 1.79; CI: 1.08-2.98; p = .02), greater levels of impairment (Standardized Beta = 4.79; CI: 3.21-6.37; p < .01) and increased sleep disturbances (Standardized Beta = 3.01; CI: 0.58-5.45; p = .02), even when accounting for demographic covariates and psychiatric comorbidity.

321,"Absence of Testicular Adrenal Rest Tumors in Newborns, Infants, and Toddlers with Classical Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia","INTRODUCTION: Testicular adrenal rest tumors (TART) are a known consequence for males with classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. TART are associated with potential infertility in adults. However, little is known about TART in very young males with CAH. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the prevalence of TART in newborn, infant, and toddler males with classical CAH via scrotal ultrasound. METHODS: Males with CAH had scrotal ultrasounds during the first 4 years of life, evaluating testes for morphology, blood flow, and presence of TART. Newborn screen 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) and serum 17-OHP at the time of ultrasound were recorded. Bone ages were considered very advanced if [&ge;] 2SD above chronological age. RESULTS: Thirty-one ultrasounds in 16 males were performed. An initial ultrasound was obtained in four newborns at diagnosis (6.8 {+/-} 2.1 days), six infants (2.2 {+/-} 0.9 months), and six toddlers (2.4 {+/-} 0.9 years). Eleven males had at least one repeat ultrasound. A large proportion (11/16) were in poor hormonal control with an elevated 17-OHP (325 {+/-} 298 nmol/L). One infant was in very poor hormonal control (17-OHP 447 nmol/L) at initial ultrasound, and two toddlers had advanced bone ages (+3.2 and +4.5 SD) representing exposure to postnatal androgens. However, no TART were detected in any subjects. CONCLUSIONS: TART were not found in males up to 4 years of age with classical CAH despite settings with expected high ACTH drive. Further research into the occurrence of TART in CAH may elucidate factors which contribute to the detection and individual predisposition to TART.","Kim, M. S.; Koppin, C.

366,"Scaffolding the Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Brain Using Transcranial Direct Current and Random Noise Stimulation","Various methods have been attempted to effectively ameliorate psychiatric and neurological conditions in children and adults. One of the attractive ideas is to develop interventions to create a lasting, rather than only an immediate, effect. Neurostimulation has been shown to yield long-term effect when combined with cognitive training in healthy young adults. We examined whether such approach could benefit children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the most common neurodevelopmental disorder in childhood. We used a randomized double-blind active-controlled crossover study of 19 unmedicated children (aged 7-12 years old) with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, who received either transcranial direct current stimulation or random noise stimulation while completing five-day executive functions training, which includes working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibition tasks. Both stimulation protocols have previously shown potential for inducing lasting benefits in adults, while transcranial direct current stimulation was examined in multiple attention deficit hyperactivity disorder studies and has been highlighted as a promising method for treating neuropsychological deficits. For our primary outcome, transcranial random noise stimulation yielded a clinical improvement as indicated by the reduced attention deficit hyperactivity disorder rating scale score from baseline, and in comparison to the changes observed in transcranial direct current stimulation. Moreover, the effect of brain stimulation one week after completion of treatment yielded further improvement, suggesting a neuroplasticity-related effect. Finally, transcranial random noise stimulation improved working memory compared to transcranial direct current stimulation, and a larger transcranial random noise stimulation effect on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder rating scale was predicted for those patients who showed the greatest improvement in working memory. Our results provide a promising direction toward a novel intervention in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which is shown to have a lasting effect via the modulating of neuroplasticity, rather than a merely immediate effect as was shown for in previous medical interventions.","Berger, I.; Dakwar-Kawar, O.; Grossman, E.

498,"Assessing the impact of data aggregation in model predictions of HAT transmission and control activities","Since the turn of the century, the global community has made great progress towards the elimination of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). Elimination programs, primarily relying on screening and treatment campaigns, have also created a rich database of HAT epidemiology. Mathematical models calibrated with these data can help to fill remaining gaps in our understanding of HAT transmission dynamics, including key operational research questions such as whether integrating vector control with current intervention strategies is needed to achieve HAT elimination. Here we explore, via an ensemble of models and simulation studies, which aspects of the available data and level of data aggregation, such as separation by disease stage, would be most useful for better understanding transmission dynamics and improving model reliability in making future predictions of control and elimination strategies.","Castano, M.

314,"Associations between reasons for vaping and current vaping and smoking status: Evidence from a UK based cohort","Introduction Given the popularity of e-cigarettes, it is important to know who vapes, why, and whether different reasons for vaping are associated with vaping and smoking status. Methods In a UK cohort of young adults (23-26 years), we explored the characteristics of vapers and whether different reasons for vaping were associated with later vaping and smoking status. We used multinomial logistic regression to assess the association among ever smokers and vapers. Results Ever and never vapers differed in numerous demographic and behavioural characteristics. Vaping out of curiosity was associated with lower likelihood of being a current vaper (adjusted relative risk ratio [aRRR] = 0.26, 95% confidence interval [95%CI] = 0.12 to 0.57, p < 0.001) but a higher likelihood of being a neither user compared to a current smoker at 24 years (aRRR = 2.13, 95%CI = 1.44 to 3.17, p < 0.001). Vaping to quit smoking was associated with higher likelihood of being a dual user (aRRR = 3.21, 95%CI = 1.74 to 5.90, p < 0.001) or a current vaper (aRRR = 3.26, 95%CI = 1.62 to 6.54, p < 0.001) but a lower likelihood of being a neither user (aRRR = 0.53, 95%CI = 0.34 to 0.82, p = 0.004) compared to being a current smoker at 24. Conclusions Intention to quit smoking may be necessary for young people to effectively stop smoking using e-cigarettes.","Khouja, J. N.; Taylor, A. E.; Munafo, M.

684,"Time trends in socio-economic inequalities in HIV testing: insights from population-based surveys in 16 sub-Saharan African countries","Background Overall increase in the uptake of HIV testing in the past decades may hide discrepancies across socio-economic groups. We used population-based surveys conducted in sub-Saharan Africa to quantify socio-economic inequalities in recent HIV testing uptake, together with their trends over the two past decades. Methods We analyzed the data from Demographic and Health Surveys in sub-Saharan African countries where at least one survey was conducted before and after 2008. Country- and gender-specific proportions of recent (<12 month) HIV testing were assessed across wealth and education groups, and inequalities were quantified using the relative and slope indices of inequalities. Time trends in inequalities were assessed and results were pooled across countries using random-effect meta-analyses. Findings We analyzed data from 32 surveys conducted between 2003 and 2016 in 16 countries among 537,784 participants. In pre-2008 surveys, women reported higher HIV testing uptake than men in 8 out of 16 countries, and in 15 out of 16 countries in post-2008 surveys. After 2008, the wealthiest women were on average 2.77 (95% CI 1.42-5.40) times more likely to report recent testing than the poorest; and 3.55 (1.85-6.81) times in men. The averaged absolute difference in recent testing between the richest and poorest was 11.1 (4.6-17.5) percentage points in women and 15.1 (9.6-20.6) in men. Over time, relative inequalities in recent HIV testing decreased in both genders, while absolute inequalities plateaued in women and increased in men. Interpretations The overall increase in HIV testing uptake that was stimulated by the impetus to scale up HIV treatment in sub-Saharan Africa led to a decrease in relative inequalities, while absolute inequalities persisted. Within most countries, large inequalities still remained, both in absolute and relative scales, especially in West and Central Africa. A greater focus should be put on equity in monitoring HIV testing programs.

379,"Generating Evidence for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Clinical Guidelines Using EHR Data","Objectives: The aim of this research was to develop data-driven models using electronic health records (EHRs) to conduct clinical studies for predicting clinical outcomes through probabilistic analysis that considers temporal aspects of clinical data. We assess the efficacy of antibiotics treatment and the optimal time of initiation for in-hospitalized diagnosed with acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) as an application to probabilistic modeling. Materials and Methods: We developed a semi-automatic Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) modeling and simulation approach that encodes clinical conditions as computable definitions of health states and exact time duration as input for parameter estimations using raw EHR data. We applied the MCMC approach to the MIMIC-III clinical database, where ICD-9 diagnosis codes (491.21, 491.22, and 494.1) were used to identify data for 697 AECOPD patients of which 25.9% were administered antibiotics. Results: The average time to antibiotic administration was 27 hours, and 32% of patients were administered vancomycin as the initial antibiotic. The model simulations showed a 50% decrease in mortality rate as the number of patients administered antibiotics increased. There was an estimated 5.5% mortality rate when antibiotics were initially administrated after 48 hours vs 1.8% when antibiotics were initially administrated between 24 and 48 hours. Discussion: Our findings suggest that there may be a mortality benefit in initiation of antibiotics early in patient with severe respiratory failure in settings of COPD exacerbations warranting an ICU admission. Conclusion: Probabilistic modeling and simulation methods that considers temporal aspects of raw clinical patient data can be used to adequately generate evidence for clinical guidelines.","Johnson, A.

765,"Cognitive functioning and lifetime Major Depressive Disorder in UK Biobank","Background. Cognitive impairment associated with lifetime Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is well-supported by meta-analytic studies, but population-based estimates remain scarce. Previous UK Biobank studies have only shown limited evidence of cognitive differences related to probable MDD. Using updated cognitive and clinical assessments in UK Biobank, this study investigated population-level differences in cognitive functioning associated with lifetime MDD. Methods. Associations between lifetime MDD and cognition (performance on six tasks and general cognitive functioning (g-factor)) were investigated in UK Biobank (N-range 7,457-14,836, age 45-81 years, 52% female), adjusting for demographics, education and lifestyle. Lifetime MDD classifications were based on the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Within the lifetime MDD group, we additionally investigated relationships between cognition and (i) recurrence, (ii) current symptoms, (iii) severity of psychosocial impairment (while symptomatic), and (iv) concurrent psychotropic medication use. Results. Lifetime MDD was robustly associated with a lower g-factor ({beta} = -0.10, P(FDR) = 4.7x10-5), with impairments in attention, processing speed and executive functioning ({beta} [&ge;] 0.06). Clinical characteristics revealed differential profiles of cognitive impairment among case individuals; those who reported severe psychosocial impairment and use of psychotropic medication performed worse on cognitive tests. Severe psychosocial impairment and reasoning showed the strongest association ({beta} = -0.18, P(FDR) = 7.5x10-5). Conclusions. Findings describe small but robust associations between lifetime MDD and lower cognitive performance within a population based sample. Overall effects were of modest effect size, suggesting limited clinical relevance. However, deficits within specific cognitive domains were more pronounced in relation to clinical characteristics, particularly severe psychosocial impairment.","De Nooij, L.; Harris, M. A.; Adams, M.

343,"Calibration of individual-based models to epidemiological data: a systematic review","Individual-based models (IBMs) informing public health policy should be calibrated to data and provide estimates of uncertainty. Two main components of model-calibration methods are the parameter-search strategy and the goodness-of-fit (GOF) measure; many options exist for each of these. This review provides an overview of calibration methods used in IBMs modelling infectious disease spread. We identified articles on PubMed employing simulation-based methods to calibrate IBMs informing public health policy in HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria epidemiology published between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2018. Articles were included if models stored individual-specific information, and calibration involved comparing model output to population-level targets. We extracted information on parameter-search strategies, GOF measures, and model validation. The PubMed search identified 653 candidate articles, of which 84 met the review criteria. Of the included articles, 40 (48%) combined a quantitative GOF measure with an algorithmic parameter-search strategy - either an optimisation algorithm (14/40) or a sampling algorithm (26/40). These 40 articles varied widely in their choices of parameter-search strategies and GOF measures. For the remaining 44 (52%) articles, the parameter-search strategy could either not be identified (32/44) or was described as an informal, non-reproducible method (12/44). Of these 44 articles, the majority (25/44) were unclear about the GOF measure used; of the rest, only five quantitatively evaluated GOF. Only a minority of the included articles, 14 (17%) provided a rationale for their choice of model-calibration method. Model validation was reported in 31 (37%) articles. Reporting on calibration methods is far from optimal in epidemiological modelling studies of HIV, malaria and TB transmission dynamics. The adoption of better documented, algorithmic calibration methods could improve both reproducibility and the quality of inference in model-based epidemiology. There is a need for research comparing the performance of calibration methods to inform decisions about the parameter-search strategies and GOF measures.","Hazelbag, C. M.; Dushoff, J.; Dominic, E.

311,"Analysis of corneal real astigmatism changes and high order aberration after lower eyelid epiblepharon repair surgery","Objective: To investigate changes in corneal low and high order aberrations (LOA and HOA), which cause visual disturbances after lower eyelid epiblepharon repair surgery. Methods and analysis: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study, which included 108 eyes from 54 patients. Wavefront analyses for calibrated LOAs and HOAs (root mean square, coma, three-piece aberrations [Trefoil], secondary astigmatisms, and spherical aberrations [SA]) were performed via a Galilei G4 Dual Scheimpflug Analyzer preoperatively, at the first and second follow-ups (f/u), and at G1, G2, and G3 (<45 days, 45-75 days, and >75 days post-surgery). Several risk factors (age, sex, body mass index, and corneal keratitis presence) were assessed. Results: In LOAs, flat keratometer (K) and axis values decreased significantly from baseline at the first f/u. At the second f/u, mean K and axis decreased. In HOAs, coma and trefoil increased from baseline at the first f/u and normalized by the second f/u. SA decreased at the second f/u and in G3. The various risk factors did not affect postoperative outcomes, axis, and secondary astigmatisms. After correcting for risk factors, at the first f/u, cylinder, coma, trefoil, and SA increased significantly from the baseline, while axis and flat K decreased. At the second f/u, cylinder increased, while axis and mean K decreased significantly from the baseline. Conclusion: Epiblepharon repair surgery may impact axis changes. Flat K, coma, and trefoil may be affected by mechanical force changes immediately following surgery. Mean K and SA may change with cornea state changes during healing.","Lee, D.",20190909,"Ophthalmology","10.1101/19006080",1,"Dongcheol Lee","Department of ophthalmology, Keimyung University School of Medicine","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19006080v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19006080v1.full.pdf","cc_by",NA,"All data relevant to the study are included in the article or uploaded as supplementary information."
345,"Data-driven discovery of changes in clinical code usage over time: a case-study on changes in cardiovascular disease recording in two English electronic health records databases (2001-2015)","Objectives: To demonstrate how data-driven variability methods can be used to identify changes in disease recording in two English electronic health records databases between 2001-2015. Design: Repeated cross-sectional analysis that applied data-driven temporal variability methods to assess month-by-month changes in routinely-collected medical data. A measure of difference between months was calculated based on joint distributions of age, gender, socio-economic status and recorded cardiovascular diseases. Distances between months were used to identify temporal trends in data recording. Setting: 400 English primary care practices from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD GOLD) and 451 hospital trusts from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). Main outcomes: The proportion of patients (CPRD GOLD) and hospital admissions (HES) with a recorded cardiovascular disease (CPRD GOLD: coronary heart disease, heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, stroke; HES: International Classification of Disease ICD codes I20-I69/G45). Results: Both databases showed gradual changes in cardiovascular disease recording between 2001 and 2008. The recorded prevalence of included cardiovascular diseases in CPRD GOLD increased by 47%-62%, which partially reversed after 2008. For hospital records in HES, there was a relative decrease in angina pectoris (-34.4%) and unspecified stroke (-42.3%) over the same time period, with a concomitant increase in chronic coronary heart disease (+14.3%). Multiple abrupt changes in the use of myocardial infarction codes in hospital were found in March/April 2010, 2012 and 2014, possibly linked to updates of clinical coding guidelines. Conclusions: Identified temporal variability could be related to potentially non-medical causes such as updated coding guidelines. These artificial changes may introduce temporal correlation among diagnoses inferred from routine data, violating the assumptions of frequently used statistical methods. Temporal variability measures provided an objective and robust technique to identify, and subsequently account for, those changes in electronic health records studies without any prior knowledge of the data collection process.","Rockenschaub, P.; Nguyen, V.; Aldridge, R.

849,"Using the Association Between Antibiotic Susceptibility and Genetic Relatedness to Rescue Old Drugs for Empiric Use","Background: Rising rates of antibiotic resistance have led to the use of broader spectrum antibiotics and increasingly compromise empiric therapy. Knowing the antibiotic susceptibility of a pathogens close genetic relative(s) may improve empiric antibiotic selection. Methods: Using genomic and phenotypic data from three separate clinically-derived databases of Escherichia coli isolates, we evaluated multiple genomic methods and statistical models for predicting antibiotic susceptibility, focusing on potentially rapidly available information such as lineage or genetic distance from archived isolates. We applied these methods to derive and validate prediction of antibiotic susceptibility to common antibiotics. Results: We evaluated 968 separate episodes of suspected and confirmed infection with Escherichia coli from three geographically and temporally separated databases in Ontario, Canada, from 2010-2018. The most common sequence type (ST) was ST131 (30%). Antibiotic susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were lowest (<=72%). Across all approaches, model performance (AUC) ranges for predicting antibiotic susceptibility were greatest for ciprofloxacin (0.76-0.97), and lowest for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (0.51-0.80). When a model predicted a susceptible isolate, the resulting (post-test) probabilities of susceptibility were sufficient to warrant empiric therapy for most antibiotics (mean 92%). An approach combining multiple models could permit the use of narrower spectrum oral agents in 2 out of every 3 patients while maintaining high treatment adequacy (approximately 90%). Conclusions: Methods based on genetic relatedness to archived samples in E. coli could be used to rescue older and typically unsuitable agents for use as empiric antibiotic therapy, as well as improve decisions to select newer broader spectrum agents.","Macfadden, D.

Patient self-reporting methods are convenient to apply in clinical practice but need to be validated. Objective: We studied the concordance of a patient self-report method, MMAS (Morisky eight item medication adherence scale) with pill count method in measuring adherence to statins and their correlation with extended lipid profile parameters and serum HMGCoA-R (hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase) enzyme levels. Methods: MMAS and pill count method were used to measure the adherence to statins in patients on statins for any duration. Patients were subjected to estimation of extended lipid profile and serum HMGCoA-R levels at the end of 3 months follow-up. Results: Out of a total of 200 patients included in the study, 117 patients had low adherence (score less than 6 on MMAS) whereas 65 and 18 patients had medium (score 6 to less than 8) and high adherence (score of 8) respectively. Majority of patients who had low adherence to statins by MMAS were nonadherent by pill count method yielding concordance of 96.5%. Medium or high adherence to statins by MMAS method had concordance of 89.1% with pill count method. The levels of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein- cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and HMGCoA-R were significantly negatively correlated with compliance measured by pill count and MMAS with similar correlation coefficients. HMGCoA-R levels demonstrated a plateau phenomenon with levels being 9-10 ng/ml when compliance to statin therapy was greater than 60% by pill count and greater than 6 on Morisky scale. Conclusion: In conclusion, MMAS and pill count methods showed concordance in measuring adherence to statins. These methods need to be explored further for their interchangeability as surrogates for biomarker levels.","Grover, A.; Oberoi, M.; Rehan, H.; Gupta, L.

337,"GWAS-based Machine Learning for Prediction of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Risk","Numerous independent susceptibility variants have been identified for Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Since advanced AMD is currently incurable, an accurate prediction of a person's AMD risk using genetic information is desirable for early diagnosis and clinical management. In this study, genotype data of 32,215 Caucasian individuals with age above 50 years from the International AMD Genomics Consortium in dbGAP were used to establish and validate prediction models for AMD risk using four different machine learning approaches: neural network, lasso regression, support vector machine, and random forest. A standard logistic regression model was also considered using a genetic risk score. To identify feature SNPs for AMD prediction models, we selected the genome-wide significant SNPs from GWAS. All methods achieved good performance for predicting normal controls versus advanced AMD cases (AUC=0.81~0.82 in a separate test dataset) and normal controls versus any AMD (AUC=0.78~0.79). By applying the state-of-art machine learning approaches on the large AMD GWAS data, the predictive models we established can provide an accurate estimation of an individual's AMD risk profile across the person's lifespan based on a comprehensive genetic information.","Yan, Q.; Jiang, Y.; Huang, H.; Swaroop, A.; Chew, E.

313,"Rise and Regional Disparities in Buprenorphine Utilization in the United States","Aims: Buprenorphine is an opioid partial-agonist used to treat Opioid Use Disorders (OUD). While several state and federal policy changes have attempted to increase buprenorphine availability, access remains well below optimal levels. This study characterized how buprenorphine utilization in the United States has changed over time and whether there are regional disparities in distribution. Measurements: Buprenorphine weights distributed from 2007 to 2017 were obtained from the Drug Enforcement Administration. Data was expressed as the percent change and as the mg per person in each state. Separately, the formulations for prescriptions covered by Medicaid (2008 to 2018) were examined. Findings: Buprenorphine distributed to pharmacies increased about seven-fold (476.8 to 3,179.9 kg) while the quantities distributed to hospitals grew five-fold (18.6 to 97.6 kg) nationally from 2007 to 2017. Buprenorphine distribution per person was almost 20-fold higher in Vermont (40.4 mg/person) relative to South Dakota (2.1 mg/person). There was a strong association between the number of waivered physicians per 100K population and distribution per state (r(49) = +0.76, p < .0005). The buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film (Suboxone) was the predominant formulation (92.6% of 0.31 million Medicaid prescriptions) in 2008 but this accounted for less than three-fifths (57.3% of 6.56 million prescriptions) in 2018. Conclusions: Although buprenorphine availability has substantially increased over the last decade, distribution was very non-homogenous across the US.","Pashmineh, A. A.

336,"Deep-learning-based Prediction of Late Age-Related Macular Degeneration Progression","Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Previous genetic and epidemiological studies have shown that the AMD progression are affected by genetic variants and environmental factors. AMD severity is mainly diagnosed by color fundus images and recent studies have shown the success of machine learning methods in predicting AMD progression using image data. However, none of the studies have utilized both genetics and image data for predicting AMD progression. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), a large-scale clinical trial from the National Eye Institute, includes massive genome-wide genotyping data, longitudinal color fundus photographs, and disease severity assessment over a period of 12 years, providing an unprecedented opportunity to investigate prediction models for AMD progression. In this report, we jointly used genotypes and fundus images to dynamically predict an eye as having progressed to late AMD (e.g., whether the time to progression to late AMD for the eye exceeds 3 years from the current visit) with a modified deep convolutional neural network (CNN). In total, we used 31,262 color fundus images centered on the macula from 1,351 subjects with corresponding genotypes and phenotypes available at baseline and follow-up visits. The first part of this model was derived from a CNN to extract features. Our results showed that the color fundus photos coupled with genotypes could predict late AMD progression with an averaged area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.85 (95%CI: 0.83-0.86). The results using fundus images alone showed an AUC of 0.81 (95%CI: 0.80-0.83). We have validated our results in an independent dataset of 200 Caucasians extracted from UK Biobank and the results showed an AUC of 0.9 (95%CI: 0.85-0.94) for predicting whether the eye progresses to late AMD exceeding the 3 years. We implemented our model in a cloud-based application for individual risk assessment.","Yan, Q.; Weeks, D. E.; Xin, H.; Huang, H.; Swaroop, A.; Chew, E.

416,"Assessing psychiatric comorbid disorders of cognition: A machine learning approach using UK Biobank data","Background Conceptualising comorbidity is complex and the term is used variously. Here, it is the coexistence of two or more diagnoses which might be defined as chronic and, although they may be pathologically related, they may also act independently 1. Of interest here is the comorbidity of common psychiatric disorders and impaired cognition. Objectives To examine whether anxiety and/or depression are important longitudinal predictors of impaired cognition. Methods UK Biobank participants used at three timepoints (n= 502,664): baseline, 1st follow-up (n= 20,257) and 1st imaging study (n=40,199). Participants with no missing data were 1,159 participants aged 40 to 70 years, 41% female. Machine learning (ML) was applied and the main outcome measure of reaction time intraindividual variability (cognition) was used. Findings Using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, the anxiety model achieves the best performance with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.68, followed by the depression model with an AUC of 0.64. The cardiovascular and diabetes model, and the demographics model have weaker performance in predicting cognition, with an AUC of 0.60 and 0.57, respectively. Conclusions Outcomes suggest psychiatric disorders are more important comorbidities of long-term cognitive change than diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and demographic factors. Findings suggest that mental health disorders (anxiety and depression) may have a deleterious effect on long-term cognition and should be considered as an important comorbid disorder of cognitive decline. Clinical implications Important predictive effects of poor mental health on longitudinal cognitive decline should be considered in primary care.","Li, C.; Gheorghe, D. A.; Gallacher, J.

312,"RISK6, a universal 6-gene transcriptomic signature of TB disease risk, diagnosis and treatment response","Improved tuberculosis diagnostics and tools for monitoring treatment response are urgently needed. We developed a robust and simple, PCR-based host-blood transcriptomic signature, RISK6, for multiple applications: identifying individuals at risk of incident disease, as a screening test for subclinical or clinical tuberculosis, and for monitoring tuberculosis treatment. RISK6 utility was validated by blind prediction using quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR in seven independent cohorts. Prognostic performance significantly exceeded that of previous signatures discovered in the same cohort. Performance for diagnosing subclinical and clinical disease in HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected persons, assessed by area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, exceeded 85%. As a screening test for tuberculosis, the sensitivity at 90% specificity met or approached the benchmarks set out in World Health Organization target product profiles for non-sputum-based tests. RISK6 scores correlated with lung immunopathology activity, measured by positron emission tomography, and tracked treatment response, demonstrating utility as treatment response biomarker, while predicting treatment failure prior to treatment initiation. Performance of the test in capillary blood samples collected by finger-prick was noninferior to venous blood collected in PAXgene tubes. These results support incorporation of RISK6 into rapid, capillary blood-based point-of-care PCR devices for prospective assessment in field studies.","Penn-Nicholson, A.; Mbandi, S.

347,"Healthy ageing men have normal reproductive function but display germline-specific molecular changes","Children of older fathers have higher risk for certain diseases. Nevertheless, how ageing specifically affects male germ cells is so far not completely understood. In a cohort of 197 healthy men (18-84 years), we found that semen and reproductive parameters remained normal over six decades. Along with an age-dependent increase in telomere length in sperm (r=0.41, p>0.001), we found accelerated DNA fragmentation, more prominent after the sixth decate of life, and with around 60% of men older than 66 showing abnormal levels of DNA breaks. At the epigenetic level, by whole genome bisulfite sequencing we identified 236 sperm-specific differentially methylated regions between the youngest and oldest group, affecting mostly regions associated with homeobox genes and nervous system development. Therefore, we propose that during ageing, male germ cells are affected by an intrinsic and specific ageing process, distinguishable from the soma. These age-dependent changes might have consequences for fertility and offspring of older men.","Laurentino, S.; Cremers, J.-F.; Horsthemke, B.; Tuettelmann, F.; Czeloth, K.; Zitzmann, M.; Pohl, E.; Rahmann, S.; Schroeder, C.; Berres, S.; Redmann, K.; Krallmann, C.; Schlatt, S.; Kliesch, S.; Gromoll, J.",20190916,"Sexual And Reproductive Health","10.1101/19006221",1,"Stefan Schlatt","Centre of Reproductive Medicine and Andrology, University of Muenster","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19006221v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19006221v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"WGBS data was deposited at the European Nucleotide Archive under the accession number PRJEB28044."
394,"Investigating the added value of biomarkers compared with self-reported smoking in predicting future e-cigarette use: Evidence from a longitudinal UK cohort study","Introduction Biomarkers can be used to assess smoking behaviour more accurately and objectively than self-report. This study assessed the association between cotinine (a biomarker of smoke exposure) and later e-cigarette use among a population who were unexposed to e-cigarettes in youth. Methods Young people in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children took part in the study. We observed associations between cotinine at 15 years (measured between 2006 and 2008 before the wide availability of e-cigarettes) and self-reported ever use of e-cigarettes at 22 (measured between 2014 and 2015 when e-cigarettes were widely available) using logistic regression. A range of potential confounders were adjusted for (age, sex, body mass index, alcohol use and passive smoke exposure). Additionally, we adjusted for the young people's self-reported smoking status/history to explore potential misreporting and measurement error. Results In a sample of N=1,194 young people, cotinine levels consistent with active smoking at 15 years were associated with increased odds of e-cigarette ever use at 22 years (OR=7.24, 95% CI 3.29 to 15.93) even when self-reported active smoking status at age 16 (OR=3.14, 95% CI 1.32 to 7.48) and latent classes of smoking behaviour from 14 to 16 (OR=2.70, 95% CI 0.98 to 7.44) were included in the model. Conclusions Cotinine levels consistent with smoking in adolescence were strongly associated with increased odds of later e-cigarette use, even after adjusting for reported smoking behaviour at age 16 and smoking transitions from 14 to 16.","Khouja, J.

413,"A Hybrid Machine Learning Framework to Predict Early Risk of Mortality in Paralytic Ileus Patients using Electronic Health Records.","Background and Objective: Paralytic Ileus (PI) is the pseudo-obstruction of the intestine secondary to intestinal muscle paralysis. PI is caused by several reasons such as overuse of medications, spinal injuries, inflammation, abdominal surgery, etc. We have developed an early mortality prediction framework that can help intensivist, surgeons, and other medical professionals to optimize clinical management for PI patients in terms of optimal treatment strategy and resource planning. Methods: We used a publicly available ICU database called MIMIC III v1.4, extracted patients that had paralytic ileus as a primary diagnosis over the age of 18 years old. We developed the FLAIM Framework a two-phase model (Phase I: Statistical testing and Phase II: Machine Learning application) that compared to traditional methods of machine learning. We used five different machine learning algorithms to test the validity of our Framework. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed framework by comparing accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, and area under the curve (AUC) for each model. Results: The most considerable improvement in AUC of 7.78% was observed due to the application of the proposed FLAIM method. Additionally, almost for all the machine learning models, an increase in accuracy was also found. With the FLAIM framework, we recorded an accuracy of 81.30% and AUC of 81.38% under the support vector machine (with RBF kernel) model in predicting mortality during a hospital stay for the PI patients. Discussion: Our results show promising clinical outcome prediction and application for individual patients admitted to the ICU with paralytic ileus after the first 24 hours of admission.","Ahmed, F.

441,"Methodology for tDCS integration with fMRI","Integration of tDCS with fMRI holds promise for investigation the underlying mechanism of stimulation effect. There are 118 published tDCS studies (up to 1st Oct 2018) that used fMRI as a proxy measure of neural activation to answer mechanistic, predictive, and localization questions about how brain activity is modulated by tDCS. FMRI can potentially contribute as: a measure of cognitive state-level variance in baseline brain activation before tDCS; inform the design of stimulation montages that aim to target functional networks during specific tasks; and act as an outcome measure of functional response to tDCS. In this systematic review we explore methodological parameter space of tDCS integration with fMRI. Existing tDCS-fMRI literature shows little replication across these permutations; few studies used comparable study designs. Here, we use a case study with both task and resting state fMRI before and after tDCS in a cross-over design to discuss methodological confounds. We further outline how computational models of current flow should be combined with imaging data to understand sources of variability in responsiveness. Through the case study, we demonstrate how modeling and imaging methodology can be integrated for individualized analysis. Finally, we discuss the importance of conducting tDCS-fMRI with stimulation equipment certified as safe to use inside the MR scanner, and of correcting for image artifacts caused by tDCS. tDCS-fMRI can address important questions on the functional mechanisms of tDCS action (e.g. target engagement) and has the potential to support enhancement of behavioral interventions, provided studies are designed rationally.","Esmaeilpour, Z.; Shereen, A.

349,"Evaluation of the causal effects of blood lipid levels on gout with summary level GWAS data: two-sample Mendelian randomization and mediation analysis","Objective: Many observational studies have identified that gout patients are often comorbid with dyslipidemia, which is typically characterized by a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) and an increase in triglycerides (TG). However, the relationship between dyslipidemia and gout is still unclear. Methods: We first performed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to evaluate the causal effect of four lipid traits on gout and serum urate based on summary association statistics available from large scale genome-wide association studies (up to ~100,000 for lipid, 69,374 for gout and 110,347 for serum urate). We adopted multivariable Mendelian randomization to estimate the causal effect independently. We also assessed the mediated effect by serum urate between lipids and gout with a mediation analysis. The MR results were validated with extensive sensitive analyses. Results: Genetically lower HDL was positively associated with the risk of gout and serum urate concentration. Each standard deviation (SD) (~12.26 mg/dL) increase was genetically associated with an odds ratio of gout of 0.75 (95% CI 0.62 ~ 0.91, p = 3.31E-3) and with a 0.09 mg/dL (95% CI: -0.12 ~ -0.05, p = 7.00E-04) decrease in serum urate concentration. Genetically higher TG was positively associated with the serum urate concentration. Each SD (~112.33 mg/dL) increase was genetically associated with a 0.10 mg/dL (95% CI: 0.06 ~ 0.14, p = 9.87E-05) increase in serum urate concentration. Those results were robust against various sensitive analyses. In addition, the multivariable Mendelian randomization confirmed the independent effect of HDL and TG on the gout/serum urate after adjustment for the other lipids. Finally, the mediation analysis showed that both HDL and TG could indirectly affect gout morbidity via the pathway of serum urate. The mediation effect accounted for about 13.0% or 28.0% of the total effect of HDL and TG, respectively. Conclusion: Our study confirmed the causal associations between HDL/TG and gout/ serum urate. Furthermore, the effect of HDL or TG on gout could also be mediated by serum urate.

351,"Understanding pretreatment loss to follow-up of tuberculosis patients: an explanatory qualitative study in Chennai, India","Introduction: Pretreatment loss to follow-up (PTLFU)--dropout of patients after diagnosis but before registration in treatment--is a major gap in TB care delivery in India and globally. Patient and healthcare worker (HCW) perspectives are critical for developing interventions to address this problem. Methods: We prospectively tracked newly diagnosed smear-positive TB patients from 22 TB diagnostic centers in Chennai, one of the largest cities in India. Patients who did not start therapy within 14 days, or who died or were lost to follow-up before official registration in treatment, were classified as PTLFU cases. We conducted qualitative interviews with all trackable PTLFU patients, or family members of patients who had died. We conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) with three types of HCWs involved in TB care. Interview and FGD recordings were transcribed, coded, and analyzed with the support of Dedoose 8.0.35 software to identify key themes. We created categories into which these themes clustered, identified relationships among thematic categories, and assembled findings into a broader explanatory model for PTLFU. Results: We conducted six FGDs comprising 53 HCWs and 33 individual patient or family member interviews. Themes clustered into five categories. Examining relationships among these categories revealed two pathways leading to PTLFU as part of a broader explanatory model. In the first pathway, administrative and organizational health system barriers--including the complexity of navigating the system, healthcare worker absenteeism, and infrastructure failures--resulted in patients feeling frustration or resignation, leading to disengagement from care. Health system barriers experienced by patients were in turn shaped by constraints that made it difficult for HCWs to do their jobs effectively. In the second pathway, negative or judgmental HCW attitudes and behaviors towards patients contributed to patient distrust of the health system, resulting in refusal of further care. Conclusion: Health system barriers contribute substantially to PTLFU directly and by amplifying patient-related challenges to engaging in care. Interventions should focus on removing administrative hurdles patients face in the health system, improving the quality of the HCW-patient interaction, and alleviating constraints HCWs face in being able to provide optimal patient-centered care.","Thomas, B.

317,"Dissociative experiences in fibromyalgia are mediated by symptoms of autonomic dysfunction","Background: Fibromyalgia is characterised by chronic widespread pain. Quality of life is further reduced by autonomic and cognitive symptoms, including subjective brain-fog and dissociative experiences. Although an association with joint hypermobility suggests variant connective tissue is a factor in both fibromyalgia and dysautonomia, the mechanisms underlying the neuropsychiatric symptoms are poorly understood. Methods: 21 fibromyalgia patients and 21 healthy controls were assessed for joint hypermobility dissociative experiences, autonomic symptoms and interoceptive sensibility. Mediation analyses were conducted according to the method of Baron and Kenny. Results: Patients with fibromyalgia reported greater dissociative experiences and autonomic symptoms. The relationship between fibromyalgia and dissociative experiences was fully mediated by symptoms of orthostatic intolerance. Fibromyalgia, dissociative experiences and orthostatic intolerance all were associated with joint hypermobility and interoceptive sensibility. Conclusions: This exploratory investigation highlights the relationship between dissociative experiences in the context of fibromyalgia and subjective experience of aberrant physiological responses. These findings can enhance the recognition and management of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with fibromyalgia, wherein dissociative experiences reflect disturbance of self-representation that can arise through abnormalities in internal agency, autonomic (dys)control and interoceptive prediction errors.","Aslanyan, D.; Iodice, V.; Davies, K.

367,"Predicting Cost-Effectiveness of Generic Versus Brand Dabigatran Using Pharmacometric Estimates among Patients with Atrial Fibrillation in the United States","Generic entry of newer anticoagulants is expected to decrease the costs of atrial fibrillation management. However, when making switches between brand and generic medications, bioequivalence failures are possible. The objectives of this study were to predict and compare the lifetime cost-effectiveness of brand dabigatran with hypothetical future generics. Markov micro-simulations were modified to predict the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years of patients on either brand or generic dabigatran from a U.S. private payer perspective. Event rates for generics were predicted using previously developed pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models. The analyses showed that generic dabigatran with lower-than-brand systemic exposure was dominant. Meanwhile, generic dabigatran with extremely high systemic exposure was not cost-effective compared to the brand reference. Cost-effectiveness of generic medications cannot always be assumed as shown in this example. Combined use of pharmacometric and pharmacoeconomic models can assist in decision making between brand and generic pharmacotherapies.","Wang, C.-Y.; Pham, P.; Kim, S.; Lingineni, K.; Schmidt, S.; Diaby, V.; Brown, J.",20190920,"Pharmacology And Therapeutics","10.1101/19006346",1,"Joshua Brown","University of Florida","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19006346v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19006346v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc",NA,"All data (model inputs) are reported in the manuscript"

444,"A method for complete characterization of complex germline rearrangements from long DNA reads","Many genetic/genomic disorders are caused by genomic rearrangements. Standard methods can often characterize these variations only partly, e.g. copy number changes. We describe full characterization of complex chromosomal rearrangements, based on whole-genome-coverage sequencing of long DNA reads from four patients with chromosomal translocations. We developed a new analysis pipeline, which filters out rearrangements seen in humans without the same disease, reducing the number of loci per patient from a few thousand to a few dozen. For one patient with two reciprocal chromosomal translocations, we find that the translocation points have complex rearrangements of multiple DNA fragments involving 5 chromosomes, which we could order and orient by an automatic algorithm, thereby fully reconstructing the rearrangement. Some important properties of these rearrangements, such as sequence loss, are holistic: they cannot be inferred from any part of the rearrangement, but only from the fully-reconstructed rearrangement. In this patient, the rearrangements were evidently caused by shattering of the chromosomes into multiple fragments, which rejoined in a different order and orientation with loss of some fragments. Our approach promises to fully characterize many congenital germline rearrangement, provided they do not involve poorly-understood loci such as centromeric repeats.","Mitsuhashi, S.; Ohori, S.; Katoh, K.; Frith, M.

411,"EventEpi -- A Natural Language Processing Framework for Event-Based Surveillance","According to the World Health Organization (WHO), around 60% of all outbreaks are detected using informal sources. In many public-health institutes, including the WHO and the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), dedicated groups of epidemiologists sift through numerous articles and newsletters to detect relevant events. This media screening is one important part of event-based surveillance (EBS). Reading the articles, discussing their relevance, and putting key information into a database is a time-consuming process. To support EBS, but also to gain insights into what makes an article and the event it describes relevant, we developed a natural-language-processing framework for automated information extraction and relevance scoring. First, we scraped relevant sources for EBS as done at RKI (WHO Disease Outbreak News and ProMED) and automatically extracted the articles' key data: disease, country, date, and confirmed-case count. For this, we performed named entity recognition in two steps: EpiTator, an open-source epidemiological annotation tool, suggested many different possibilities for each. We trained a naive Bayes classifier to find the single most likely one using RKI's EBS database as labels. Then, for relevance scoring, we defined two classes to which any article might belong: The article is relevant if it is in the EBS database and irrelevant otherwise. We compared the performance of different classifiers, using document and word embeddings. Two of the tested algorithms stood out: The multilayer perceptron performed best overall, with a precision of 0.19, recall of 0.50, specificity of 0.89, F1 of 0.28, and the highest tested index balanced accuracy of 0.46. The support-vector machine, on the other hand, had the highest recall (0.88) which can be of higher interest for epidemiologists. Finally, we integrated these functionalities into a web application called EventEpi where relevant sources are automatically analyzed and put into a database. The user can also provide any URL or text, that will be analyzed in the same way and added to the database. Each of these steps could be improved, in particular with larger labeled datasets and fine-tuning of the learning algorithms. The overall framework, however, works already well and can be used in production, promising improvements in EBS.

326,"Intrinsic capacity as a framework for Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE); insights from the 10/66 Dementia Research Group cohort studies in Latin America, India and China","Background The World Health Organization has reframed health and healthcare for older people around achieving the goal of healthy ageing. Recent evidence-based guidelines on Integrated Care for Older People focus on maintaining intrinsic capacity, addressing declines in mobility, nutrition, vision and hearing, cognition, mood and continence aiming to prevent or delay the onset of care dependence. The target group (with one or more declines in intrinsic capacity) is broad, and implementation at scale may be challenging in less-resourced settings. Planning can be informed by assessing the prevalence of intrinsic capacity, characterising the target group, and validating the general approach by evaluating risk prediction for incident dependence and mortality. Methods Population-based cohort studies in urban sites in Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and rural and urban sites in Peru, Mexico, India and China. Sociodemographic, behaviour and lifestyle, health, healthcare utilisation and cost questionnaires, and physical assessments were administered to all participants, with ascertainment of incident dependence, and mortality, three to five years later. Results In the 12 sites in eight countries, 17,031 participants were surveyed at baseline. Intrinsic capacity was least likely to be retained for locomotion (71.2%), vision (71.3%), cognition (73.5%), and mood (74.1%). Only 30% retained full capacity across all domains, varying between one quarter and two-fifths in most sites. The proportion retaining capacity fell sharply with increasing age, and declines affecting multiple domains were more common. Poverty, morbidity (particularly dementia, depression and stroke), and disability were concentrated among those with DIC, although only 10% were frail, and a further 9% had needs for care. Hypertension and lifestyle risk factors for chronic disease, healthcare utilization and costs were more evenly distributed in the general older population. 15,901 participants were included in the mortality cohort (2,602 deaths/ 53,911 person years of follow-up), and 12,965 participants in the dependence cohort (1900 incident cases/ 38,377 person-years). DIC (any decline, and number of domains affected) strongly and independently predicted incident dependence and death. Relative risks were higher for those who were frail, but were also substantially elevated for the much larger sub-groups yet to become frail. Mortality was mainly concentrated in the frail and dependent sub-groups. Conclusions Our findings support the strategy to focus on optimizing intrinsic capacity in pursuit of healthy ageing. Most needs for care arise in those with declines in intrinsic capacity who are yet to become frail. Implementation at scale requires community-based screening and assessment, and a stepped-care approach to intervention. Community healthcare workers roles would need redefinition to engage, train and support them in these tasks. ICOPE could be usefully integrated into community programmes orientated to the detection and case management of chronic diseases including hypertension and diabetes.","Prince, M.

736,"Inferring the role of the microbiome on survival in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors: causal modeling, timing, and classes of concomitant medications","The microbiome has been shown to affect the response to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) in a small number of cancers. Here, we sought to more broadly survey cancers to identify those in which the microbiome will play a role using retrospective analyses. We created a causal model for the relationship between medications, the microbiome and ICI response and used it to guide the abstraction of electronic health records of 690 patients who received ICI therapy for advanced cancer. Medications associated with changes to the microbiome including antibiotics, corticosteroids, proton pump inhibitors, histamine receptor blockers, non-steroid anti-inflammatories and statins were abstracted. We tested the effect of medication timing on overall survival (OS) and evaluated the robustness of medication effects in each cancer. Finally, we compared the size of the effect observed for antibiotics classes to taxa correlated with ICI response and a literature review of culture-based antibiotic susceptibilities. Of the medications assessed, only antibiotics and corticosteroids significantly associated with lower OS. The hazard ratios (HRs) for antibiotics and corticosteroids were highest near the start of ICI treatment but remained significant when given prior to ICI. Antibiotics and corticosteroids remained significantly associated with OS even when controlling for multiple factors such as Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, Charlson Comorbidity Index score, and stage. When grouping antibiotics by class, {beta}-lactams showed the strongest association with OS across all tested cancers. The timing and strength of these effects after controlling for confounding factors are consistent with role for the microbiome in response to ICIs.","Spakowicz, D.; Hoyd, R.; Husain, M.; Bassett, J.

373,"Nothing About Us Without Us: A Scoping Review and Priority-Setting Partnership in Type 1 Diabetes and Exercise","Objectives: Examine the characteristics of patient engagement (PE) practices in exercise-based randomized trials in type 1 diabetes (T1D), and facilitate T1D stakeholders in determining the top ten list of priorities for exercise research. Design: Two methodological approaches were employed: a scoping review and a modified James Lind Alliance priority-setting partnership. Methods: Published (Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Central databases) and grey literature (www.clinicaltrials.gov) were searched to identify randomized controlled trials of exercise interventions lasting minimum four weeks and available in English. We extracted information on PE and patient-reported outcomes (PROMs) to identify if patient perspectives had been implemented. Based on results, we set out to determine exercise research priorities as a first step towards a patient-engaged research agenda. An online survey was distributed across Canada to collect research questions from patients, caregivers and healthcare providers. We qualitatively analyzed submitted questions and compiled a long-list that a twelve-person stakeholder steering committee used to identify the top ten priority research questions. Results: Of 9,962 identified sources, 19 published trials and 4 trial registrations fulfilled inclusion criteria. No evidence of PE existed in any included study. Most commonly measured PROMs were frequency of hypoglycemia (n=7) and quality of life (n=4). The priority-setting survey yielded 194 submitted research questions. Steering committee rankings identified 10 priorities focused on lifestyle factors and exercise modifications to maintain short-term glycemic control. Conclusion: Recent exercise-based randomized trials in T1D have not included PE and PROMs. Patient priorities for exercise research have yet to be addressed with adequately designed clinical trials.","Klaprat, N.

1053,"Multifocal breast cancers are more prevalent in BRCA2 versus BRCA1 mutation carriers","Multifocal breast cancer is generally considered to be where two or more breast tumours are present within the same breast, but are clearly separated with no intervening in situ or invasive disease. It is seen in ~10% of breast cancer cases. This study investigates multifocality prevalence in BRCA1/2 mutant patients via cross-sectional analysis. Data from 211 women with BRCA1/2 mutations (91 BRCA1), (120 BRCA2), with breast cancer were collected including age, tumour focality, size, type, grade, and receptor profile. The prevalence of multifocality within this group was 25%, but within subgroups, prevalence amongst BRCA2 carriers was more than double that of BRCA1 carriers (p=0.001). Women affected by multifocal tumours had proportionately higher oestrogen receptor positivity (p=0.001), lower triple negativity (p=0.004), and were more likely to be younger at diagnosis compared with those with unifocal tumours (p=0.039). Odds of a BRCA2 carrier developing multifocal cancer were almost four-fold higher than a BRCA1 carrier (OR: 3.71, CI: 1.77 to 7.78, p=0.001). BRCA2 carriers show much greater multifocality than those carrying BRCA1. Multifocal tumours are strongly associated with being both BRCA2 mutant and oestrogen receptor positive.","Mccrorie, A.

328,"Village-scale persistence and elimination of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis","Gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT) is one of several neglected tropical diseases that is targeted for elimination by the World Health Organization. Recent years have seen a substantial decline in the number of globally reported cases, largely driven by an intensive process of screening and treatment. However, this infection is highly focal, continuing to persist at low prevalence even in small populations. Regional elimination, and ultimately global eradication, rests on understanding the dynamics and persistence of this infection at the local population scale. Here we develop a stochastic model of gHAT dynamics, which is underpinned by screening and reporting data from one of the highest gHAT incidence regions, Kwilu Province, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We use this model to explore the persistence of gHAT in villages of different population sizes and subject to different patterns of screening. Our models demonstrate that infection is expected to persist for long periods even in relatively small isolated populations. We further use the model to assess the risk of recrudescence following local elimination and consider how failing to detect cases during active screening events informs the probability of elimination. These quantitative results provide insights for public health policy in the region, particularly highlighting the difficulties in achieving and measuring the 2030 elimination goal.","Davis, C.

378,"Genome-wide association and multi-omic analyses reveal new mechanisms for Heart Failure","Heart failure is a major medical and economic burden in the healthcare system affecting over 23 million people worldwide. Although recent pedigree studies estimate heart failure heritability around 26%, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have had limited success in explaining disease pathogenesis. We conducted the largest meta-analysis of heart failure GWAS to-date and replicated our findings in a comparable sized cohort to identify one known and two novel variants associated with heart failure. Leveraging heart failure sub-phenotyping and fine-mapping, we reveal a putative causal variant found in a cardiac muscle specific regulatory region that binds to the ACTN2 cardiac sarcolemmal gene and affects left ventricular adverse remodeling and clinical heart failure in response to different initial cardiac muscle insults. Via genetic correlation, we show evidence of broadly shared heritability between heart failure and multiple musculoskeletal traits. Our findings extend our understanding of biological mechanisms underlying heart failure.","Arvanitis, M.; Zhang, Y.; Wang, W.; Auton, A.; 23andme Research Team,  ; Keramati, A. R.; Chi, N.

442,"BAck Complaints in the Elders - Chiropractic (BACE-C): Design of a cohort study in chiropractic care","Background: Low back pain is a common condition among older adults that significantly influences physical function and participation. Compared to their younger counterparts, there is limited information available about the clinical course of low back pain in older people, in particularly those presenting for chiropractic care. Improving our understanding of this patient population and the course of their low back pain may provide input for studies researching safer and more effective care than is currently provided.

Objectives: The primary objectives are to examine the clinical course over one year of the intensity, healthcare costs and improvement rates of low back pain in people 55 years and older who visit a chiropractor for a new episode of low back pain.

Methods: An international prospective, multi-center cohort study with one-year follow-up. Chiropractic practices are to be recruited in the Netherlands, Sweden, United Kingdom and Australia. Treatment will be left to the discretion of the chiropractor. Inclusion/Exclusion criteria: Patients 55 years and older who are accepted for care having presented to a chiropractor with a new episode of low back pain and who have not been to a chiropractor in the previous six months for an episode of low back pain are to be included, independent of whether or not they have seen another type of health care provider. Patients who are unable to complete the web-based questionnaires because of language restrictions or those with computer literacy restrictions will be excluded as well as those with cognitive disorders. In addition, those with a suspected tumor, fracture, infection or any other potential red flag or condition considered to be a contraindication for chiropractic care will be excluded. Data will be collected using online questionnaires at baseline, and at 2 and 6 weeks and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.","Jenks, A.; Rubinstein, S.

327,"Genetic liability to schizophrenia is associated with exposure to traumatic events in childhood","Background: There is a wealth of literature on the observed association between childhood trauma and psychotic illness. However, the relationship between childhood trauma and psychosis is complex and could be explained, in part, by gene-environment correlation. Methods: The association between schizophrenia polygenic scores (PGS) and experiencing childhood trauma was investigated using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). Schizophrenia PGS were derived in each cohort for children, mothers, and fathers where genetic data were available. Measures of trauma exposure were derived based on data collected throughout childhood and adolescence (0-17 years; ALSPAC) and at age 8 years (MoBa). Results: Within ALSPAC, we found a positive association between schizophrenia PGS and exposure to trauma across childhood and adolescence; effect sizes were consistent for both child or maternal PGS. We found evidence of an association between the schizophrenia PGS and the majority of trauma subtypes investigated, with the exception of bullying. These results were comparable in MoBa. Within ALSPAC, genetic liability to a range of additional psychiatric traits was also associated with a greater trauma exposure. Conclusions: Results from two international birth cohorts indicate that genetic liability for a range of psychiatric traits is associated with experiencing childhood trauma. GWAS of psychiatric phenotypes may also reflect risk factors for these phenotypes. Our findings also suggest that youth at higher genetic risk might require greater resources/support to ensure they grow-up in a healthy environment.","Sallis, H. M.; Croft, J.; Havdahl, A.; Jones, H.

Method: Seventeen ambulatory children with CP and 28 typically developing children, all 5-12 years of age, were recruited for this cross-sectional, observational study. Balance reaction skill was quantified as anterior and posterior single-stepping thresholds, or the treadmill-induced perturbations that consistently elicited a step in that direction. In order to understand underlying mechanisms of between-group differences in stepping thresholds, dynamic stability was quantified using the minimum margin of stability. Ankle muscle activation latency, magnitude, and co-contraction were assessed with surface electromyography. Results: We observed large between-group differences in anterior, but not posterior, thresholds. Between-group differences were most evident in older children, with typically developing children having larger anterior thresholds than those with CP. In response to near-threshold anterior perturbations, older typically developing children recovered from more instability than their CP peers. Older children had no between-group differences in ankle muscle activity. Interpretation: The effects of CP on balance reactions are age- and direction-specific. In response to an anterior perturbation, older typically developing children recovered from more instability than their peers with CP.","Crenshaw, J. R.; Petersen, D. A.; Conner, B. C.; Tracy, J.

389,"Efficacy and safety of erythropoietin for traumatic brain injury: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials","Objective Recent studies regarding the effects of erythropoietin (EPO) for treating traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been inconsistent. This study conducts a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the safety and efficacy of EPO for TBI patients at various follow-up time points. Methods A literature search was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar and the Cochrane Library for RCTs studying EPO in TBI patients published through March 2019. Non-English manuscripts and non-human studies were excluded. The assessed outcomes include mortality, neurological recovery and associated adverse effects. Dichotomous variables are presented as risk ratios (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Results A total of seven RCTs involving 1197 TBI patients were included in this study. Compared to the placebo arm, treatment with EPO did not improve acute hospital mortality or short-term mortality. However, there was a significant improvement in mid-term (6 months) follow-up survival rates. EPO administration was not associated with neurological function improvement. Regarding adverse effects, EPO treatment did not increase the incidence of thromboembolic events or other associated adverse events. Conclusions This meta-analysis indicates a slight mortality benefit for TBI patients treated with EPO at mid-term follow-up. EPO does not improve in-hospital mortality, nor does it increase adverse events including thrombotic, cardiovascular and other associated complications. Our analysis did not demonstrate a significant beneficial effect of EPO intervention on the recovery of neurological function. Future RCTs are required to further characterize the use of EPO in TBI.

325,"Gender dependent pharmacotherapy for blocking transition to chronic back pain: a proof of concept randomized trial","Preventing transition to chronic back pain (CBP) is an ideal strategy that would rescue patients from years to a lifetime of suffering with pain. Recent studies suggest involvement of sexually-dimorphic dopaminergic-motivational circuits in the transition to chronic pain (tCBP), and hints the combination of carbidopa/levodopa and naproxen (LDP+NPX) may block tCBP. We tested these concepts in early onset BP, who were stratified by risk for tCBP using brain properties. Those identified as low-risk entered a no-treatment arm. The rest were randomized into a double-blind, placebo and naproxen (PLC+NPX) controlled trial of oral LDP+NPX for 12 weeks, and a post-treatment 12-weeks follow-up. 59 participants completed the study. Both treatments resulted in ~50% pain relief for ~75%, sustained post-treatment. LDP+NPX was highly effective in females (>80% pain relief), it modified BP personality, and was related to objective brain functional changes. Although performed in a small group of early onset BP, multiple subjective and objective measures consistently suggest that these long-duration treatments persistently, and gender-dependently, block tCBP.","Reckziegel, D.; Tetreault, P.; Ghantous, M.; Wakaizumi, K.; Petre, B.; Huang, L.; Jabakhanji, R.; Abdullah, T.; Vachon-Presseau, E.; Berger, S.

Methods We developed a method that accurately identifies the CN of SMN1 and SMN2 using genome sequencing (GS) data by analyzing read depth and eight informative reference genome differences between SMN1/2. Results We characterized SMN1/2 in 12,747 genomes, identified 1568 samples with SMN1 gains or losses and 6615 samples with SMN2 gains or losses and calculated a pan-ethnic carrier frequency of 2%, consistent with previous studies. Additionally, 99.8% of our SMN1 and 99.7% of SMN2 CN calls agreed with orthogonal methods, with a recall of 100% for SMA and 97.8% for carriers, and a precision of 100% for both SMA and carriers. Conclusion This SMN copy number caller can be used to identify both carrier and affected status of SMA, enabling SMA testing to be offered as a comprehensive test in neonatal care and an accurate carrier screening tool in GS sequencing projects.","Chen, X.; Sanchis-Juan, A.; French, C.

362,"Predicting individual clinical trajectories of depression with generative embedding","Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) show heterogeneous treatment response and highly variable clinical trajectories: while some patients experience swift and enduring recovery, others show relapsing-remitting or chronic disease course. Predicting individual clinical trajectories at an early disease stage is a key challenge for psychiatry and might facilitate individually tailored interventions. So far, however, reliable predictors at the single-patient level are absent. Here, we evaluated the utility of a machine learning strategy - generative embedding - which combines an interpretable generative model with a discriminative classifier. Specifically, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of emotional face perception in 85 MDD patients from the multi-site longitudinal NEtherlands Study of Depression and Anxiety (NESDA) who had been followed up over two years and classified into three subgroups with distinct clinical trajectories. Combining a generative model of effective (directed) connectivity with support vector machines (SVMs), it was possible to predict whether a given patient will experience chronic depression vs. fast remission with a balanced accuracy of 79%. Gradual improvement vs. fast remission could still be predicted above-chance, but less convincingly, with a balanced accuracy of 61%. Importantly, generative embedding outperformed conventional (descriptive) measures such as functional connectivity or local BOLD activity, which did not predict clinical trajectories with above-chance accuracy. Furthermore, the predictive performance of generative embedding could be assigned to a specific network property: the dynamic modulation of connections by the emotional content of the trial-by-trial stimuli. Our findings suggest that a mechanistically informed generative model of a neuronal circuit underlying emotional face perception may have predictive utility for distinguishing disease courses in MDD patients.","Frassle, S.; Marquand, A.

There is a need for validated measures of body composition that can be implemented in routine clinical workflow. Objective: To validate the use of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) for body composition analysis and diagnosis of sarcopenia in head and neck cancer patients. Design: In this prospective observational cohort study, baseline 50 patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiation therapy (RT) were enrolled between February 2016 and March 2017. Baseline BIA measures of skeletal muscle (SM) mass, fat-free mass (FMM), and fat mass (FM) were compared to CT-based estimates of body composition using linear regression. Sex-specific BIA-derived thresholds for sarcopenia were defined by the maximum Youden Index on receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves of BIA against CT-defined sarcopenia. Changes in body composition across treatment were compared against changes in body weight using linear regression. Participants: In total, 50 patients with pathologically confirmed stage I to IVB non-metastatic head and neck cancer treated with definitive radiation therapy were enrolled. Setting: Single academic referral center. Main Outcome and Measure: The primary outcome was relative agreement between baseline lean body mass and fat body mass predicted from BIA measurement and CT imaging. Results: Of the 48 evaluable patients 16 (33.3%) were sarcopenic at baseline based on CT analysis. BIA measures of body composition were strongly correlated with CT measures: SM mass (r = 0.97; R2 = 0.94; p < 0.0001), FFM (r = 0.97; R2 = 0.94; p < 0.0001) and FM (r = 0.95; R2 = 0.90; p < 0.0001). Relationship with normalized indices of SM mass, FFM, and FM was similar between BIA and CT, but not BIA and body mass index (BMI). Patients lost a mean of 5.7 +/- 5.8 kg during treatment, of which 1.5 +/- 1.9 kg was SM, 2.6 +/- 3.3 kg was FFM, and 2.2 +/- 2.6 kg was FM. Eight additional patients developed sarcopenia by the end of RT. Conclusions: BIA provides accurate estimates of body composition in head and neck cancer patients. Implementation of BIA in clinical practice may identify patients with sarcopenia. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02615275","Grossberg, A.; Rock, C.

368,"Investigating the clinico-anatomical dissociation in the behavioral variant of Alzheimer's disease","Objective: We previously found temporoparietal ""Alzheimer-typical"" atrophy in patients with the behavioral variant of Alzheimer's disease (bvAD) with relative sparing of frontal regions. Here, we aimed to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of bvAD based on alternative neuroimaging markers. Methods: We retrospectively included 150 participants at the University of California San Francisco and University of Berkeley, including 29 bvAD, 28 ""typical"" amnestic-predominant AD (tAD), 28 behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), and 65 cognitively normal participants. Patients with bvAD were compared with other groups on glucose metabolism and metabolic connectivity on [18F]FDG-PET, and subcortical gray matter volumes and white matter hyperintensity volumes (WMHV) on MRI. A receiver-operating-characteristic-analysis was performed to determine the measures yielding the highest contrast between groups. Results: bvAD and tAD showed predominant temporoparietal hypometabolism compared to controls, and did not differ in direct contrasts. However, overlaying statistical maps from contrasts between patients and controls revealed broader frontoinsular hypometabolism in bvAD compared to tAD, partially overlapping with bvFTD. Metabolic connectivity analyses indicated greater anterior default mode network (DMN) involvement in bvAD compared to tAD, mimicking bvFTD. Analyses of subcortical volume and WMHV showed no relevant group differences. The top-3 discriminative measures for bvAD vs. bvFTD were: metabolism in posterior (bvAD<bvFTD), anterior DMN (bvAD>bvFTD) and parietal cortex (bvAD<bvFTD; AUC: 0.80-0.91, p<0.01), while the top-3 discriminators for bvAD vs. tAD were amygdalar volume (bvAD>tAD), anterior DMN (bvAD<tAD) and salience network metabolism (bvAD<tAD; AUC: 0.66-0.75, p<0.05). Conclusion: Subtle frontoinsular hypometabolism and anterior DMN involvement may underlie the prominent behavioral phenotype in bvAD.","Singleton, E. H.; Pijnenburg, Y. A. L.; Sudre, C.

388,"Neuropsychological stratification of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: building affect into clinically relevant neuro-biomarkers of breathlessness","Background: Chronic breathlessness profoundly affects quality of life for its sufferers. Often, reported breathlessness is inconsistent with airway pathophysiology and objective disease markers. While a mechanistic understanding of this discordance has thus far remained elusive, factors such as mood, attention and expectation have all been implicated as important perceptual modulators. Therefore, here we have developed a model capable of exploring these relationships aiding patient stratification and revealing clinically-relevant neuro-biomarkers. Methods: A cohort of 100 participants with mild-to-moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) underwent a comprehensive assessment that included functional brain imaging while viewing and rating breathlessness-related word cues, self-report questionnaires and clinical measures. Results: Using an exploratory factor analysis across psychological and physiological measures, we identified two distinctive neuropsychological behavioural profiles that differed across four key factors corresponding to mood, symptom burden, and two capability measures. These profiles stratified participants into high and low symptom groups, which did not differ in spirometry values. The low symptom load group demonstrated greater FMRI activity to breathlessness-related word cues in the anterior insula. Conclusions: Our findings reveal two clear groups of individuals within our COPD cohort, divided by behavioural rather than clinical factors. Furthermore, indices of depression, anxiety, vigilance and perceived capability were linked to differences in brain activity within key regions thought to be involved in monitoring bodily sensations (interoception). These findings demonstrate the complex relationship between affect and interoceptive processing, providing the foundations for the development of targeted treatment programmes that harness clinical and symptom-relevant biomarkers.","Finnegan, S.

625,"Family history and polygenic risk of cardiovascular disease: independent factors associated with secondary cardiovascular manifestations in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy","Background Family history (FHx) of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a risk factor for CVD and a proxy for cardiovascular heritability. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) summarizing >1 million variants for coronary artery disease (CAD) are associated with incident and recurrent CAD events. However, little is known about the influence of FHx or PRS on secondary cardiovascular events (sCVE) in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Methods We included 1,788 CEA patients from the Athero-Express Biobank. A weighted PRS for CAD including 1.7 million variants was calculated (MetaGRS). The composite endpoint of sCVE during three years follow-up included coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral events and cardiovascular death. We assessed the impact of FHx and MetaGRS on sCVE and carotid plaque composition. Results Positive FHx was associated with a higher 3-year risk of sCVE independent of cardiovascular risk factors and MetaGRS (adjusted HR 1.40, 95%CI 1.07-1.82, p=0.013). Patients in the highest MetaGRS quintile had a higher 3-year risk of sCVE compared to the rest of the cohort independent of cardiovascular risk factors including FHx (adjusted HR 1.35, 95%CI 1.01-1.79, p=0.043), and their atherosclerotic plaques contained more fat (adjusted OR 1.59, 95%CI, 1.11-2.29, p=0.013) and more macrophages (OR 1.49, 95%CI 1.12-1.99, p=0.006). Conclusion In CEA patients, both positive FHx and higher MetaGRS were independently associated with increased risk of sCVE. Moreover, higher MetaGRS was associated with vulnerable plaque characteristics. Future studies should unravel underlying mechanisms and focus on the added value of PRS and FHx in individual risk prediction for sCVE.","Timmerman, N.; De Kleijn, D. P. V.; De Borst, G.

521,"Plasma proteomics reveals markers of metabolic stress in HIV infected children with severe acute malnutrition: call for more evidence-based nutritional intervention strategies","HIV infection affects up to 30% of children presenting with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in Africa and is associated with increased mortality. Children with SAM are treated similarly regardless of the presence of HIV although mechanisms of nutritional recovery in HIV and/or SAM are not well understood. We aimed to test the hypothesis that metabolic and inflammatory perturbations among children with SAM differed between those with HIV (n = 54) and without HIV (n = 113) to better understand their specific nutritional and therapeutic requirements. We performed a secondary analysis of a clinical trial and plasma proteomics data among children with complicated SAM in Kenya and Malawi. Compared to children with SAM without HIV, HIV-infected children had evidence (false discovery rate corrected p<0.05) of metabolic stress, including enriched pathways related to inflammation and lipid metabolism. Moreover, we observed reduced plasma levels of zinc--2-glycoprotrein, butyrylcholinesterase, and increased levels of complement C2 resembling findings in metabolic syndrome, diabetes and other non-communicable diseases. HIV was also associated (false discovery rate corrected p<0.05) with higher levels of plasma chemokines: MCP1, CCL4, GCSF, IL1b, TNFa, IL-2, 5, 7, 8 and 15, IL12p40, IP-10, and IL-1RA. Considering evidence of biomarkers of metabolic stress in children with HIV and SAM, it is of potential concern that our current treatment strategy for SAM regardless of HIV status involves a high-fat therapeutic diet. The results of this study indicate a need for clinical trials of therapeutic foods that meet the specific metabolic needs of children with HIV and SAM.","Gonzales, G. B.; Njunge, J. M.; Gichuki, B.

348,"Correlates of better linear growth among children in sub-Saharan Africa: Cross sectional survey analysis of positive deviants in poor households","Objectives: To examine the sociodemographic correlates associated with better linear growth among children under 5 years living in poor households Design: Cross-sectional Setting: Ghana, Kenya, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Nigeria and Mozambique Participants: Singleton children aged 0 to 59 months, born to mothers aged 15 to 49 years. Information on children was obtained through face-to-face interviews with mothers. Primary outcome measure: Child height-for-age Z-scores (HAZ), categorised into HAZ[&ge;]-2 standard deviations (SD) (better growth/not stunted) and HAZ[&le;]-2 SD (stunted/poor growth). Results: A unit change in maternal years of education was associated with increased odds of better growth among children living in poor households in DRC [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)= 1.03, 95% CI=1.01,1.07)], Ghana (aOR=1.06, 95% CI=1.01,1.11), Kenya (aOR=1.03, 95% CI= 1.01, 1.05) and Nigeria (aOR=1.08, 95%=1.06,1.10). Maternal antenatal attendance of at least four visits was associated positively with better child growth in DRC (aOR=1.32, 95% CI=1.05, 1.67) and Ghana (aOR=1.67, 95% CI=1.19, 2.33). The association did not reach statistical significance in the remaining three countries. In Ghana, Mozambique and DRC, breastfeeding was associated significantly with the likelihood of better linear growth when only socio-demographic correlates were included in the models, but disappeared after the inclusion of child level covariates. In Nigeria, maternal normal weight was associated with increased odds (aOR=1.24, 95% CI=1.08, 1.43) of better growth among children living in poor households, so was overweight (aOR=1.51, 95% CI= 1.24, 1.83). In all the countries except Ghana, child biological factors such as sex and age were associated with reduced odds of better linear growth. Conclusions: The socio-demographic factors included in this analysis have the potential to promote linear growth of children under 5 years living in poor households. Interventions aimed at promoting linear growth among children living in poverty should target at enhancing these factors.

356,"Bi-directional effects between loneliness and substance use: Evidence from a Mendelian randomisation study","Aims: Loneliness and social isolation are associated with cigarette smoking and problematic alcohol use. Observational evidence suggests these associations arise because loneliness increases substance use, however there is potential for reverse causation (problematic drinking causing damage to social networks, leading to loneliness). With conventional epidemiological methods, controlling for (residual) confounding and reverse causality is difficult. In this study, we apply Mendelian randomisation (MR) to assess bi-directional causal effects between loneliness on the one hand and smoking behaviour and alcohol (ab)use on the other. Design: We applied bi-directional MR using summary-level data of the largest available genome-wide association studies of loneliness (n=511,280), smoking (initiation (n=249,171), cigarettes-per-day (n=249,171) and cessation (n=143,852)), alcoholic drinks-per-week (n=226,223) and alcohol dependence (n=46,568), using independent samples. For each relationship, we selected genetic variants predictive of the exposure variable as instruments and tested their association with the outcome variable. Effect estimates for individual variants were combined with inverse-variance weighted regression (gene-outcome/gene-exposure association) and the robustness of these findings was assessed with five different sensitivity methods. Findings: There was weak evidence of increased loneliness leading to higher likelihood of initiating smoking and smoking more cigarettes, and a lower likelihood of quitting smoking. Additionally, there was evidence that initiating smoking increases loneliness. We found no evidence of a causal effect between loneliness and alcohol (ab)use. Conclusions: We report tentative evidence for causal, bidirectional, increasing effects between loneliness and cigarette smoking. These findings improve our understanding of the interrelatedness of smoking and loneliness, however, replication with better powered genetic instruments is recommended.","Wootton, R.

407,"Hidden heterogeneity and its influence on dengue vaccination impact","The CYD-TDV vaccine was recently developed to combat dengue, a mosquito-borne viral disease that afflicts millions of people each year throughout the tropical and subtropical world. Its rollout has been complicated by recent findings that vaccinees with no prior exposure to dengue virus (DENV) experience an elevated risk of severe disease in response to their first DENV infection subsequent to vaccination. As a result of these findings, guidelines for use of CYD-TDV now require serological screening prior to vaccination to establish that an individual does not fall into this high-risk category. These complications mean that the public health impact of CYD-TDV vaccination is expected to be higher in areas with higher transmission. One important practical difficulty with tailoring vaccination policy to local transmission contexts is that DENV transmission is spatially heterogeneous, even at the scale of neighborhoods or blocks within a city. This raises the question of whether models based on data that average over spatial heterogeneity in transmission could fail to capture important aspects of CYD-TDV impact in spatially heterogeneous populations. We explored this question with a deterministic model of DENV transmission and CYD-TDV vaccination in a population comprised of two communities with differing transmission intensities. Compared to the full model, a version of the model based on the average of the two communities failed to capture benefits of targeting the intervention to the high-transmission community, which resulted in greater impact in both communities than we observed under even coverage. In addition, the model based on the average of the two communities substantially overestimated impact among vaccinated individuals in the low-transmission community. In the event that the specificity of serological screening is not high, this result suggests that models that ignore spatial heterogeneity could overlook the potential for harm to this segment of the population.","Walters, M.

353,"Plasminogenuria is associated with podocyte injury, edema, and kidney dysfunction in incident glomerular disease","Urinary plasminogen/plasmin, or plasmin(ogen)uria, has been demonstrated in proteinuric patients and exposure of cultured podocytes to plasminogen results in injury via oxidative stress pathways. A causative role for plasmin(ogen) as a ""second hit"" in kidney disease progression has yet to be demonstrated in vivo, and the association between plasmin(ogen)uria and kidney function in glomerular diseases remains unclear. We performed comparative studies in a puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) nephropathy rat model treated with amiloride, an inhibitor of plasminogen activation, and measured changes in plasmin(ogen)uria and urinary endothelin-1 (ET1). In a glomerular disease biorepository cohort (n=128), we measured time-of- biopsy albuminuria, proteinuria, and plasmin(ogen)uria for correlations with renal outcomes. Increased glomerular plasmin(ogen) was found in PAN rats and FSGS patients. PAN nephropathy was associated with increases in plasmin(ogen)uria, proteinuria, and urinary ET1. Amiloride was protective against PAN- induced glomerular injury, reducing urinary ET1 and oxidative stress. In patients, we found associations between plasmin(ogen)uria and edema status as well as eGFR. Our study demonstrates a role for plasmin(ogen)-induced podocyte injury in the PAN nephropathy model, with amiloride having podocyte- protective properties. In one of largest glomerular disease cohorts to study plasminogen, we validated previous findings while suggesting a potentially novel relationship between plasmin(ogen)uria and eGFR. Together, these findings suggest a role for plasmin(ogen) in mediating glomerular injury and as a viable targetable biomarker for podocyte-sparing treatments.","Egerman, M. A.; Wong, J.

Bibliometric data of the top 5% of CSR were extracted from the Web of Science. Keyword co-occurrence, co-authorship, and co-citation network analysis were then employed using VOSviewer software. A Random forest model was used to analyze the citation patterns. A total of 12016 CSR with AAS were found (Total mentions: 259968) with Twitter being the most popular Altmetric resource. Consequently, the top 5% (607 articles, mean AAS: 171.2, 95% confidence level (CL): 14.4, mean citations: 42.1, 95%CL: 1.3) with the highest AAS were included in the study.

Differences in risk factor distributions and associations by age at diagnosis and ER status may explain this disparity. Methods We analyzed data from 1,126 women (aged 18 to 74 years) with invasive breast cancer and 2,106 population controls recruited from three hospitals in Ghana from 2013 to 2015. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for menstrual and reproductive factors using polytomous logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders. Results Among controls, medians for age at menarche, parity, age at first birth, and breastfeeding/pregnancy were 15 years, 4 births, 20 years, and 18 months, respectively. For women greater or equal to 50 years, parity and extended breastfeeding were associated with decreased risks: >5 births vs. nulliparous, OR 0.40 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.83) and 0.71 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.98) for greater or equal to 19 vs. <13 breastfeeding months/pregnancy, which did not differ by ER. In contrast, for earlier onset cases (<50 years) parity was associated with increased risk for ER-negative tumors (Pheterogeneity by ER = 0.02), which was offset by extended breastfeeding. Similar associations were observed by intrinsic-like subtypes. Less consistent relationships were observed with ages at menarche and first birth. Conclusion Reproductive risk factor distributions are different from European populations but exhibited etiologic heterogeneity by age at diagnosis and ER status similar to other populations.","Figueroa, J.

505,"Machine learning prediction of motor response after deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease","Introduction: Despite careful patient selection for subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS), some Parkinson's disease patients show limited improvement of motor disability. Non-conclusive results from previous prediction studies maintain the need for a simple tool for neurologists that reliably predicts postoperative motor response for individual patients. Establishing such a prediction tool facilitates the clinician to improve patient counselling, expectation management, and postoperative patient satisfaction. Predictive machine learning models can be used to generate individual outcome predictions instead of correlating pre- and postoperative variables on a group level. Methods: We developed a machine learning logistic regression prediction model which generates probabilities for experiencing weak motor response one year after surgery. The model analyses preoperative variables and is trained on 90 patients using a ten-fold cross-validation. We intentionally chose to leave out pre-, intra- and postoperative imaging and neurophysiology data, to ensure the usability in clinical practice. Weak responders (n = 27) were defined as patients who fail to show clinically relevant improvement on Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) II, III or IV. Results: The model predicts weak responders with an average area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic of 0.88 (standard deviation: 0.14), a true positive rate of 0.85 and a false positive rate of 0.25, and a diagnostic accuracy of 78%. The reported influences of the individual preoperative variables are useful for clinical interpretation of the model, but cannot been interpreted separately regardless of the other variables in the model. Conclusion: The very good diagnostic accuracy of the presented prediction model confirms the utility of machine-learning based motor response prediction one year after STN DBS implantation, based on clinical preoperative variables. After reproduction and validation in a prospective cohort, this prediction model holds a tremendous potential to be a supportive tool for clinicians during the preoperative counseling.","Habets, J.

350,"Secrets of the hospital underbelly: abundance of antimicrobial resistance genes in hospital wastewater reflects hospital antimicrobial use and inpatient length of stay","Introduction Hospital wastewater is a potential major source of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This study uses metagenomics to ask how abundances of AMR genes in hospital wastewater are related to clinical activity. Methods Sewage was collected over a 24-hour period from multiple wastewater collection points representing different specialties within a tertiary hospital site and simultaneously from community sewage works. High throughput shotgun sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq4000. AMR gene abundances were correlated to hospital antimicrobial usage (AMU), data on clinical activity and resistance prevalence in clinical isolates. Findings Microbiota and AMR gene composition varied between each collection point and overall AMR gene abundance was higher in hospital wastewater than in community influent. The composition of AMR genes correlated with microbiota composition (Procrustes analysis, p=0.002). Increased antimicrobial consumption at a class level was associated with higher AMR gene abundance within that class in wastewater (incidence rate ratio 2.80, C.I. 1.2-6.5, p=0.016). Prolonged average patient length of stay was associated with higher total AMR gene abundance in wastewater (incidence rate ratio 2.05, C.I. 1.39-3.01, p=0.0003). AMR gene abundance at a class level within hospital wastewater did not reflect resistance patterns in the 181 clinical isolates grown from hospital inpatients over the time of wastewater sampling. Conclusions Hospital antimicrobial consumption and patient length of stay are important drivers of AMR gene outflow into the environment. Using metagenomics to identify the full range of AMR genes in hospital wastewater could represent a useful surveillance tool to monitor hospital AMR gene outflow and guide environmental policy on AMR.","Perry, M.; Van Bunnik, B.; Mcnally, L.; Wee, B.; Munk, P.; Warr, A.; Moore, B.; Kalima, P.; Philip, C.; De Roda Husman, A.

354,"Noise-Assisted MEMD-Based Phase-Connectivity Analysis to Personalize Closed-Loop DBS Therapy in Epilepsy Patients","Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a treatment that has been explored for controlling seizures in patients with intractable epilepsy. Many clinical and pre-clinical studies using DBS therapy determine stimulation parameters through trial and error. The same stimulation parameters are often applied to the whole cohort, which consequently produces mixed results of responders and non-responders. In this paper, an adaptive non-linear analytical methodology is proposed to extract stimulation frequency and location(s) from endogenous brain dynamics of epilepsy patients, using phase-synchrony and phase-connectivity analysis, as seizures evolve. The proposed analytical method was applied to seizures recorded using depth electrodes implanted in hippocampus and amygdala in three patients. A reduction in phase-synchrony was observed in all patients around seizure onset. However, phase-synchrony started to gradually increase from mid-ictal and achieved its maximum level at seizure termination. This result suggests that hyper-synchronization of the epileptic network may be a crucial mechanism by which the brain naturally terminates seizure. Stimulation frequency and locations that matched the network phase-synchrony at seizure termination were extracted using phase-connectivity analysis. One patient with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) had a stimulation frequency ~15 Hz with the stimulation locations confined to the hippocampus. The other two patients with extra-temporal lobe epilepsy (ETE) had stimulation frequency ~90 Hz with at least one stimulation location outside of hippocampus. These results suggest that DBS parameters should vary based on the patient's underlying pathology. The proposed methodology provides an algorithm for tuning DBS parameters for individual patients in an effort to increase the clinical efficacy of the therapy.","Farahmand, S.; Sobayo, T.; Mogul, D.

355,"Does Pecs II Block Reduce the Incidence of Post Mastectomy Pain Syndrome (PMPS)? A Cross Sectional Study","Background and Objectives: Post mastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS) is a chronic pain condition that develops after breast cancer surgery. The objective of this study was to determine if Pecs II block administered prior to general anesthesia (GA) reduced the incidence of PMPS after mastectomy and axillary clearance (MAC) when compared with conventional analgesic therapy. Methods: This cross sectional study compared incidence and severity of PMPS in 288 women who underwent unilateral MAC. Questionnaire survey was done via personal and telephone interview with 145 patients who received conventional analgesic therapy versus 143 patients who received Pecs II block. Outcomes assessed included incidence, severity and chronic pain symptom and sign score of PMPS. Results: We found a significantly lower incidence of PMPS in patients who received Pecs II block compared with conventional analgesic therapy [49.7% vs. 63.4%, OR 0.57 (0.36-0.91), P = 0.018], which was a 22% relative risk reduction (RR 0.78). Severity of PMPS in Pecs II group was also significantly reduced as shown by lower static and dynamic pain scores at operative site (P < 0.001). Furthermore, Pecs II group reported significantly lower Chronic Pain Symptom and Sign Score (P = 0.002) compared to conventional group. Conclusions: Pecs II block prior to MAC significantly reduced the incidence of PMPS, severity of chronic pain at operative site and number of chronic pain symptoms and signs related to PMPS.","Yeoh, C.

566,"Resilience to dominant genetic disease in the healthy elderly","Here we describe genomic screening of the healthy elderly to identify those resilient to adult-onset genetic disease, despite being at exceptionally high genetic risk. We sequenced 13,131 individuals aged 70 or older (mean age 75 years) from the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) trial. Participants had no prior history of cardiovascular disease, life-threatening cancer, persistent physical disability or dementia. We compared the prevalence of pathogenic variants in medically actionable autosomal dominant disease genes with that from the UK Biobank population, and assessed their clinical impact using personal medical history and adjudicated study outcomes during 4.5 years of follow-up. The frequency of pathogenic variants was less than reported among the younger UK Biobank population, suggesting these variants confer a survival disadvantage during the middle years of life. Yet we identified 141 individuals with pathogenic variants free of any associated disease up to average age 79.5 years. Further study of these elderly resilient individuals might help uncover genetic mechanisms that protect against the development of disease.","Lacaze, P.; Sebra, R.; Riaz, M.; Tiller, J.; Revote, J.; Phung, J.; Parker, E.

396,"Estimates of the global burden of Japanese Encephalitis and the impact of vaccination from 2000-2015","Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a mosquito-borne disease, known for its high death and disability rate among symptomatic cases. Many effective vaccines are available for JE, and the use of a recently developed and inexpensive vaccine has been increasing over the recent years particularly with Gavi support. Estimates of the local burden and the past impact of vaccination are therefore increasingly needed, but difficult due to the limitations of JE surveillance. In this study, we implemented a mathematical modelling method combined with age-stratifed case data which can overcome some of these limitations. We estimate in 2015 JE infections caused 100,308 cases (95%CI: 61,720 - 157,522) and 25,125 deaths (95%CI: 14,550 - 46,031), and that between 2000 and 2015 307,774 JE cases (95%CI: 167,442- 509,583) were averted due to vaccination. Our results highlight areas that could have the greatest benefit from starting vaccination or from scaling up existing programs and will be of use to support local and international policymakers in making vaccine allocation decisions.","Quan, T.

502,"Using Hierarchical Clustering to Explore Patterns of Deprivation Among English Local Authorities","Background The English Indices of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) is widely used as a measure of deprivation of geographic areas in analyses of health inequalities between places. However, similarly ranked areas can differ substantially in the underlying domains and indicators that are used to calculate the IMD score. These subdomains and indicators contain a richer set of data that might be useful for classifying local authorities. Clustering methods offer a set of techniques to identify groups of areas with similar patterns of deprivation. This could offer insights into areas that face similar challenges. Methods Hierarchical agglomerative (i.e. bottom-up) clustering methods were applied to domain scores for 152 upper-tier local authorities. Recent advances in statistical testing allow clusters to be identified that are unlikely to have arisen from random partitioning of a homogeneous group. The resulting clusters are described in terms of their subdomain scores and basic geographic and demographic characteristics. Results Five statistically significant clusters of local authorities were identified. These clusters represented local authorities that were: (i) Most deprived, predominantly urban; (ii) Least deprived, predominantly rural; (iii) Less deprived, rural; (iv) Deprived, high crime, high barriers to housing; and (v) Deprived, low education, poor employment, poor health. Conclusion Hierarchical clustering methods identify five distinct clusters that do not correspond closely to quintiles of deprivation. These methods can be used to draw on the richer set of information contained in the IMD subdomains and may help to identify places that face similar challenges, and places that appear similar in terms of IMD scores, but that face different challenges.","Senior, S.

392,"Epigenomic prediction of cardiovascular disease risk and interactions with traditional risk metrics","Epigenome-wide association studies for cardiometabolic risk factors have discovered multiple loci associated with incident cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, few studies have sought to directly optimize a predictor of CVD risk. Furthermore, it is challenging to train multivariate models across multiple studies in the presence of study- or batch effects. Here, we analyzed existing DNA methylation data collected using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 microarray to create a predictor of CVD risk across three cohorts: Women's Health Initiative, Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort, and Lothian Birth Cohorts. We trained Cox proportional hazards-based elastic net regressions for incident CVD separately in each cohort, and used a recently-introduced cross-study learning approach to integrate these individual predictions into an ensemble predictor. The methylation-based risk score (MRS) predicted CVD time-to-event in a held-out fraction of the Framingham dataset (HR per SD = 1.28, p = 2e-3) and predicted myocardial infarction status in the independent REGICOR dataset (OR per SD = 2.14, p = 9e-7). These associations remained after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and were similar to those from elastic net models trained on a directly merged dataset. Additionally, we investigated interactions between the MRS and both genetic and biochemical CVD risk, showing preliminary evidence of an enhanced predictive power in those with less traditional risk factor elevation. This investigation provides proof-of-concept for a genome-wide, CVD-specific epigenomic risk score and suggests that the DNA methylation data may enable the discovery of high-risk individuals that would be missed by alternative risk metrics.","Westerman, K.; Fernandez-Sanles, A.; Patil, P.; Sebastiani, P.; Jacques, P.; Starr, J.

474,"Does e-cigarette use in non-smoking young adults act as a gateway to smoking? A systematic review and meta-analysis","Objective: The aim of this review was to investigate whether e-cigarette use compared to non-use in young non-smokers is associated with subsequent cigarette smoking. Data sources: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Wiley Cochrane Library databases, and the 2018 Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco and Society for Behavioural Medicine conference abstracts. Study selection: All studies of young people (up to age 30 years) with a measure of e-cigarette use prior to smoking and an outcome measure of smoking where an odds ratio could be calculated were included (excluding reviews and animal studies). Data Extraction: Independent extraction was completed by multiple authors using a pre-prepared extraction form. Data synthesis: Of 9,199 results, 17 studies were included in the meta-analysis. There was strong evidence for an association between e-cigarette use among non-smokers and later smoking (OR 4.59, 95% CI 3.60 to 5.85) when the results were meta-analysed in a random effects model. However, there was high heterogeneity (I2 = 88%). Conclusions: Whilst the association between e-cigarette use among non-smokers and subsequent smoking appears strong, the available evidence is limited by the reliance on self-report measures of smoking history without biochemical verification. None of the studies included negative controls which would provide stronger evidence for whether the association may be causal. Much of the evidence also failed to consider the nicotine content of e-liquids used by non-smokers meaning it is difficult to make conclusions about whether nicotine is the mechanism driving this association.","Khouja, J.

596,"Examining the effect of smoking on suicidal ideation and attempts: A triangulation of epidemiological approaches","Background: Previous literature has demonstrated a strong association between cigarette smoking and suicide-related behaviours, characterised as ideation, plans, attempts and suicide related death. This association has not previously been examined in a causal inference framework and has important implications for suicide prevention strategies. Aims: We aimed to examine the evidence for an association between smoking behaviours (initiation, smoking status, heaviness, lifetime smoking) and suicidal thoughts or attempts by triangulating across observational and Mendelian randomisation (MR) analyses. Methods: First, in the UK Biobank, we calculate observed associations between smoking behaviours and suicidal thoughts or attempts. Second, we used Mendelian randomisation (MR) to explore the relationship between smoking and suicide using genetic variants as instruments to reduce bias from residual confounding and reverse causation. Results: Our observational analysis showed a relationship between smoking behaviour and suicidal behaviour, particularly between smoking initiation and suicidal attempts (OR = 2.07, 95% CI = 1.91 to 2.26, p<0.001). The MR analysis and single SNP analysis, however, did not support this. Despite past literature showing a positive dose-response relationship our results showed no clear evidence for a causal effect of smoking on suicidal behaviours. Conclusion: This was the first MR study to explore the effect of smoking on suicidal behaviours. Our results suggest that, despite observed associations, there is no strong evidence for a causal effect of smoking behaviour on suicidal behaviour. Our evidence suggests that further research is needed into alternative risk factors for suicide which might make better intervention targets.","Harrison, R.; Munafo, M.

450,"A validation of machine learning-based risk scores in the prehospital setting","Background: The triage of patients in pre-hospital care is a difficult task, and improved risk assessment tools are needed both at the dispatch center and on the ambulance to differentiate between low- and high-risk patients. This study develops and validates a machine learning-based approach to predicting hospital outcomes based on routinely collected prehospital data. Methods: Dispatch, ambulance, and hospital data were collected in one Swedish region from 2016 to 2017. Dispatch center and ambulance records were used to develop gradient boosting models predicting hospital admission, critical care (defined as admission to an intensive care unit or in-hospital mortality), and two-day mortality. Model predictions were used to generate composite risk scores which were compared to National Early Warning System (NEWS) scores and actual dispatched priorities in a similar but prospectively gathered dataset from 2018. Results: A total of 38203 patients were included from 2016-2018. Concordance indexes (or area under the receiver operating characteristics curve) for dispatched priorities ranged from 0.51 to 0.66, while those for NEWS scores ranged from 0.66 to 0.85. Concordance ranged from 0.71 to 0.80 for risk scores based only on dispatch data, and 0.79 to 0.89 for risk scores including ambulance data. Dispatch data-based risk scores consistently outperformed dispatched priorities in predicting hospital outcomes, while models including ambulance data also consistently outperformed NEWS scores. Model performance in the prospective test dataset was similar to that found using cross-validation, and calibration was comparable to that of NEWS scores.","Spangler, D.

359,"GWAS including 82,707 subjects identifies functional coding variant in OPRM1 gene associated with opioid use disorder","One way to address the current crisis in opioid use is to improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms of opioid use disorder (OUD). We completed a primary GWAS of electronic health record-defined OUD in European-ancestry participants in the Million Veteran Program (MVP) sample, which included 8,529 affected subjects and 71,200 opioid-exposed controls. In the MVP alone, there were no genome-wide significant (GWS) associations. We then subjected the MVP and additional OUD GWAS results from the Yale-Penn and SAGE samples to meta-analysis (in total, 10,544 OUD cases and 72,163 opioid-exposed controls). A functional coding variant (rs1799971, encoding Asn40Asp) in OPRM1 (mu opioid receptor gene, the main biological target for opioid drugs) reached GWS (p=1.51x10-8); then replicated in two independent samples (each at p<0.05). The final meta-analyzed p-value for this variant in all samples was 7.81x10-10. SNP-based heritability of OUD was 11.3%. OUD was genetically correlated with 83 traits, including multiple substance use traits, psychiatric illnesses, cognitive performance, and others. Mendelian Randomization revealed possible causal effects on OUD risk from tobacco smoking, major depression, neuroticism, and cognitive performance. Despite the inclusion of data from the MVP, discovery of a significant association depended on including other purpose-collected samples as well. Recruitment of additional opioid dependent subjects for future studies - especially of non-European ancestry - is a crucial next step.","Zhou, H.; Rentsch, C. T.; Cheng, Z.; Kember, R. L.; Nunez, Y.

Analyses were repeated stratifying by use of orphan designation and use of special regulatory programs. Results: There were 273 novel therapeutics approved by the FDA in these 3 periods (107 in 1995-1997, 57 in 2005-2007, 109 in 2015-2017), representing 339 indications (157, 64, and 118, respectively). Overall, the proportion of indication approvals supported by at least 2 pivotal trials decreased (80.6% in 1995-1997, 60.3% in 2005-2007, 52.8% in 2015-2017; p<0.001). The proportion supported by only single-arm pivotal trials increased (4.0% in 1995-1997, 12.7% in 2005-2007, 17.0% in 2015-2017; p=0.001), as did the proportion supported by at least one pivotal trial of 6 months duration (25.8% in 1995-1997, 34.9% in 2005-2007, 46.2% in 2015-2017; p=0.001). When stratified by use of special regulatory programs, pivotal trial characteristics changed over time in divergent ways, both individually and when aggregated by indication approvals. Conclusion: More recent FDA approvals of novel therapeutics were based on fewer pivotal trials, with less rigorous designs but longer trial durations. These findings reinforce the importance of the FDA's strategy for requiring ongoing evaluation of therapeutic safety and efficacy after approval.","Zhang, A. D.; Puthumana, J.; Downing, N.

464,"Computer-assisted craniometric evaluation for diagnosis and follow-up of craniofacial asymmetries: SymMetric v. 1.0","Purpose: The current assessment of patients with craniofacial asymmetries is accomplished by physical examination, anamnesis and radiological imaging. We propose a semi-automated, computer-assisted craniofacial evaluation (SymMetric v 1.0) based on orthogonal photography of the patient's head in 3 positions. The system is simple, low-cost, no-radiation or special resources needed. Although it does not substitute CT in cases of doubt between craniosynostosis and positional plagiocephaly, multiple numeric evaluations indicate regional deformities and severity of the asymmetry, which can help in the clinical decision of indicating or not the orthosis in positional deformities, determining treatment duration or evaluating surgical outcomes after correction. Methods: A Matlab-based tool was developed for digital processing of photographs taken in 3 positions (anterior, superior and lateral). The software guides the user to select visible and reproducible landmarks in each photograph acquisition and calculates multiple indexes and metrics, generating a set of comprehensive plots to offer the user an overview of head and facial symmetry across the orthogonal views. For purposes of demonstration, we evaluated 2 patients (one control and one with non-sinostotic deformity). Results: The results show a clear differentiation of the control and plagiocephalic patient metrics mainly in the superior view, showing potential for diagnosis of the condition, and also detected the clinical improvement during helmet treatment in the follow-up, 3 and 5 months after orthosis use. Conclusion: We presented a proof-of-concept for a low cost, no radiation evaluation system for craniofacial asymmetries, that can be useful in a clinical context for diagnosis and follow-up of patients.","Alho, E.

364,"A structured approach to evaluating life course hypotheses: Moving beyond analyses of exposed versus unexposed in the omics context","Background: Life course epidemiology provides a framework for studying the effects of time-varying exposures on health outcomes. The structured life course modeling approach (SLCMA) is a theory-driven analytic method that empirically compares multiple prespecified life course hypotheses characterizing time-dependent exposure-outcome relationships to determine which theory best fits the observed data. However, the statistical properties of inference methods used with the SLCMA have not been investigated with high-dimensional omics outcomes. Methods: We performed simulations and empirical analyses to evaluate the performance of the SLCMA when applied to genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm). In the simulations, we compared five statistical inference tests used by SLCMA (n=700). For each, we assessed the familywise error rate (FWER), statistical power, and confidence interval coverage to determine whether inference based on these tests was valid in the presence of substantial multiple testing and small effect sizes, two hallmark challenges of inference from omics data. In the empirical analyses, we applied the SLCMA to evaluate the time-dependent relationship of childhood abuse with genome-wide DNAm (n=703). Results: In the simulations, selective inference and max-|t|-test performed best: both controlled FWER and yielded moderate statistical power. Empirical analyses using SLCMA revealed time-dependent effects of childhood abuse on DNA methylation. Conclusions: Our findings show that SLCMA, applied and interpreted appropriately, can be used in the omics setting to examine time-dependent effects underlying exposure-outcome relationships over the life course. We provide recommendations for applying the SLCMA in high-throughput settings, which we hope will encourage researchers to move beyond analyses of exposed versus unexposed.","Zhu, Y.; Simpkin, A.

428,"Havana Syndrome Among Canadian Diplomats: Brain Imaging Reveals Acquired Neurotoxicity","BACKGROUND: In late 2016, US diplomats stationed in Havana began presenting with a variety of neurological manifestations that proved difficult to diagnose. Though previous studies suggested a likely association with brain injury, the mechanism of injury, brain regions involved, and etiology remained unknown. METHODS: We conducted a multimodal study examining 26 Canadian diplomats and their family members, the majority of whom presented with symptoms similar to their American counterparts while residing in Havana. Assessments included a medical history, self-reported symptom questionnaires, cognitive assessments, blood tests, and brain imaging assessments (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG)). Individuals showing signs of brain injury underwent further neurological, visual, and audio-vestibular assessments. Eight participants were tested both before and after living in Havana. RESULTS: Our assessment documents multiple functional and structural impairments, including significant spatial memory impairment, abnormal brain-stem evoked potentials, degradation of fibre tracts in the fornix and posterior corpus callosum, blood-brain barrier injury to the right basal forebrain and anterior insula, and abnormal paroxysmal slowing events of cortical activity. Subsequent mass-spectrometry and blood analyses documented reduced serum cholinesterase activity and the presence of organophosphates (Temephos) and pyrethroid metabolites (3-phenoxybenzoic acid or 3-BPA). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm brain injury, specify the regions involved, and raise the hypothesis of overexposure to cholinesterase inhibitors as a plausible etiology. If correct, our hypothesis bears public health ramifications (see Discussion) and suggests a course of action for reducing exposure in the future.

375,"STOP-Bang questionnaire should be used in all adults with Down Syndrome to screen for moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea","Abstract Study Objectives To determine the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults with Down syndrome (DS), to investigate factors related to OSA severity and to identify which sleep questionnaire is the most appropriate for the screening of OSA in this population. Methods Cross-sectional study that consecutively included 60 adults with DS. All patients underwent type III polysomnography and clinical and laboratory data were collected; sleep assessment questionnaires were applied. Multiple linear regression models evaluated the associations between OSA severity (measured by the respiratory event index - REI) and clinical and laboratory data and sleep questionnaires (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, BERLIN and STOP-Bang questionnaires). Results Results show that 60 (100%) adults with DS had OSA, with moderate-severe OSA identified in 49 (81.6%). At the multivariate linear regression, REI significantly correlated with hematocrit levels, BMI and STOP-Bang questionnaire (SBQ) results (P <0.001). The positive STOP-Bang [&ge;]3 points) showed 100% of sensitivity (95%CI: 92.75-100%), 45.45% of specificity (95%CI: 16.75-76.62), positive predictive value of 89.09% (95%CI: 82.64-93.34%), negative predictive value of 100%, accuracy of 90% (95%CI: 79.49-96.24%) and OR of 24.29. Conclusions Adults with DS have a very high prevalence of OSA. Hematocrit levels, BMI and SBQ showed a strong correlation with OSA severity. The SBQ performed well in identifying moderate to severe OSA in this population. Considered together, these results point to the need to perform OSA screening in all adults with DS, and STOP-Bang may play a role in this screening.

371,"A rapid review of patient and family perspectives on inappropriateness of intensive care treatments at the end of life","Aim To understand patient/family perspective of inappropriate intensive care unit (ICU) admissions and treatment. Methods Rapid literature review of English language articles published between 2001 and 2017 in Medline or PsycInfo. Results Thirteen articles covering 6,194 elderly patients or surrogate decision-makers from four countries were eligible. Perceived inappropriateness of ICU treatments was mainly expressed as dissatisfaction with clinicians as surrogate decision-makers, inconsistency with patient/family values, family distrust of physicians predictions on poor prognosis, and inadequate communication on over-aggressive treatment causing suffering. Consultation on opinion before ICU admission varied from 1% to 53.6%, and treatment goals from 1.4 to 31.7%. Satisfaction with the decision-making process in ICU was higher for those who had certain level of control and involvement in the process. Conclusions The patient/family perspective on inappropriateness of ICU treatments involves preferences, values and social constructs beyond medical criteria. Earlier consultation with families before ICU admission, and patient education on outcomes of life-sustaining therapies may help reconcile these provider-patient disagreements. Keywords: professional-patient relations, intensive care, end-of-life, review. Take-home message The patient/family perspective on inappropriateness of ICU at the end of life often differs from the clinicians opinion due to the non-medical frame of mind. To improve satisfaction with communication on treatment goals, consultation on patient values and inclusion of social constructs in addition to clinical prediction are a good start to reconcile differences between physician and health service users viewpoint.","Cardona, M.; Shanmugam, S.; Lewis, E.

415,"A metabolite-based machine learning approach to diagnose Alzheimer's-type dementia in blood: Results from the European Medical Information Framework for Alzheimer's Disease biomarker discovery cohort","INTRODUCTION: Machine learning (ML) may harbor the potential to capture the metabolic complexity in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Here we set out to test the performance of metabolites in blood to categorise AD when compared to CSF biomarkers. METHODS: This study analysed samples from 242 cognitively normal (CN) people and 115 with AD-type dementia utilizing plasma metabolites (n=883). Deep Learning (DL), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF) were used to differentiate AD from CN. These models were internally validated using Nested Cross Validation (NCV). RESULTS: On the test data, DL produced the AUC of 0.85 (0.80-0.89), XGBoost produced 0.88 (0.86-0.89) and RF produced 0.85 (0.83-0.87). By comparison, CSF measures of amyloid, p-tau and t-tau (together with age and gender) produced with XGBoost the AUC values of 0.78, 0.83 and 0.87, respectively. DISCUSSION: This study showed that plasma metabolites have the potential to match the AUC of well-established AD CSF biomarkers in a relatively small cohort. Further studies in independent cohorts are needed to validate whether this specific panel of blood metabolites can separate AD from controls, and how specific it is for AD as compared with other neurodegenerative disorders.","Stamate, D.; Kim, M.; Proitsi, P.; Westwood, S.; Baird, A.; Nevado-Holgado, A.; Hye, A.; Bos, I.; Vos, S.; Vandenberghe, R.; Teunissen, C.

377,"Machine learning based prediction of antibiotic sensitivity in patients with critical illness","Rising antibiotic resistance inflicts a heavy burden on healthcare, both clinically and economically. Owing to the time required to obtain culture and sensitivity test results, quite often the clinicians rely on their experience and static clinical guidelines to prescribe antibiotics. Such empirical treatment often fails to account for patient-specific attributes and changes in the antibiotic resistance patterns with time and location. The aim of this study was to analyze the patient and hospital specific features regarding their prognostic relevance to treat bacterial infections of patients in the intensive care units (ICUs). We performed a single-center retrospective cohort analysis across 25526 positive cultures recorded in MIMIC-III critical care database. We retrieved a number of clinically relevant relationships from association analysis between patient factors and bacterial strains. For instance, higher elapsed time from patient admission to sample collection for culture showed strong association with blood stream infection caused by Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus, indicating that these infections are possibly hospital acquired. To predict antibiotic sensitivity at the level of individual patients we developed an ensemble of machine learning algorithms. The model provided superior prediction accuracy (about 87%) and area under the ROC curve (around 0.91 on an average) for the four most common sample types as compared to a number of off-the-shelf techniques. We demonstrate the predictive power of commonly recorded patient attributes in personalised prediction of antibiotic efficacy.","Ghosh, D.; Sharma, S.; Hasan, E.; Ashraf, S.; Singh, V.; Tewari, D.; Singh, S.; Kapoor, M.; Sengupta, D.",20190920,"Infectious Diseases","10.1101/19007153",1,"Debarka Sengupta","Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19007153v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19007153v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"All research has been carried out using publicly available MIMIC critical care database."
376,"A polygenic predictor of treatment-resistant depression using whole exome sequencing and genome-wide genotyping","Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) occurs in ~30% of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) but the genetics of TRD was previously poorly investigated. Whole exome sequencing and genome-wide genotyping were performed in 1320 MDD patients. Response to the first pharmacological treatment was compared to non-response to one treatment and non-response to two or more treatments (TRD). Differences in the risk of carrying damaging variants were tested. A score expressing the burden of variants in genes and pathways was calculated weighting each variant for its functional (Eigen) score and frequency, considering rare variants only and rare + common variants. Gene- and pathway-based scores were used to develop predictive models of TRD and non-response using gradient boosting in 70% of the sample (training) which were tested in the remaining 30% (testing), evaluating also the addition of clinical predictors. Independent replication was tested in STAR*D and GENDEP using exome array-based data. After quality control 1209 subjects were included. TRD and non-responders did not show higher risk to carry damaging variants compared to responders. Genes/pathways associated with TRD included those modulating cell survival and proliferation, neurodegeneration and immune response. Significant prediction of TRD vs. response was observed in the testing sample which was improved by the addition of clinical factors. Some models were replicated, with a weaker prediction, in STAR*D and GENDEP when considering also clinical factors and in the extremes of the genetic score distribution. These results suggested relevant biological mechanisms implicated in TRD and a new methodological approach to the prediction of TRD.","Fabbri, C.; Kasper, S.; Kautzky, A.; Zohar, J.; Montgomery, S.; Albani, D.; Forloni, G.; Ferentinos, P.; Rujescu, D.; Mendlewicz, J.; Uher, R.; Lewis, C.; Serretti, A.",20190920,"Genetic And Genomic Medicine","10.1101/19007161",1,"Alessandro Serretti","University of Bologna","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19007161v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19007161v1.full.pdf","cc_no","10.1038/s41398-020-0738-5","Individual-level data or summary statistics is not publicly available for GSRD and GENDEP, however raw genotypes and phenotypes of these samples are available to Psychiatric Genomic Consortium (PGC) analysts (https://www.med.unc.edu/pgc/) within approved projects.

681,"The day-to-day experiences of caring for children with Osteogenesis Imperfecta: A qualitative descriptive study","Purpose: Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a rare genetic condition known to cause bone fragility. Family caregivers, such as parents, of children with OI play an important role in helping these children live well at home. This study aimed to explore the day-to-day experiences of caregivers who are caring for children with OI. Materials and Methods: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted. Eighteen adult caregivers of children with OI were recruited at a children's hospital in Montreal, Canada to participate in individual interviews. The interviews were transcribed and inductively thematically analysed. Results: The following caregiving themes were identified in these interviews: regular day-to-day caregiving activities, including morning routines, evening routines, and the facilitation of their child's mobilization; periods that made the caregiving routine more challenging, such as fractures, surgeries, and pain; and the long-term strategies caregivers employed to support day-to-day care, such as managing the environment, accessing medical and school resources, and coordinating care and respite. Conclusions: The results showcase what being a caregiver for a child with OI involves on a day-to-day basis. The recommendations include suggestions for future clinical, policy, and research endeavours to better support family caregivers of children with OI.","Castro, A.

431,"A Comparison of the Randomized Clinical Trial Efficacy and Real-World Effectiveness of Tofacitinib for the Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Cohort Study","Background: Real-world data are receiving attention from regulators, biopharmaceuticals and payors as a potential source of clinical evidence. However, the suitability of these data to produce evidence commensurate with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the best practices in their use remain unclear. We sought to compare the real-world effectiveness of Tofacitinib in the treatment of IBD against efficacy rates published by corresponding RCTs. Methods: Electronic health records at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) were queried and reviewed to identify 86 Tofacitinib-treated IBD patients through 4/2019. The primary endpoint was treatment effectiveness. This was measured by time-to-treatment-discontinuation and by the primary endpoints of RCTs in Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD). Endpoints were measured and analyzed following a previously published protocol and analysis plan. Findings: 86 patients (68 with UC, 18 with CD) initiated Tofacitinib for IBD treatment. Most of the data needed to calculate baseline and follow-up disease activity indices were documented within the EHR (77% for UC, 91% for CD). Baseline characteristics of the UCSF and RCT cohorts were similar, except for a longer disease duration and 100% treatment failure of Tumor Necrosis Factor inhibitors in the former. None of the UCSF cohort would have met the RCT eligibility criteria due to multiple reasons. The rate of achieving the RCT primary endpoints were highly similar to the published rates for both UC (16%, P=0.5) and CD (38%, P=0.8). However, treatment persistence was substantially higher: 69% for UC (week 52) and 75% for CD (week 26). Interpretation: An analysis of routinely collected clinical data can reproduce published Tofacitinib efficacy rates, but also indicates far greater treatment durability than suggested by RCTs including possible benefit in CD. These results underscore the value of real-world studies to complement RCTs. Funding: The National Institutes of Health and UCSF Bakar Institute","Rudrapatna, V. A.; Glicksberg, B. S.; Butte, A.

Here, we retrospectively analyzed platelet count changes in neonates requiring inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) pulmonary vasodilation therapy for pulmonary hypertension. There were no clinically significant changes in platelet count upon iNO initiation or during iNO therapy. Unexpectedly, platelet counts increased after iNO cessation. These findings argue against a clinically meaningful untapped pulmonary repository of megakaryocytes and platelets in this context, although acute platelet count increases might be expected after discontinuing iNO in some patients. Further work is needed to clarify the underlying etiology for these observations, and to better delineate the mechanisms for platelet count increases after recovery from lung injury.","Thom, C.

429,"The global burden of pressure ulcers among patients with spinal cord injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","Background: Pressure ulcer one of the common challenging public health problems affecting patient with spinal cord injury is the formation of lesion and ulceration on the skin specially in the bony prominence areas. It has a significant impact to the patient and health care system. Moreover it has psychological physical social burden and decrease the quality of life (QoL) of patients. Despite its serious complications limited evidence is available on the global magnitude of pressure ulcers among patient with spinal cord injury. Hence the objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the global magnitude of pressure ulcers among patient with spinal cord injury. Methods: PubMed Scopus Google Scholar Africa journal online PsycINFO and web-science were systematically searched online to retrieve related articles. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline was followed. The random-effects model was fitted to estimate the summary effect. To investigate heterogeneity across the included studies I2 test was employed. Publication bias was examined using funnel plot and Egger regression test statistic. All statistical analysis was done using STATA version 14 software for windows. Results: Twenty-four studies which comprises of 600 078 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The global pooled magnitude of pressure ulcer among patients with spinal cord injury was 32.36% (95% CI (28.21- 36.51%)). Based on the subgroup analysis, the highest magnitude of pressure ulcer was observed in Africa 41.19% (95% CI: 31.70- 52.18). Conclusion: This systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that about one in three patients with spinal cord injury had pressure ulcers. This implies that the overall global magnitude of pressure ulcer is relatively high. Therefore, policymakers (FMoH) and other concerned bodies need give special attention to reduce the magnitude of pressure ulcers in patient with spinal cord injury.","Shiferaw, W.

390,"Use of consensus term and definition for delayed cerebral ischaemia after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage","Background and purpose: In 2010, a multidisciplinary research group proposed a consensus term and definition for the complication of delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI) following aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). We assessed the use of this term and its definition as an endpoint in observational studies and clinical trials. Methods: Firstly, we performed a MEDLINE abstract search from Jan 2008 to Dec 2017 for observational cohort studies and clinical trials to investigate the used terminology over the years. Next, we studied trends in citations of the original paper citing the consensus definitions since publication in 2010. Results: The number of publications citing the 2010 consensus definitions has steadily increased from 18 in 2011 to 54 in 2017. Between 2010 and 2017, 527 papers were published with delayed cerebral ischemia, or another term to describe the same complication, as an endpoint. However, the term delayed cerebral ischemia was used only in 131/527 (25%) of papers and only 14/81 (17%) of clinical trials/cohort studies published in 2017 cited the consensus definitions when outlining study endpoints. Conclusions: Despite publication of consensus terminology and definitions for DCI in 2010, the majority of cohort studies and clinical trials in patients with SAH are not using these. Researchers and editors should be reminded of the importance of using these consensus terminology and definitions in future studies, which will promote the comparability of results between studies, understand the true impact of an intervention, aggregate results in meta- analyses, and construct guidelines with a high level of evidence.","Rowland, M.

472,"Epidemiology and predictors of repeat positive chlamydia tests: the Brant County cohort, Ontario, Canada","Objectives: Repeat positive tests for chlamydia (CR) may help explain current high rates of chlamydia despite years of screening, partner notification and treatment to reduce sequelae. We wanted to determine the numbers of CRs over time as a proportion of all chlamydia cases, and define the differences in demographic, clinical, behavioural, and public health management indicators, between individuals who have experienced a CR and individuals who experienced a single infection in Brant County, Ontario. Methods: A retrospective cohort was developed using notifiable disease data extracted from the integrated public health system. Cases were laboratory confirmed chlamydia and gonorrhea infections in Brant County between January 1st, 2006 and December 31st, 2015. During the study period, 3,499 chlamydia cases and 475 gonorrhea cases were diagnosed. The total number of individuals with chlamydia in that period was 3,060, including 157 coinfections with gonorrhea. Differences between those with reinfection and those with single infection were evaluated using univariate and multivariate (Cox proportional hazards model) methods. Results: Four hundred and ninety-nine (16.30%) individuals experienced CR 28 days from initial infection; of which 328 (65.73%) occurred within 2 years and 211 (42.28%) within 1 year. The median time to CR was 276 days, consistent with existing Canadian literature. Independent risk factors for CR included being male, 25 years old or younger, and not receiving recommended treatment for initial and/or subsequent infection. Conclusions: These findings suggest that inadequate treatment play a significant role in CR, while accounting for young age and male gender, likely due to untreated sex partners.","Santos, J.; Babayan, A.; Huang, M.; Jolly, A.",20191008,"Infectious Diseases","10.1101/19007278",1,"Ann Jolly","University of Ottawa","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19007278v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19007278v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nd",NA,"The data used in this study are not available for public use, as they contain identifying information including age, sex and dissemination area, as well as case identification numbers.

381,"medExtractR: A medication extraction algorithm for electronic health records using the R programming language","Objective: We developed medExtractR, a natural language processing system to extract medication dose and timing information from clinical notes. Our system facilitates creation of medication-specific research datasets from electronic health records. Materials and Methods: Written using the R programming language, medExtractR combines lexicon dictionaries and regular expression patterns to identify relevant medication information ('drug entities'). The system is designed to extract particular medications of interest, rather than all possible medications mentioned in a clinical note. MedExtractR was developed on notes from Vanderbilt University's Synthetic Derivative, using two medications (tacrolimus and lamotrigine) prescribed with varying complexity, and with a third drug (allopurinol) used for testing generalizability of results. We evaluated medExtractR and compared it to three existing systems: MedEx, MedXN, and CLAMP. Results: On 50 test notes for each development drug and 110 test notes for the additional drug, medExtractR achieved high overall performance (F-measures > 0.95). This exceeded the performance of the three existing systems across all drugs, with the exception of a couple specific entity-level evaluations including dose amount for lamotrigine and allopurinol. Discussion: MedExtractR successfully extracted medication entities for medications of interest. High performance in entity-level extraction tasks provides a strong foundation for developing robust research datasets for pharmacological research. However, its targeted approach provides a narrower scope compared with existing systems. Conclusion: MedExtractR (available as an R package) achieved high performance values in extracting specific medications from clinical text, leading to higher quality research datasets for drug-related studies than some existing general-purpose medication extraction tools.","Weeks, H.

401,"Information and genetic counselling for psychiatric risks in children with rare genomic disorders","Purpose: Genomic medicine has transformed the diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders. Evidence of increased psychiatric comorbidity associated with genomic copy number and single nucleotide variants (CNV and SNV) may not be fully considered when providing genetic counselling. We explored parents' experiences of genetics services and how they obtained information concerning psychiatric manifestations. Methods: Parents of children diagnosed with genomic variants completed an online survey exploring, (i) how they experienced the genetic diagnosis, and (ii) how they acquired information about psychiatric, developmental and physical manifestations. Results: Two-hundred and 86 respondents completed the survey. Thirty percent were unsatisfied with receiving genetic diagnoses. Satisfaction was predicted if communication was by geneticists (p = 0.004); provided face-to-face (p = 0.003); clearly explained (p < 0.001); and accompanied by support (p = 0.017). Parents obtained psychiatric information from non-professional sources more often than developmental ({varphi} 0.26, p < 0.001) and physical manifestations ({varphi} 0.21, p = 0.003), which mostly came from health professionals. Information from support organisations was more helpful than from geneticists (odds ratio [OR] 21.0, 95% CI 5.1 - 86.8, p < 0.001); paediatricians (OR 11.0, 1.4 - 85.2, p = 0.004); and internet sites (OR 15.5, 3.7 - 64.8, p < 0.001). Conclusion: A paucity of professional information about psychiatric risks after genetic diagnosis may impede early diagnosis and intervention for children with high genotypic risks. Planned integration of genomic testing into mainstream services should include genetic counselling training to address the full spectrum of developmental, physical and psychiatric manifestations and timely provision of high-quality information.","Cuthbert, A.; Challenger, A.; Hall, J.; Van Den Bree, M.",20190925,"Genetic And Genomic Medicine","10.1101/19007294",1,"Marianne Van Den Bree","Cardiff University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19007294v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19007294v1.full.pdf","cc_by",NA,"Will individual participant data be available?

493,"Multimorbidity and consultation time: a systematic review","Background: Multimorbidity (MM) is one of the major challenges currently facing health systems at the international level and tends to occupy a considerable part of the daily activity of physicians around the world. It is important to think about the medical approach to dealing with patients with multimorbidity in order to maximize the quality of the services provided by national health services, and thus to secure a better quality of life for these patients. Information about the time spent in a medical consultation with a patient with MM criteria is essential to better organize and deliver healthcare. As far as we know, no previous review has summarized the data relating to how having MM affects the length of the average consultation time. Objective: To review all the experimental observational studies that describe the impact of having MM on the average time of a medical consultation. Methods: This systematic review was performed considering the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analysis. The systematic online searches of the Embase and PubMed databases were undertaken, from January 2000 to August 2018. The studies were independently screened by two reviewers to decide which ones met the inclusion criteria. (Kappa=0.84 and Kappa=0.82). Differing opinions were solved by a third person. This systematic review included people with MM criteria as participants (two or more chronic conditions in the same individual). The type of outcome included was explicitly defined - the length of medical appointments with patients with MM criteria. Any strategies aiming to analyse the impact of MM on the average consultation time were considered. The comparator used was the length of time of medical appointment for patients without MM criteria. Experimental and observational studies were included. Results: Of 85 articles identified, only 1 observational study was included. The study shows that there is a clear trend for patients with MM criteria to have longer consultations than patients without MM criteria (p<0.001). The global quality of this study was considered Satisfactory. Conclusions: It is imperative to study the consultation time spent on patients with MM criteria. Finding a longer consultation time indicates it is important to rethink and adapt GPs lists and time planning to be able to give better medical care to patients with MM by providing agendas that have specific times set aside for these patients and allocating enough time for every task required.","Tadeu, A.

503,"Implementation of a specialist pneumonia intervention nurse service significantly lowers mortality for community acquired pneumonia","Objectives: Evaluate clinical outcomes associated with implementing a specialist pneumonia intervention nursing (SPIN) service, to improve adherence with BTS guidelines for hospitalised community acquired pneumonia (CAP). Design: Retrospective cohort study, comparing periods before (2011-13) and after (2014-16) SPIN service implementation. Setting: Single NHS trust across two hospital sites in Leicester City, England Participants: 13,496 adult (aged [&ge;]16) admissions to hospital with a primary diagnosis of CAP Interventions: The SPIN service was set up in 2013/2014 to provide clinical review of new CAP admissions; assurance of guidelines adherence; delivery of CAP clinical education and clinical follow up after discharge. Main outcome measures: The primary outcomes were proportions of CAP cases receiving antibiotic treatment within 4 hours of admission and change in crude in-hospital mortality rate. Secondary outcomes were adjusted mortality rate and length of stay (LOS). Results: The SPIN service reviewed 38% of CAP admissions in 2014-16. 82% of these admissions received antibiotic treatment in <4 hours (68.5% in the national audit). Compared with the pre-SPIN period, there was a significant reduction in both 30-day (OR=0.77 [0.70-0.85], p<0.0001) and in-hospital mortality (OR=0.66 [0.60-0.73], p<0.0001) after service implementation, with a review by the service having the largest independent 30-day mortality benefit (HR=0.60 [0.53-0.67], p<0.0001). There was no change in LOS (median 6 days). Conclusions: Implementation of a SPIN service improves adherence with BTS guidelines and achieves significant reductions in CAP associated mortality. This enhanced model of care is low cost, highly effective and readily adoptable in secondary care.","Free, R.

391,"Genetics of Unexplained Sudden Cardiac Death in Adult Caucasian and African American Individuals Living in the State of Maryland","Background: Unexplained-sudden cardiac death (SCD) describes SCD with no cause identified after a comprehensive autopsy and toxicologic examination. Genetic testing helps to diagnose inherited cardiac diseases in unexplained-SCD, however, the relationship between pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants of inherited cardiomyopathies and primary electrical disorders (PED) and risk of unexplained-SCD in adults living the United States has never been systematically examined. Methods: We performed sequencing of 29 cardiomyopathy and 39 arrhythmia genes in 413 African-Americans and Caucasians (>18 years-old) who died of unexplained-SCD (median age; 41 years-old, 37% females, 50% African-Americans) and whose hearts were found to have no gross pathological finding upon referral to our institution for pathologic consultation from the State of Maryland Medical Examiner. We examined P/LP variants in these genes to study the association between presence of these variants and unexplained-SCD. Results: 143/413 (34.6%) subjects had variants considered P/LP for cardiomyopathy and/or PED (i.e. Brugada Syndrome (BrS), long QT syndrome (LQTS), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD)). In total, 102 (24.7%) subjects harbored 86 P/LP variants for cardiomyopathies and 60 (14.5%) subjects carried 76 P/LP variants for PED. The following pathogenic variants were identified: 68 P/LP variants for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in 79/413 (19.1%) subjects, 18 P/LP variants for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in 22/413 subjects (5.3%), and 76 P/LP variants in 60/413 (14.5%) for PED. There were greater than 121.0- and 138.5- fold median enrichments (431.4- and 200.0- fold cumulative enrichments) in these cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia variants in victims of unexplained SCD versus the general population, respectively. Among these P/LP positive carriers, combinations of conditions were found, including 14/413 (2.4%) having both HCM and PED variants, and 5/413 (1.2%) with DCM and PED variants. African Americans (AA) and Caucasians were equally likely to harbor P/LP variants (32.7% versus 36.6%, p=0.5), but AA had a higher frequent variants of unknown significance. Conclusions: This study represents the largest examination reported on the association between cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia P/LP genetic variants and unexplained-SCD in adults with no gross abnormality on rigorous pathological examination. Nearly one-third of those with unexplained-SCD were carriers of P/LP variants. Our findings with respect to both the association of unexplained SCD with cardiomyopathy genes and race-specific genetic variants suggest new avenues of study for this poorly understood entity.","Guo, L.; Torii, S.; Fernandez, R.; Braumann, R.

456,"Measuring Total Healthcare Utilization Among Intimate Partner Violence Survivors In Primary Care","Rising health care costs are influenced by health care utilization, which encompasses hospital, ambulatory and non-face-to-face episodes of care. In this study, we created a novel a health care utilization-scoring tool that was used to examine whether one psychosocial factor, intimate partner violence (IPV), leads to higher utilization of health care services when controlling for relevant confounders. We sought to fill gaps about how social and behavioral issues impact utilization, particularly non-face-to-face episodes of care. We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study in 2017 examining patients seen at 11 University-affiliated primary care clinics from January 2015 to December 2016 who were screened for IPV. A total of 31,305 patients were screened, of which 280 screened positive. We controlled for medical complexity by deriving the revised Charlson Comorbidity Index for each patient. We calculated a novel utilization score, which was a weighted sum of hospital, ambulatory and non-face-to-face encounters. Missed appointments were also measured. IPV-positive and IPV-negative patients were similar with respect medical complexity. IPV-positive patients had significantly higher mean utilization scores (54 vs. 40, p<0.001) and more missed appointments (3 vs. 1.3, p<0.001). IPV was associated with increased total utilization (p=0.015), as well as non-face-to-face and ambulatory visits (p=0.025 and p=0.015, respectively) for female patients and was associated with more missed appointments for both males and females (p<.001). These data support more inclusive population-specific interventions focusing on social determinants of health to reduce both face-to-face and non-face-to-face utilization, which may improve health care expenditures, outcomes and provider satisfaction.","Logeais, M.

The objectives of this report were to describe and evaluate the 13th edition of GGPBT including 1) author characteristics; 2) recency of citations; 3) conflict of interest (CoI) disclosure, and 4) expert evaluation of chapters. Methods: Contributors (N = 115) sex, professional degrees, and presence of undisclosed potential CoI as reported by the Center for Medicare and Medicaids Open Payments (2013 to 2017) were examined. Year of publication of citations were extracted relative to comparison textbooks (Katzungs Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (KatBCP) and DiPiros Pharmacotherapy: A Pathophysiologic Approach (DiPPAPA). Content experts in pharmacy and pharmacology education provided chapter reviews. Results: The percent of GGPBT contributors that were female (20.9%) was equivalent to those in KatBCP (17.0%). Citations in GGPBT (11.5 + 0.2 years) were significantly older than those in KatBCP (10.4 + 0.2) and DiPPAPA (9.1 + 0.1, p < .0001). Contributors to GGPBT received three million in undisclosed remuneration from pharmaceutical companies (Maximum author = $743,718). In contrast, DiPPAPA made CoI information available. However, self-reported disclosures were not uniformly congruent with Open Payments reported data. Reviewers noted several strengths but also some areas for improvement. Conclusion: GGPBT will continue to be an important component of the biomedical curriculum. Areas of improvement include more diverse authorship, improved conflict of interest transparency, and greater inclusion of more recent citations.","Piper, B. J.; Alinea, A. A.; Wroblewski, J.

501,"Contribution of Marijuana Legalization to the U.S. Opioid Mortality Epidemic: Individual and Combined Experience of 27 States and District of Columbia","Background: Prior studies of U.S. states as of 2013 and one state as of 2015 suggested that marijuana availability reduces opioid mortality (marijuana protection hypothesis). This investigation tested the hypothesis with opioid mortality trends updated to 2017 and by evaluating all states and the District of Columbia (D.C.). Methods: Opioid mortality data obtained from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were used to compare opioid death rate trends in each marijuana-legalizing state and D.C. before and after medicinal and recreational legalization implementation and their individual and cumulative aggregate trends with concomitant trends in non-legalizing states. The Joinpoint Regression Program identified statistically-significant mortality trends and when they occurred. Results: Of 23 individually evaluable legalizing jurisdictions, 78% had evidence for a statistically-significant acceleration of opioid death rates after medicinal or recreational legalization implementation at greater rates than their pre-legalization rate or the concurrent composite rate in non-legalizing states. All four jurisdictions evaluable for recreational legalization had evidence (p <0.05) for subsequent opioid death rate increases, one had a distinct acceleration, and one a reversal of prior decline. Since 2009-2012, when the cumulative-aggregate opioid death rate in the legalizing jurisdictions was the same as in the non-legalizing group, the legalizing group's rate accelerated increasingly faster (p=0.009). By 2017 it was 67% greater than in the non-legalizing group (p<0.05). Conclusions: The marijuana protection hypothesis is not supported by recent U.S. data on opioid mortality trends. Instead, legalizing marijuana appears to have contributed to the nation's opioid mortality epidemic.","Bleyer, A.; Barnes, B.",20191010,"Public And Global Health","10.1101/19007393",2,"Archie Bleyer","Oregon Health and Science University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19007393v2?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19007393v2.full.pdf","cc_by_nc",NA,"The global data are from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME).

403,"Prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy in Africa: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Introduction: Diabetes mellitus is a global health care problem and financially costly. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy is common and frequent cause of morbidity and disability. Despite its serious complications,limited evidence is available on the magnitude of diabetic peripheral neuropathy among patient with diabetes mellitus. Hence the objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the pooled prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy among patients with diabetes mellitus in Africa. Methods: PubMed Scopus Google Scholar Africa journal online WHO afro library and Cochrane review were systematically searched online to retrieve related articles. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline was followed. Heterogeneity across the included studies was evaluated by inconsistency index (I2). Publication bias was examined by funnel plot and Egger regression test. The random-effect model was fitted to estimate the pooled prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy among diabetes mellitus patients. All statistical analysis was done using STATA version 14 software for windows. Results: Twenty-three studies which comprises of 269 691 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy was 46% (95% CI:36.21-55.78%). Based on the subgroup analysis the highest magnitude of diabetic peripheral neuropathy was reported in West Africa 49.4% (95% CI: 32.74, 66.06). Conclusion: This study revealed that the overall prevalence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy is relatively high in Africa. Hence, diabetic peripheral neuropathy needs situation based intervention and preventive strategy depending on their country context. Furthermore further meta-analysis study is needed to identify associated factors for the occurrence of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

418,"Genetic Diversity of the cagA gene of Helicobacter pylori strains from Sudanese Patients with Different Gastroduodenal Diseases","Background: There is an increase in the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in Sudan, accompanied by a high incidence of upper gastrointestinal malignancy. The cytotoxin-associated gene cagA gene is a marker of a pathogenicity island (PAI) in H. pylori and plays a crucial role in determining the clinical outcome of Helicobacter infections. Objective: This study aimed to determine the frequency and heterogeneity of the cagA gene of H. pylori and correlate the presence of cagA gene with clinical outcomes. Materials and methods: Fifty endoscopy biopsies were collected from Fedail and Soba hospitals in Khartoum state. DNA was extracted using the Guanidine chloride method followed by PCR to amplify 16S rRNA and cagA gene of H. pylori using specific primers. DNA amplicons of cagA gene were purified and sequenced. Bioinformatics and statistical analysis were done to characterize and to test the association between cagA gene and gastric complications. Results: CagA gene was detected in 20/37(54%) of the samples that were found positive for H. pylori. There was no association between endoscopy finding and the presence of the cagA gene (p = 0.225). Specific amino acid variations were found at seven loci related to strains from a patient with duodenitis, gastric ulcer, and gastric atrophy (R448H, T457K, S460L, IT463-464VA, D470E, A482Q, KNV490-491-492TKT) while mutations in cancerous strain were A439P, T457P, and H500Y. Conclusion: Disease-specific variations of cagA of H. pylori strains, in the region of amino acid residues 428-510, were evident among Sudanese patients with different gastroduodenal diseases. A novel mutation (K458N) was detected in a patient with duodenitis, which affects the positive electrostatic surface of cagA. Phylogenetic analysis showed a high level of diversity of cagA from Sudanese H. pylori strains.","Hassan, H. G.; Idris, A. B.; Hassan, M. A.; Altayb, H. N.; Yasin, K.; Beirage, N.; Abdel Hamid, M.

400,"Systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between Epstein-Barr virus, Multiple Sclerosis, and other risk factors","Background: EBV infection is thought to play a central role in the development of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). If causal, it represents a target for interventions to reduce MS risk. Objective: To examine the evidence for interaction between EBV and other risk factors, and explore mechanisms via which EBV infection may influence MS risk. Methods: Pubmed was searched using the terms multiple sclerosis AND Epstein Barr virus, multiple sclerosis AND EBV, clinically isolated syndrome AND Epstein Barr virus and clinically isolated syndrome AND EBV. All abstracts were reviewed for possible inclusion. Results: 262 full-text papers were reviewed. There was evidence of interaction on the additive scale between anti-EBV antibody titre and HLA genotype (AP 0.48, p<1x10-4; RERI 3.84, p<5x10-3; S 1.68, p=0.06). Previous IM was associated with increased OR of MS in HLA-DRB1*1501 positive but not HLA-DRB1*1501 negative persons. Smoking was associated with a greater risk of MS in those with high anti-EBV antibodies (OR 2.76) but not low anti-EBV antibodies (OR 1.16). No interaction between EBV and risk factors was found on a multiplicative scale. Conclusions: EBV appears to interact with at least some established MS risk factors. The mechanism via which EBV influences MS risk remains unknown.","Jacobs, B.

491,"Isolated night cough in children: how does it differ from wheeze?","Background: Children with night cough but no wheeze might have a mild form of asthma (cough variant asthma), sharing risk factors with children who wheeze, and possibly developing wheeze later. Methods: We compared risk factors of children with isolated night cough and children with wheeze in the Leicester Respiratory Cohort study at ages 1, 4, 6, and 9 years. We also compared prognoses of children with isolated night cough, children with wheeze, and asymptomatic children. Results: Among 4,101 children at age 1 year, 2,854 at 4, 2,369 at 6, and 1,688 at 9 years, the prevalence of isolated night cough was 10% at age 1 and 18% in older children, while prevalence of wheeze decreased from 35% at 1 year to 13% at age 9. Although many risk factors were the same for cough and wheeze, day care, reflux, and family history of bronchitis were more strongly associated with cough, and male sex and family history of asthma with wheeze. Over one-third of pre-schoolers with cough continued to cough at school age, but their risk of developing wheeze was similar to that of children asymptomatic at earlier surveys. Wheeze tracked more strongly throughout childhood than cough. Conclusions: Some risk factors for cough and wheeze were shared and some were not; there was little evidence that children with isolated night cough have an increased risk of future wheeze. This suggests that only a fraction of children with isolated night cough might have a variant of asthma, if at all.","Jurca, M.; Goutaki, M.; Latzin, P.; Gaillard, E. A.; Spycher, B. D.; Kuehni, C.

689,"Quaternary Prevention: Is this Concept Relevant to Public Health? A Bibliometric and Descriptive Content Analysis.","Objective: To measure and map research output on Quaternary Prevention (P4) and outline research trends; to assess the papers content, mainly regarding methods and subjects approached in order to contribute to the improvement of global knowledge about P4 and to evaluate its relevance for public health. Design: Bibliometric and descriptive content analysis. Articles reviewed: Scientific articles about P4 recorded in Pubmed, LILACS, Scielo or CINAHL published until August 2018, with correspondent full articles available in Portuguese, English, Spanish, German or French. Main outcome measures: Year of publication, first authors' name and nationality, journals' name, country and ranking, publication language, used methods and main reported subjects. Results: 65 articles were included, published in 33 journals of 16 countries between 2003 and 2018 with a peak of publications in 2015. The first authors came from 17 different countries, 23% of them were Brazilian and Uruguay was the leading nation according to the scientific production per capita. 40% of all the selected articles were in English, 32% in Portuguese, 26% in Spanish. 28% of the papers were published in Q1 or Q2 journals. The research outputs on P4 begun first in the South of Europe, went to South America and then expanded worldwide. 88% of the articles were bibliographic research and 38% of all focused on specific examples of medical overuse (including several screening tests). Conclusions: Quaternary prevention represents an ethical and valid approach to prevent occurence of iatrogenic events and to achieve equal and fair access to health services. Conceptual, geographical and linguistic elements, as well as WONCA conferences and type of healthcare systems in the authors' country were fundamental factors that affected research output. The quality and quantity of available studies is still limited, therefore further investigations are recommended to assess the effective impact of P4 on public health.","Depallens, M.

425,"Subacute effects of the psychedelic ayahuasca on the salience and default mode networks","Background: Recent years have seen a growing interest in the therapeutic use of psychedelic substances for the treatment of anxiety and depression in patients with affective and mood disorders. Neuroimaging studies have just begun to explore how brain networks supporting perceptual and higher-order cognitive and emotional functions are affected during the acute effects of psychedelics. Even less is known on the neural correlates of the subacute effects taking place one to a few days after the psychedelic experience. This study explores the subacute changes of primary sensory brain networks and networks supporting higher-order affective and self-referential functions after a single session with the psychedelic ayahuasca. Methods: We leveraged task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging data one day before and one day after a randomized placebo-controlled trial exploring the effects of ayahuasca in naive healthy participants (21 placebo/22 ayahuasca). We derived functional connectivity maps of the salience, default mode, visual and sensorimotor networks using a seed-to-whole brain connectivity approach, and statistically assessed post-session functional connectivity changes between the ayahuasca and placebo groups. Connectivity changes were subsequently associated with scores of the Hallucinogen Rating Scale assessed during the acute session. Results: Our findings revealed increased functional connectivity in the anterior cingulate cortex of the salience network and decreased functional connectivity in the posterior cingulate cortex of the default mode network one day after the session in the ayahuasca group. No connectivity changes between groups were found in primary sensory networks. Subacute increased connectivity of the salience network correlated positively with altered somesthesia scores assessed during the acute effects of ayahuasca, while decreased connectivity of the default mode network correlated negatively with altered volition scores. Conclusion: These findings provide preliminary evidence for subacute functional changes induced by the psychedelic ayahuasca on higher-order cognitive brain networks known to support interoceptive, affective, and self-referential processes.","Pasquini, L.; Palhano-Fontes, F.; De Araujo, D.

402,"A Genome-Wide Association Study of the Frailty Index Highlights Synaptic Pathways in Aging","Frailty is a common geriatric syndrome, strongly associated with disability, mortality and hospitalisation. The mechanisms underlying frailty are multifactorial and not well understood, but a genetic basis has been suggested with heritability estimates between 19 and 45%. Understanding the genetic determinants and biological mechanisms underpinning frailty may help to delay or even prevent frailty. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of a frailty index (FI) in European descent participants from UK Biobank (n=164,610, aged 60-70 years). FI calculation was based on 49 self-reported items on symptoms, disabilities and diagnosed diseases. We identified 26 independent genetic signals at 24 loci associated with the FI (p<5*10-8). Many of these loci have previously been associated with traits such as body mass index, cardiovascular disease, smoking, HLA proteins, depression and neuroticism; however, three appear to be novel. The estimated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) heritability of the FI was 14% (0.14, SE 0.006). A genetic risk score for the FI, derived solely from the UK Biobank data, was significantly associated with FI in the Swedish TwinGene study (n=10,616, beta: 0.11, 95% CI: 0.02-0.20, p=0.015). In pathway analysis, genes associated with synapse function were significantly enriched (p<3*10-6). We also used Mendelian randomization to identify modifiable traits and exposures that may affect the risk of frailty, with a higher educational attainment genetic risk score being associated with a lower risk of frailty. Risk of frailty is influenced by many genetic factors, including well-known disease risk factors and mental health, with particular emphasis on synapse maintenance pathways.","Atkins, J.

398,"Towards accurate and unbiased imaging based differentiation of Parkinson's Disease, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy and Corticobasal Syndrome","The early and accurate differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorders is still a significant challenge for clinicians. In recent years, a number of studies have used MRI data combined with machine learning and statistical classifiers to successfully differentiate between different forms of Parkinsonism. However, several questions and methodological issues remain, to minimise bias and artefact-driven classification. In this study we compared different approaches for feature selection, as well as different MRI modalities, with well matched patient groups and tightly controlling for data quality issues related to patient motion. Our sample was drawn from a cohort of 69 healthy controls, and patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (n=35, PD), Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Richardson's syndrome (n=52, PSP) and corticobasal syndrome (n=36, CBS). Participants underwent standardised T1-weighted MPRAGE and diffusion-weighted MRI. We compared two different methods for feature selection and dimensionality reduction: whole-brain principal components analysis, and an anatomical region-of-interest based approach. In both cases, support vector machines were used to construct a statistical model for pairwise classification of healthy controls and patients. The accuracy of each model was estimated using a leave-two-out cross-validation approach, as well as an independent validation using a different set of subjects. Our cross-validation results suggest that using principal components analysis (PCA) for feature extraction provides higher classification accuracies when compared to a region-of-interest based approach. However, the differences between the two feature extraction methods were significantly reduced when an independent sample was used for validation, suggesting that the principal components analysis approach may be more vulnerable to overfitting with cross-validation. Both T1-weighted and diffusion MRI data could be used to successfully differentiate between subject groups, with neither modality outperforming the other across all pairwise comparisons in the cross-validation analysis. However, features obtained from diffusion MRI data resulted in significantly higher classification accuracies when an independent validation cohort was used. Overall, our results support the use of statistical classification approaches for differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorders. However, classification accuracy can be affected by group size, age, sex and movement artifacts. With appropriate controls and out-of-sample cross validation, diagnostic biomarker evaluation including MRI based classifiers can be an important adjunct to clinical evaluation.","Correia, M.

397,"Predicting Under-five mortality across 21 Low and Middle-Income Countries using Deep Learning Methods","Objectives: To explore the efficacy of Machine Learning (ML) techniques in predicting under-five mortality in LMICs and to identify significant predictors of under-five mortality (U5M). Design: This is a cross-sectional, proof-of-concept study. Settings and participants We analysed data from the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The data was drawn from 21 Low-and-Middle Income Countries (LMICs) countries (N = 1,048,575). Eligible mothers in each household were asked information about their children and the reproductive care they received during the pregnancy. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The primary outcome measure was under-five mortality; secondary outcome was comparing the efficacy of deep learning algorithms: Deep Neural Network (DNN); Convolution Neural Network (CNN); Hybrid CNN-DNN with Logistic Regression (LR) for the prediction of child survival. Results: We found that duration of breast feeding, household wealth index and the level of maternal education are the most important predictors of under-five mortality. We found that deep learning techniques are superior to LR for the classification of child survival: LR sensitivity = 0.47, specificity = 0.53; DNN sensitivity = 0.69, specificity = 0.83; CNN sensitivity = 0.68, specificity = 0.83; CNN-DNN sensitivity = 0.71, specificity = 0.83. Conclusion: Our findings provide an understanding of interventions that needs to be prioritized, in order to reduce levels of U5M in LMICs. It also demonstrates that deep learning models are more efficacious than a traditional analytical approach.","Adegbosin, A.

We tested effectiveness of oral terbinafine plus griseofulvin versus terbinafine alone in tinea corporis, tinea cruris and tinea faciei in a randomized pragmatic open trial. Methods: One hundred and thirty two microscopy confirmed patients were randomly allocated (ratio 1:1) to two groups, terbinafine (T) and terbinafine plus griseofulvin (T+G). Doses given were as follows: T, oral terbinafine (6 mg/kg/day, maximum 500 mg/day, once daily); T+G, terbinafine (as above) plus oral griseofulvin (children [<18 years] 10 mg/kg/day, adults [18 years or more] 10 mg/kg/day, but not <500 mg and not >1000 mg per day, in two divided doses). Patients were treated for 8 weeks or cure, whichever occurred earlier. Results: At 4 weeks, none of the patients were cured in both groups. At 6 weeks, 1(1.5%) and 4 (6.1%) patients were cured in T and T+G groups, respectively (P=0.417). At 8 weeks, 17 (25.8%) and 19 (28.8%) patients were cured in T and T+G groups, respectively (P=0.845). For cure rate at 8 weeks, number needed to treat (NNT) for T+G (versus T), was 33. Conclusions: Addition of griseofulvin to terbinafine does not increase effectiveness of terbinafine in current epidemic of altered dermatophytosis in India.","Singh, S.; Anchan, V.

457,"PERIPHERAL BLOOD AS TOOL TO DETERMINE GENE EXPRESSION PATTERNS IN PATIENTS WITH PSYCHIATRIC, NEUROLOGICAL AND OTHER COMMON DISORDERS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS PROTOCOL","Introduction: Common diseases are influenced by a variety of factors that can enhance one person's susceptibility to developing a specific condition. Complex traits have been investigated in several biological levels. One that reflects the high interconnectivity and interaction of genes, proteins and transcription factors is the transcriptome. In this study, we disclose the protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis aiming at summarizing the available evidence regarding transcriptomic gene expression levels of peripheral blood samples comparing subjects with psychiatric, neurological and other common disorders to healthy controls. Methods and analysis: The investigation of the transcriptomic levels in the peripheral blood enables the unique opportunity to unravel the etiology of common diseases in patients ex-vivo. However, the experimental results should be minimally consistent across studies for them to be considered as the best approximation of the true effect. In order to test this, we will systematically identify all transcriptome studies that compared subjects with common disorders to their respective control samples. We will apply meta-analyses to assess the overall differentially expressed genes throughout the studies of each condition. Ethics and dissemination: The data that will be used to conduct this study are available online and have already been published following their own ethical laws. Therefore this study requires no further ethical approval. The results of this study will be published in leading peer-reviewed journals of the area and also presented at relevant national and international conferences.","Panzenhagen, A.

420,"Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) Blocking Agents Reduce Risk for Alzheimer's Disease in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis and Psoriasis","This large, retrospective case-control study of electronic health records from 56 million unique adult patients examined whether or not treatment with a Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) blocking agent is associated with lower risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis, and other inflammatory diseases which are mediated in part by TNF and for which a TNF blocker is an approved treatment. The analysis compared the diagnosis of AD as an outcome measure in patients receiving at least one prescription for a TNF blocking agent (etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab) or for methotrexate. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were estimated using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) method and presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and p-values. RA was associated with a higher risk for AD (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 2.06, 95% Confidence Interval: (2.02-2.10), P-value <0.0001) as did psoriasis (AOR = 1.37 (1.31-1.42), P <0.0001), ankylosing spondylitis (AOR = 1.57 (1.39-1.77), P <0.0001) , inflammatory bowel disease (AOR = 2.46 (2.33-2.59), P < 0.0001), ulcerative colitis (AOR = 1.82 (1.74-1.91), P <0.0001), and Crohn's disease (AOR = 2.33 (2.22-2.43), P <0.0001). The risk for AD in patients with RA was lower among patients treated with etanercept (AOR = 0.34 (0.25-0.47), P <0.0001), adalimumab (AOR = 0.28 (0.19-0.39), P < 0.0001), or infliximab (AOR = 0.52 (0.39-0.69), P <0.0001). Methotrexate was also associated with a lower risk for AD (AOR = 0.64 (0.61-0.68), P <0.0001), while lower risk was found in patients with a prescription history for both a TNF blocker and methotrexate. Etanercept and adalimumab also were associated with lower risk for AD in patients with psoriasis: AOR = 0.47 (0.30-0.73 and 0.41 (0.20-0.76), respectively. There was no effect of gender or race, while younger patients showed greater benefit from a TNF blocker than did older patients. This study identifies a subset of patients in whom systemic inflammation contributes to risk for AD through a pathological mechanism involving TNF and who therefore may benefit from treatment with a TNF blocking agent.","Zhou, M.; Kaelber, D.; Xu, R.; Gurney, M.",20190927,"Neurology","10.1101/19007666",1,"Mengshi Zhou","Case Western Reserve University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19007666v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19007666v1.full.pdf","cc_no","10.1371/journal.pone.0229819","The data underlying the results presented in the study are available from  http://nlp.case.edu/public/data/TNF-AD/"
422,"Whole genome sequencing identifies putative associations between genomic polymorphisms and clinical response to the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam","In the context of pharmacogenomics, whole genome sequencing provides a powerful approach for identifying correlations between response variability to specific drugs and genomic polymorphisms in a population, in an unbiased manner. In this study, we employed whole genome sequencing of DNA samples from patients showing extreme response (n=72) and non-response (n=27) to the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam, in order to identify genomic variants that underlie response to the drug. No common SNPs (MAF>5%) crossed the conventional genome-wide significance threshold of 5e-8. However, we found common polymorphisms in genes SPNS3, HDC, MDGA2, NSG1 and RASGEF1C, which collectively predict clinical response to levetiracetam in our cohort with ~91% predictive accuracy (~94% positive predictive value, ~85% negative predictive value). Among these genes, HDC, NSG1, MDGA2 and RASGEF1C are potentially implicated in synaptic neurotransmission. SPNS3 is an atypical solute carrier transporter, homologous to SV2A, the known molecular target of levetiracetam. Furthermore, we performed gene- and pathway-based statistical analysis on sets of rare and low-frequency variants (MAF<5%) and we identified associations between genes or pathways and response to levetiracetam. Our findings include a) the genes PRKCB and DLG2, which are involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission, a known target of anticonvulsants, including levetiracetam; b) the genes FILIP1 and SEMA6D, which are involved in axon guidance and modelling of neural connections; and c) pathways with a role in synaptic neurotransmission, such as WNT5A-dependent internalization of FZD4 and disinhibition of SNARE formation. Targeted analysis of genes involved in neurotransmitter release and transport further supports the possibility of association between drug response and genes NSG1 and DLG2. In summary, our approach to utilise whole genome sequencing on subjects with extreme response phenotypes is a feasible route to generate plausible hypotheses for investigating the genetic factors underlying drug response variability in cases of pharmaco-resistant epilepsy.","Vavoulis, D.

417,"Interleukin-6 signaling effects on ischemic stroke and other cardiovascular outcomes: a Mendelian Randomization study","Background: Studies in humans and experimental models highlight a role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in cardiovascular disease. Indirect evidence suggests that inhibition of IL-6 signaling could lower risk of coronary artery disease. However, whether such an approach would be effective for ischemic stroke and other cardiovascular outcomes remains unknown. Methods: In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 204,402 European individuals, we identified genetic proxies for downregulated IL-6 signaling as genetic variants in the IL-6 receptor (IL6R) locus that were associated with lower C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, a downstream effector of IL-6 signaling. We then applied two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore associations with ischemic stroke and its major subtypes (large artery stroke, cardioembolic stroke, small vessel stroke) in the MEGASTROKE dataset (34,217 cases and 404,630 controls), with coronary artery disease in the CARDIoGRAMplusC4D dataset (60,801 cases and 123,504 control), and with other cardiovascular outcomes in the UK Biobank (up to 321,406 individuals) and in phenotype-specific GWAS datasets. All effect estimates were scaled to the CRP-decreasing effects of tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-6R. Results: We identified 7 genetic variants as proxies for downregulated IL-6 signaling, which showed effects on upstream regulators (IL-6 and soluble IL-6R levels) and downstream effectors (CRP and fibrinogen levels) of the pathway that were consistent with pharmacological blockade of IL-6R. In MR, proxies for downregulated IL-6 signaling were associated with lower risk of ischemic stroke (Odds Ratio [OR]: 0.89, 95%CI: 0.82-0.97) and coronary artery disease (OR: 0.84, 95%CI: 0.77-0.90). Focusing on ischemic stroke subtypes, we found significant associations with risk of large artery (OR: 0.76, 95%CI: 0.62-0.93) and small vessel stroke (OR: 0.71, 95%CI: 0.59-0.86), but not cardioembolic stroke (OR: 0.95, 95%CI: 0.74-1.22). Proxies for IL-6 signaling inhibition were further associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction, aortic aneurysm, atrial fibrillation and carotid plaque. Conclusions: We provide evidence for a causal effect of IL-6 signaling on ischemic stroke, particularly large artery and small vessel stroke, and a range of other cardiovascular outcomes. IL-6R blockade might represent a valid therapeutic target for lowering cardiovascular risk and should thus be investigated in clinical trials.","Georgakis, M. K.; Malik, R.; Gill, D.

448,"Systematic review and network meta-analysis with individual participant data on Cord Management at Preterm Birth (iCOMP): study protocol","Introduction: Timing of cord clamping and other cord management strategies may improve outcomes at preterm birth. However, it is unclear whether benefits apply to all preterm subgroups such as those who usually receive immediate neonatal care. Previous and current trials compare various policies, including immediate cord clamping, time- or physiology-based deferred cord clamping, and cord milking. Individual participant data (IPD) enables exploration of different strategies within subgroups. Network meta-analysis (NMA) enables comparison and ranking of all available interventions using a combination of direct and indirect comparisons. Objectives: 1) To evaluate the effectiveness of cord management strategies for preterm infants on neonatal mortality and morbidity overall and for different participant characteristics using IPD meta-analysis; and 2) to evaluate and rank the effect of different cord management strategies for preterm births on mortality and other key outcomes using NMA. Methods and analysis: We will conduct a systematic search of Medline, Embase, clinical trial registries, and other sources for all planned, ongoing and completed randomised controlled trials comparing alternative cord management strategies at preterm birth (before 37 weeks' gestation). IPD will be sought for all trials. First, deferred clamping and cord milking will be compared with immediate clamping in pairwise IPD meta-analyses. The primary outcome will be death prior to hospital discharge. Effect differences will be explored for pre-specified subgroups of participants. Second, all identified cord management strategies will be compared and ranked in an IPD NMA for the primary outcome and the key secondary outcomes intraventricular haemorrhage (any grade) and infant blood transfusions (any). Treatment effect differences by participant characteristics will be identified. Inconsistency and heterogeneity will be explored. Ethics and dissemination: Approved by University of Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee (2018/886). Results will be relevant to clinicians, guideline-developers and policy-makers, and will be disseminated via publications, presentations, and media releases.","Seidler, A. L.

523,"Reorganization of nurse scheduling reduces the risk of healthcare associated infections","Background. Efficient prevention and control of healthcare associated infections (HAIs) is still an open problem. Objective. To design efficient hospital infection control strategies by reorganizing nurse scheduling. Design, setting, and participants. Proof-of-concept modeling study based on high-resolution contact data from wearable sensors between patients, nurses, doctors, and administrative staff at a short-stay geriatric ward of a University hospital. Methods. We considered isolation and contact removal to identify the most important class of individuals for HAI dissemination. We introduced a novel intervention based on the reorganization of nurse scheduling. This strategy switches and reassigns nurses' tasks through the optimization of shift timelines, while respecting feasibility constraints and satisfying patient-care requirements. We evaluated the impact of interventions through a Susceptible-Colonized-Susceptible transmission model on the empirical and reorganized contacts. Results. Isolation and contact removal produced the largest risk reduction when acting on nurses. Reorganizing their schedules reduced HAI risk by 27% (95% confidence interval [24,29]%) while preserving the timeliness, number, and duration of contacts. More than 30% nurse-nurse contacts should be avoided to achieve an equivalent reduction through simple contact removal. No overall change in the number of nurses per patient resulted from the intervention. Conclusions. Reorganization of nurse scheduling offers an alternative change of practice that substantially limits HAI risk in the ward while ensuring the timeliness and quality of healthcare services. This calls for including optimization of nurse scheduling practices in programs for better infection control in hospitals.","Valdano, E.; Poletto, C.; Boelle, P.-Y.; Colizza, V.",20191018,"Epidemiology","10.1101/19007724",1,"Vittoria Colizza","INSERM, Sorbonne Universite, Institut Pierre Louis d\'Epidemiologie et de Sante Publique (IPLESP), Paris, France","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19007724v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19007724v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"Data have been made publically available by data owner"
438,"MicroRNA-mRNA networks define translatable molecular outcome phenotypes in osteosarcoma.","Background: There is a lack of well validated biomarkers in osteosarcoma, a rare, recalcitrant disease with variable outcome and poorly understood biologic behavior, for which treatment standards have stalled for decades. The only standard prognostic factor in osteosarcoma remains the amount of pathologic necrosis following pre-operative chemotherapy, which does not adequately capture the biologic complexity of the tumor and has not resulted in optimized patient therapeutic stratification. New, robust biomarkers are needed to understand prognosis and better reflect the underlying biologic and molecular complexity of this disease. Methods: We performed microRNA sequencing in 74 frozen osteosarcoma biopsy samples, the largest single center translationally analyzed cohort to date, and separately analyzed a multi-omic dataset from a large (n = 95) NCI supported national cooperative group cohort. Molecular patterns were tested for association with outcome and used to identify novel therapeutics for further study by integrative pharmacogenomic analysis. Results: MicroRNA profiles were found predict Recurrence Free Survival (5-microRNA profile, Median RFS 59 vs 202 months, log rank p=0.06, HR 1.87, 95% CI 0.96-3.66). The profiles were independently prognostic of RFS when controlled for metastatic disease at diagnosis and pathologic necrosis following chemotherapy in multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression (5-microRNA profile, HR 3.31, 95% CI 1.31-8.36, p=0.01). Strong trends for survival discrimination were observed in the independent NCI dataset, and transcriptomic analysis revealed the downstream microRNA regulatory targets are also predictive of survival (median RFS 17 vs 105 months, log rank p=0.007). Additionally, DNA methylation patterns held prognostic significance. Through machine learning based integrative pharmacogenomic analysis, the microRNA biomarkers identify novel therapeutics for further study and stratified application in osteosarcoma. Conclusions: Our results support the existence of molecularly defined phenotypes in osteosarcoma associated with distinct outcome independent of clinicopathologic features. We validated candidate microRNA profiles and their associated molecular networks for prognostic value in multiple independent datasets. These networks may define previously unrecognized osteosarcoma subtypes with distinct molecular context and clinical course potentially appropriate for future application of tailored treatment strategies in different patient subgroups.","Lietz, C.

421,"Machine learning-based prediction of response to PARP inhibition across cancer types.","PARP inhibitors (PARPi) are FDA approved for the treatment of BRCA1/2 deficient breast and ovarian cancer, but a growing body of pre-clinical evidence suggests the drug class holds therapeutic potential in other cancer types, independent of BRCA1/2 status. Large-scale pharmacogenomic datasets offer the opportunity to develop predictors of response to PARPis in many cancer types, expanding their potential clinical applicability. Response to the PARPi olaparib was used to identify a multi-gene PARPi response signature in a large in vitro dataset including multiple cancer types, such as breast, ovarian, pancreatic, lung cancer, osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma, using machine learning approaches. The signature was validated on multiple independent in vitro datasets, also testing for response to another PARPi, rucaparib, as well as two clinical datasets using the cisplatin response as a surrogate for PARPi response. Finally, integrative pharmacogenomic analysis was performed to identify drugs which may be effective in PARPi resistant tumors. A PARPi response signature was defined as the 50 most differentially transcribed genes between PARPi resistant and sensitive cell lines from several different cancer types. Cross validated predictors generated with LASSO logistic regression using the PARPi signature genes accurately predicted PARPi response in a training set of olaparib treated cell lines (80-89%), an independent olaparib treated in vitro dataset (66-77%), and an independent rucaparib treated in vitro dataset (80-87%). The PARPi signature also significantly predicted in vitro breast cancer response to olaparib in another separate experimental dataset. The signature also predicted clinical response to cisplatin and survival in human ovarian cancer and osteosarcoma datasets. Robust transcriptional differences between PARPi sensitive and resistant tumors accurately predict PARPi response in vitro and cisplatin response in vivo for multiple tumor types with or without known BRCA1/2 deficiency. These signatures may prove useful for predicting response in patients treated with PARP inhibitors.","Hill, K. E.; Rattani, A.; Lietz, C. E.; Garbutt, C.; Choy, E.; Cote, G.

459,"A machine learning approach for precision diagnosis of juvenile-onset SLE","Juvenile-Onset systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE) is an autoimmune rheumatic disease characterised by systemic inflammation and organ damage, with disease onset often coinciding with puberty. JSLE is associated with more severe disease manifestations and a higher motility rate compared to adult SLE. Due to the heterogeneous clinical and immunological manifestations of JSLE, delayed diagnosis and poor treatment efficacy are major barriers for improving patient outcome. In order to define a unique immunophenotyping profile distinguishing JSLE patients from age matched healthy controls, immune-based machine learning (ML) approaches were applied. Balanced random forest analysis discriminated JSLE patients from healthy controls with an overall 91% prediction accuracy. The top-ranked immunological features were selected from the optimal ML model and were validated by partial least squares discriminant analysis and logistic regression analysis. Patients could be clustered into four distinct groups based on the top hits from the ML model, providing an opportunity for tailored therapy. Moreover, complex correlations between the JSLE immune profile and clinical features of disease were identified. Further immunological association studies are essential for developing data-driven personalised medicine approaches to aid diagnosis of JSLE for targeted therapy and improved patient outcomes.","Robinson, G.

468,"Autoantibodies against the prion protein in individuals with PRNP mutations","Objective. To determine whether naturally occurring autoantibodies against the prion protein are present in individuals with genetic prion disease mutations and controls, and if so, whether they are protective against prion disease. Methods. In this case-control study, we collected 124 blood samples from individuals with a variety of pathogenic PRNP mutations and 78 control individuals with a positive family history of genetic prion disease but lacking disease-associated PRNP mutations. Antibody reactivity was measured using an indirect ELISA for the detection of human IgG1-4 antibodies against wild-type human prion protein. Multivariate linear regression models were constructed to analyze differences in autoantibody reactivity between a) PRNP mutation carriers versus controls and b) asymptomatic versus symptomatic PRNP mutation carriers. Robustness of results was examined in matched cohorts. Results. We found that antibody reactivity was present in a subset of both PRNP mutation carriers and controls. Autoantibody levels were not influenced by PRNP mutation status nor clinical manifestation of prion disease. Post hoc analyses showed anti-PrPC autoantibody titers to be independent of personal history of autoimmune disease and other immunological disorders, as well as PRNP codon 129 polymorphism. Conclusions. Pathogenic PRNP variants do not notably stimulate antibody-mediated anti-PrPC immunity. Anti-PrPC IgG autoantibodies are not associated with the onset of prion disease. The presence of anti-PrPC autoantibodies in the general population without any disease-specific association suggests that relatively high titers of naturally occurring antibodies are well tolerated.

423,"Acquisition of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) carriage after exposure to systemic antimicrobials during travel: systematic review and meta-analysis.","Background: International travel is an important risk factor for colonization with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE). Antimicrobial use during travel likely amplifies this risk, yet to what extent, and whether it varies by antimicrobial class, has not been established. Methods: We conducted a systematic review that included prospective cohorts reporting both receipt of systemic antimicrobials and acquired ESBL-PE isolated from stool or rectum during international travel. We performed a random effects meta-analysis to estimate odds of acquiring ESBL-PE due to antimicrobials during travel, overall and by antimicrobial class. Results: Fifteen studies were included. The study population was mainly female travellers from high income countries recruited primarily from travel clinics. Participants travelled most frequently to Asia and Africa with 10% reporting antimicrobial use during travel. The combined odds ratio (OR) for ESBL-PE acquisition during travel was 2.37 for antimicrobial use overall (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.69 to 3.33), but there was substantial heterogeneity between studies. Fluoroquinolones were the antibiotic class associated with the highest combined OR of ESBL-PE acquisition, compared to no antimicrobial use (OR 4.68, 95% CI, 2.34 to 9.37). Conclusions: The risk of ESBL-PE colonization during travel is increased substantially with exposure to antimicrobials, especially fluoroquinolones. While a small proportion of colonized individuals will develop a resistant infection, there remains the potential for onward spread among returning travellers. Public health efforts to decrease inappropriate antimicrobial usage during travel are warranted.","Wuerz, T.; Kassim, S.; Atkins, K.",20190927,"Infectious Diseases","10.1101/19007781",1,"Terence Wuerz","University of Manitoba","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19007781v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19007781v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"There are no external datasets available for this article.

430,"Clinical and laboratory characteristics of clozapine treated schizophrenia patients referred to a national immunodeficiency clinic reveals a B-cell signature resembling CVID.","Purpose: An association between antibody deficiency and clozapine use in individuals with Schizophrenia has recently been reported. We hypothesized that if clozapine-associated hypogammaglobulinaemia was clinically relevant this would manifest in referral patterns. Methods: Retrospective case note review of patients referred and assessed by Immunology Centre for Wales (ICW) between January 2005 and July 2018 with extraction of clinical and immunologic features for individuals with diagnosis of schizophrenia-like illness. Results: 1791 adult patients were assessed at ICW during this period; 23 patients had a psychiatric diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder. Principal indications for referral were findings of low calculated globulin and immunoglobulins. Clozapine was the single most commonly prescribed antipsychotic (17/23), disproportionately increased relative to reported use in the general schizophrenia population (OR 6.48, 95% CI: 1.79 to 23.5). Clozapine therapy was noted in 6/7 (86%) of patients subsequently requiring immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT). Marked reduction of class-switched memory B-cells (CSMB) and plasmablasts were observed in clozapine-treated individuals relative to healthy age-matched controls. Clozapine duration is associated with CSMB decline. One patient discontinued clozapine, with gradual recovery of IgG levels without use of IgRT. Conclusion: Our findings are consistent with enrichment of clozapine-treatment within schizophrenic individuals referred for ICW assessment over the last 13 years. These individuals displayed clinical patterns closely resembling the primary immunodeficiency CVID, however appears reversible upon drug cessation. This has diagnostic, monitoring and treatment implications for psychiatry and immunology teams and directs prospective studies to address causality and the wider implications for this patient group.","Ponsford, M.

465,"Incidence of Respiratory distress and its predictors among neonates admitted at neonatal intensive care unit, Black Lion Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 2019.","Background: Although Respiratory distress is one of the major causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality throughout the globe, it is a serious concern more of in resource limited nations, like Ethiopia. Besides, few studies are available in developing countries. Data from different settings is needed to tackle it. Therefore, we intended to assess the incidence and predictors of respiratory distress among neonates who were admitted in neonatal Intensive care unit (NICU) at Black Lion Specialized Hospital, Ethiopia. Methods: Institution-based retrospective follow-up study was conducted among 571 neonates from January 2013 to March 2018. Data were collected by reviewing patients chart using systematic sampling technique with a pretested checklist; entered using Epi-data 4.2 and analyzed with STATA 14. Median time, Kaplan-Meier survival estimation curve and Log-rank test were computed. Bivariable and multivariable Gompertz parametric hazards models were fitted to detect the determinant of respiratory distress. Hazard ratio with a 95% confidence interval was calculated. Variables with reported p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: The proportion of respiratory distress among of neonates admitted in Black Lion specialized hospital neonatal intensive care unit was 42.9 % (95%CI: 39.3-46.1%) with incidence of 8.1/100(95%CI: 7.3, 8.9)).Being male [AHR=2.4 (95%CI:1.1,3.1)], neonates born via caesarean section [AHR:1.9((95%CI:1.6,2.3)], home delivery [AHR :2.9 (95%CI:1.5, 5,2)], maternal diabetes mellitus [AHR 2.3(95%CI: 1.4 ,3.6)], preterm birth [AHR:2.9(95%CI:1.6, 5.1)] and APGAR score less than 7 [AHR: 3.1 (95%CI:1.8,5.0)] were found to be significant predictors of respiratory distress. Conclusions: The incidence of respiratory distress among neonates was found to be high. Those neonates delivered at home, delivered through caesarean section, preterm neonates, whose APGAR score<7, and born from diabetic mothers were more likely to develop respiratory distress. All concerned bodies should work on preventing RD and give special attention for multifactorial cause of it .Thus; it is indicated to promote health institutional delivery more.

467,"Frontal and cerebellar atrophy supports FTLD-ALS clinical continuum and neuropsychology","Objective: Frontotemporal Lobe Degeneration (FTLD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) are neurodegenerative diseases more often considered as a continuum from clinical, epidemiologic and genetic perspectives. We used localized brain atrophy to evaluate common and specific features of FTLD, FTLD-ALS and ALS patients to clarify this clinical continuum. Methods: We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) on structural MRI images to localize volume alterations of brain regions in group comparisons: patients (20 FTLD, 7 FTLD-ALS, 18 ALS) versus controls (39 CTR) and patient groups between themselves. We used whole-brain cortical thickness (CT) to assess correlations with brain volume to propose mechanistic explanations of the heterogeneous clinical presentations. We assessed whether brain atrophy can explain cognitive impairment, measured with neuropsychological tests (Frontal Assessment Battery, verbal fluency and semantic fluency). Results: Common (mainly frontal) and specific areas of atrophy between FTLD, FTLD-ALS and ALS patients were detected, on the one hand confirming the suggestion of a clinical continuum, while on the other hand defining morphological specificities for each clinical group (e.g. a different cerebral and cerebellar involvement between FTLD and ALS). CT values suggested extensive network disruption in the pathological process, with indications of a correlation between white matter volume and CT in ALS. The correlation between neuropsychological scores pointed at an important role of the cerebellum, together with frontotemporal regions, in explaining cognitive impairment at the level of executive and linguistic functions. Conclusions: We identified common elements that explain the FTLD-ALS clinical continuum, while also identifying specificities of each group, partially explained by different cerebral and cerebellar involvement.","Pizzarotti, B.; Palesi, F.; Vitali, P.; Castellazzi, G.; Anzalone, N.; Alvisi, E.; Martinelli, D.; Bernini, S.; Cotta Ramusino, M.; Ceroni, M.; Micieli, G.; Sinforiani, E.; D'angelo, E.; Costa, A.; Gandini Wheeler-Kingshott, C.

630,"Anti-Diabetic and Antiresorptive Pharmacotherapies for Prevention and Treatment of Type 2 Diabetes-Induced Bone Disease: Protocol for a Two-Part Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis","Introduction Glucocorticoid (GC) administration is an effective therapy commonly used in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. However, the use of GC can give rise to serious complications. The main detrimental side effect of GC therapy is significant bone loss, resulting in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP). There are a variety of treatments available for preventing and managing GIOP; however, without clearly defined guidelines, it can be very difficult for physicians to choose the optimal therapy for their patients. Previous network meta-analyses (NMAs) and meta-analyses did not include all available RCT trials, or only performed pairwise comparisons. We present a protocol for a NMA that incorporates all available RCT patient data to provide the most comprehensive ranking of all available GIOP treatments in terms of their ability to increase bone mineral density (BMD) and decrease fracture incidences among adult patients undergoing GC treatments. Methods and Analysis We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, CENTRAL and Chinese literature sources (CNKI, CQVIP, Wanfang Data, Wanfang Med Online) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which fit our criteria. RCTs that evaluate different antiresorptive regimens taken by adult patients undergoing GC therapy during the study or had taken GC for at least 3 months in the year prior to study commencement with lumbar spine BMD, femoral neck BMD, total hip BMD, vertebral fracture incidences and/or non-vertebral fracture incidences as outcomes will be selected. We will perform title/abstract and full-text screening as well as data extraction in duplicate. Risk of bias (ROB) will be evaluated in duplicate for each study, and the quality of evidence will be examined using CINeMA in accordance to the GRADE framework. We will use R and gemtc to perform the NMA. We will report BMD results as weighted mean differences (WMDs) and standardized mean differences (SMDs), and we will report fracture incidences as odds ratios. We will use the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) scores to provide numerical estimations of the rankings of interventions. Ethics and Dissemination The study will not require ethical approval. The findings of the NMA will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at conferences. We aim to produce the most comprehensive quantitative analysis regarding the management of GIOP. Our analysis should be able to provide physicians and patients with an up-to-date recommendation for pharmacotherapies in reducing incidences of bone loss and fractures associated with GIOP.

1026,"Travel time to health facilities as a marker of geographical accessibility across heterogeneous land coverage in Peru","The geographical accessibility to health facilities is conditioned by the topography and environmental conditions overlapped with different transport facilities between rural and urban areas. To better estimate the travel time to the most proximate health facility infrastructure and determine the differences across heterogeneous land coverage types, this study explored the use of a novel cloud-based geospatial modeling approach and use as a case study the unique geographical and ecological diversity in the Peruvian territory. Geospatial data of 145,134 cities and villages and 8,067 health facilities in Peru were gathered with land coverage types, roads infrastructure, navigable river networks, and digital elevation data to produce high-resolution (30 m) estimates of travel time to the most proximate health facility across the country. This study estimated important variations in travel time between urban and rural settings across the 16 major land coverage types in Peru, that in turn, overlaps with socio-economic profiles of the villages. The median travel time to primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare facilities was 1.9, 2.3, and 2.2 folds higher in rural than urban settings, respectively. Also, higher travel time values were observed in areas with a high proportion of the population with unsatisfied basic needs. In so doing, this study provides a new methodology to estimate travel time to health facilities as a tool to enhance the understanding and characterization of the profiles of accessibility to health facilities in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), calling for a service delivery redesign to maximize high quality of care.","Carrasco-Escobar, G.; Manrique, E.; Tello-Lizarraga, K.; Miranda, J.

473,"Not all animals are equal - farm living and allergy in Upper Bavaria","Background: A lower allergy and asthma prevalence in farm children has been described three decades ago in Switzerland. Objective: After years of research into bacterial exposure at farms, the origin of the farm effect is still unknown. We now hypothesize, that there is no such an effect in large industrial cattle farms with slatted floors indoors but in small farms only where animals are grazing outdoors and are having a higher endoparasite load. Methods: We re-analyze an earlier epidemiological study by record-linkage to later agricultural surveys. The Asthma and Allergy Study in 1989/90 was a cross-sectional study of 1714 ten year old children in 63 villages covering ten different districts of Upper Bavaria. The farm effect is defined here as the association of number of cows per villager on lifetime prevalence of allergic rhinitis prevalence in the children of this village. Results: The farm effect is restricted to small villages only. Furthermore, districts with higher Fasciola infection rates of cows, show a significant stronger farm effect than districts with lower infection rates. Conclusion: The results warrant further research into human immune response to endoparasites in livestock.","Wjst, M.",20191008,"Allergy And Immunology","10.1101/19007864",1,"Matthias Wjst","Helmholtz Zentrum Muenchen","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19007864v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19007864v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"Aggregated epidemiological data on village basis are available from the author.

455,"Predicting youth diabetes risk using NHANES data and machine learning","Type 2 diabetes has become alarmingly prevalent among youth in recent years. However, simple questionnaire-based screening tools to reliably identify diabetes risk and prevent the adverse effects of this serious disease are only available for adults, not for youth. As a first step in developing such a tool, we used a large-scale dataset from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES), to examine the performance of a well-known adult diabetes risk self-assessment screener and published pediatric clinical screening guidelines in identifying youth with pre-diabetes/diabetes (pre-DM/DM) based on American Diabetes Association diagnostic biomarkers. We assessed the agreement between the adult screener/pediatric screening guidelines and biomarker diagnostic criteria by conducting comparisons using the overall data set and sub-datasets stratified by sex, race/ethnicity, and age. While the pediatric guidelines performed better than the adult screener in identifying youth with pre-DM/DM (sensitivity 43.1% vs 7.2%), both are inadequate for general deployment among youth. There were also notable differences in the performance of the pediatric guidelines across subgroups based on age, sex and race/ethnicity. In an effort to improve pre-DM/DM screening, we also evaluated data-driven machine learning-based classification algorithms, several of which performed slightly but statistically significantly better than the pediatric screening guidelines.","Vangeepuram, N.; Liu, B.; Chiu, P.-H.; Wang, L.; Pandey, G.",20191005,"Pediatrics","10.1101/19007872",1,"Nita Vangeepuram","Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19007872v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19007872v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"Only publicly available NHANES data were used in this study.

434,"Machine learning assisted DSC-MRI radiomics as a tool for glioma classification by grade and mutation status","Background: Machine learning assisted MRI radiomics, which combines MRI techniques with machine learning methodology, is rapidly gaining attention as a promising method for staging of brain gliomas. Our study assess the diagnostic value of such machine learning for DSC-MRI radiomics in classifying treatment-naive gliomas from a multi-center patient pool into WHO grades II-IV and across their isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status. Methods: 333 patients from 6 tertiary centres, diagnosed histologically and molecularly with primary gliomas (IDH-mutant=151 or IDH-wildtype=182) were retrospectively identified. Raw DSC-MRI data was post-processed for normalised leakage-corrected relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps. Shape, intensity distribution (histogram) and rotational invariant Haralick texture features over the tumour mask were extracted. Differences in extracted features between IDH-wildtype and IDH-mutant gliomas and across three glioma grades were tested using the Wilcoxon two-sample test. A random forest algorithm was employed (2-fold cross-validation, 250 repeats) to predict grades or mutation status using the extracted features. Results: Features from all types (shape, distribution, texture) showed significant differences across mutation status. WHO grade II-III differentiation was mostly driven by shape features while texture and intensity feature were more relevant for the III-IV separation. Increased number of features became significant when differentiating grades further apart from one another. Gliomas were correctly stratified by IDH mutation status in 71% of the cases and by grade in 53% of the cases. In addition, 87% of the gliomas grades predicted with an error distance up to 1. Conclusion: Despite large heterogeneity in the multi-center dataset, machine learning assisted DSC-MRI radiomics hold potential to address the inherent variability and presents a promising approach for non-invasive glioma molecular subtyping and grading.

605,"Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Disrupts Functional Dynamic Attractors of Healthy Mental States","The human brain has the ability of changing its wiring configuration by increasing or decreasing functional connectivity strength between specific areas. Variable but recurring configuration patterns in dynamic functional connectivity have been observed during resting fMRI experiments, patterns which are defined as dynamic brain states. The question arises whether in a regular healthy brain these states evolve in a random fashion or in a specific sequential order. The current work reveals both the specific state sequence in healthy brains, as well as the set of disruptions in this sequence produced by traumatic brain injury. The healthy sequence consists of oscillatory dynamic connectivity patterns that orbit an attractor state in a high dimensional space. Using discovery (96 subjects) and replication (74 subjects) cohorts, this study demonstrated that mild traumatic brain injury results in immediate orbital disruptions that recover over time. Brain dynamics enter a status of disrupted orbits right after injury, with partial recovery at 4 weeks, and full recovery at 3 months post-injury. In summary, our results describe an aspect of neuronal dysfunction in mild traumatic brain injury that is fully based on brain state dynamics, and different from traditional brain connectivity strength measures.","Vergara, V.

696,"Findings of a feasibility study of pre-operative pulmonary rehabilitation to reduce post-operative pulmonary complications in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease scheduled for major abdominal surgery.","Background: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of complications and death following surgery. Pulmonary complications are particularly prominent. Pulmonary rehabilitation is a course of physical exercise and education that helps people with COPD manage their condition. Although proven to improve health outcomes in patients with stable COPD, it has never been formally tested as a pre-surgical intervention in patients scheduled for non-cardiothoracic surgery. If a beneficial effect were to be demonstrated, pulmonary rehabilitation for pre-surgical patients with COPD might be rapidly implemented across the National Health Service, as pulmonary rehabilitation courses are already well established across much of the United Kingdom (UK). Methods: We performed a feasibility study to test study procedures and barriers to identification and recruitment to a randomised controlled trial testing whether pulmonary rehabilitation, delivered before major abdominal surgery in a population of people with COPD, would reduce the incidence of post-operative pulmonary complications. This study was run in two UK centres (Oxford and Newcastle upon Tyne). Results: We determined that a full randomised controlled trial would not be feasible, due to failure to identify and recruit participants. We identified an unmet need to identify more effectively patients with COPD earlier in the surgical pathway. Service evaluations suggested that barriers to identification and recruitment would likely be the same across other UK hospitals. Conclusions: Although pulmonary rehabilitation is a potentially beneficial intervention to prevent post-operative pulmonary complications, a randomised controlled trial is unlikely to recruit sufficient participants to answer our study question conclusively at the present time, when spirometry is not automatically conducted in all patients planned for surgery. As pulmonary rehabilitation is a recommended treatment for all people with COPD, alternative study methods combined with earlier identification of candidate patients in the surgical pathway should be considered.

453,"Mathematical modeling of directed acyclic graphs to explore competing causal mechanisms underlying epidemiological study data","Accurately estimating the effect of an exposure on an outcome requires understanding how variables relevant to a study question are causally related to each other. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are used in epidemiology to understand causal processes and determine appropriate statistical approaches to obtain unbiased measures of effect. Compartmental models (CMs) are also used to represent different causal mechanisms, by depicting flows between disease states on the population level. In this paper, we extend a mapping between DAGs and CMs to show how DAG-derived CMs can be used to compare competing causal mechanisms by simulating epidemiological studies and conducting statistical analyses on the simulated data. Through this framework, we can evaluate how robust simulated epidemiological study results are to different biases in study design and underlying causal mechanisms. As a case study, we simulated a longitudinal cohort study to examine the obesity paradox: the apparent protective effect of obesity on mortality among diabetic ever-smokers, but not among diabetic never-smokers. Our simulations illustrate how study design bias (e.g., reverse causation), can lead to the obesity paradox. Ultimately, we show the utility of transforming DAGs into in silico laboratories within which researchers can systematically evaluate bias, and inform analyses and study design.","Havumaki, J.; Eisenberg, M.",20191005,"Epidemiology","10.1101/19007922",1,"Marisa Eisenberg","University of Michigan","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19007922v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19007922v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nd",NA,"The datasets and code used for the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

Design: We prospectively recruited 115 adults with CHB, over a period of one year at a university hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. HIV coinfection was present in 39 (34%) subjects. We recorded cross-sectional demographic, clinical and laboratory data. Results: Adults with HBV monoinfection were comparable to those with HBV/HIV coinfection in terms of age, sex and body mass. HBeAg-positive status was more common among those with HIV coinfection (p=0.01). However, compared to HBV/HIV coinfection, HBV monoinfected patients were less likely to have had assessment with elastography (p<0.0001) and less likely to be on antiviral treatment (p<0.0001). The HBV monoinfected group was more likely to have detectable HBV viraemia (p=0.04), and features suggesting underlying liver disease including moderate/severe thrombocytopaenia (p=0.007), elevated bilirubin (p=0.004), and APRI score >2 (p=0.02). Three cases of hepatocellular carcinoma were documented, all in patients with HBV monoinfection. Conclusion: In this setting, individuals with HBV monoinfection are disadvantaged in terms of clinical assessment and appropriate antiviral therapy compared to those with HIV coinfection, associated with relatively worse liver health.

437,"Optimizing the deployment of ultra-low volume and indoor residual spraying for dengue outbreak response","Recent years have seen rising incidence of dengue and large outbreaks of Zika and chikungunya, which are all caused by viruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. In most settings, the primary intervention against Aedes-transmitted viruses is vector control, such as indoor, ultra-low volume (ULV) spraying. Targeted indoor residual spraying (TIRS) has the potential to more effectively impact Aedes-borne diseases, but its implementation requires careful planning and evaluation. The optimal time to deploy these interventions and their relative epidemiological effects are not well understood, however. We used an agent-based model of dengue virus transmission calibrated to data from Iquitos, Peru to assess the epidemiological effects of these interventions under differing strategies for deploying them. Specifically, we compared strategies where spray application was initiated when incidence rose above a threshold based on incidence in recent years to strategies where spraying occurred at the same time(s) each year. In the absence of spraying, the model predicted 361,000 infections [inter-quartile range (IQR): 347,000 - 383,000] in the period 2000-2010. The ULV strategy with the fewest median infections was spraying twice yearly, in March and October, which led to a median of 172,000 infections [IQR: 158,000 - 183,000] over the 11-year study period, a 52% reduction from baseline. Compared to spraying once yearly in September, the best threshold-based strategy utilizing ULV had fewer median infections (254,000 vs. 261,000), but required more spraying (351 vs. 274 days). For TIRS, the best strategy was threshold-based, which led to the fewest infections of all strategies tested (9,900; [IQR: 8,720 - 11,400], a 94% reduction), and required fewer days spraying than the equivalent ULV strategy (280). Although spraying twice each year is likely to avert the most infections, our results indicate that a threshold-based strategy can become an alternative to better balance the translation of spraying effort into impact, particularly if used with a residual insecticide.","Cavany, S.

432,"A Personalized Multi-Component Lifestyle Intervention Program Leads to Improved Quality of Life in Persons with Chronic Kidney Disease","Introduction: Lifestyle interventions have been shown to produce favorable changes in some health outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, few such studies, employing real world methods have been completed in patients with CKD. Objective: This study tested the effectiveness of a comprehensive, multicomponent, lifestyle intervention, delivered through individualized counseling on a variety of health outcomes in pre-dialysis CKD patients. Methods: Eligible patients were assigned randomly to the intervention (TR) or usual care group (UC). A six-month home-based program involving personalized counseling to increase physical activity to recommended levels among stage G3a to G4 CKD patients while exchanging plant proteins for animal proteins was implemented. Physical function, cardiovascular function, dietary intake, medication use, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) were assessed at baseline and after 1-month, 3-months (M3) and 6-months (M6). Results: Forty-two, patients (age 60.2 {+/-} 9.2, BMI 34.5 {+/-} 7.8) participated in this study (TR=27 UC=15). The intervention reduced (p<0.05) brachial (bSBP) and central systolic blood pressures (cSBP) at month 3 (M3) but both were attenuated at month 6 (M6). Scores on the effect of kidney disease subscale of the HRQOL measure improved in the intervention group at M3 and M6. There was no change in the other measures of HRQOL or in any physical function scores.

454,"Safety of Flexible Sigmoidoscopy in Pregnant Patients with known or suspected Inflammatory Bowel Disease","I. Background and Aims Lower gastrointestinal endoscopy is the gold standard for the diagnosis and staging of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). However, there is limited safety data in pregnant populations, resulting in conservative society guidelines and practice patterns favoring diagnostic delay. The aim of this study is to investigate if the performance of flexible sigmoidoscopy is associated with adverse events in pregnant patients with known or suspected IBD. II. Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) between April 2008 and April 2019. Female patients aged between 18 and 48 years who were pregnant at the time of endoscopy were identified. All patient records were reviewed to determine disease, pregnancy course, and lifestyle factors. Two independent reviewers performed the data abstraction. Adverse events were assessed for temporal relation (defined as within 4 weeks) with endoscopy. Any discrepancies in the two reviewers' data were reviewed by a third independent investigator. Descriptive statistics of data were calculated, and comparison of continuous and categorical data were made using a one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Fisher's exact test, respectively. III. Results We report the outcomes of 48 pregnant patients across all trimesters who underwent lower endoscopy for suspected or established IBD. There were no hospitalizations or adverse obstetric events temporally associated with sigmoidoscopy. 78% of patients experienced a change in treatment following sigmoidoscopy. 12% of the patients with known IBD were found to have no endoscopic evidence of disease activity despite symptoms. IV. Conclusions Lower endoscopy in the pregnant patient with known or suspected IBD is low risk and affects therapeutic decision making. It should not be delayed in patients with appropriate indications.","Ko, M. S.; Rudrapatna, V.

452,"Can the impact of childhood adiposity on disease risk be reversed? A Mendelian randomization study","Objective: To evaluate whether early life adiposity has an independent effect on later life disease risk or whether its influence is mediated by adulthood body mass index (BMI). Design: Two-sample univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization. Setting: The UK Biobank (UKB) prospective cohort study and four large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) consortia. Participants: 453,169 participants enrolled in the UKB and a combined total of over 700,000 individuals from different GWAS consortia. Exposures: Measured BMI during adulthood (mean age: 56.5) and self-reported adiposity at age 10. Main outcome measures: Coronary artery disease (CAD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), breast cancer and prostate cancer. Results: Individuals with genetically predicted higher BMI in early life had increased odds of CAD (OR:1.49, 95% CI:1.33-1.68) and T2D (OR:2.32, 95% CI:1.76-3.05) based on univariable MR (UVMR) analyses. However, there was little evidence of a direct effect (i.e. not via adult BMI) based on multivariable MR (MVMR) estimates (CAD OR:1.02, 95% CI:0.86-1.22, T2D OR:1.16, 95% CI:0.74-1.82). In the MVMR analysis of breast cancer risk, there was strong evidence of a protective direct effect for early BMI (OR:0.59, 95% CI:0.50-0.71), although adult BMI did not appear to have a direct effect on this outcome (OR:1.08, 95% CI:0.93-1.27). Adding age of menarche as an additional exposure provided weak evidence of a total causal effect (UVMR OR:0.98, 95% CI:0.91-1.06) but strong evidence of a direct causal effect, independent of early and adult BMI (MVMR OR:0.90, 95% CI:0.85-0.95). Weak evidence of a causal effect was observed in the MVMR analysis of prostate cancer (early life BMI OR:1.06, 95% CI:0.81-1.40, adult BMI OR:0.87, 95% CI:0.70-1.08). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that increased CAD and T2D risk attributed to early life adiposity can be mitigated if individuals reduce their weight in later life. However, having a low BMI during childhood may increase risk of breast cancer regardless of changes to weight in later life, with timing of puberty also putatively playing an important role.","Richardson, T.

449,"Potential impact of outpatient stewardship interventions on antibiotic exposures of bacterial pathogens","The relationship between antibiotic stewardship and population levels of antibiotic resistance remains unclear. In order to better understand changes in selective pressure due to stewardship, we use publicly available data to estimate the effect of changes in prescribing on exposures to frequently used antibiotics experienced by potentially pathogenic bacteria that are asymptomatically colonizing the microbiome. We quantify this impact under four hypothetical stewardship strategies. In one scenario, we estimate that elimination of all unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use could avert 6 to 48% (IQR: 17 to 31%) of exposures across pairwise combinations of sixteen common antibiotics and nine bacterial pathogens. Across all scenarios, we find that successful stewardship interventions, facilitated by changes in clinician behavior and improved diagnostics, have the opportunity to substantially reduce exposures across a wide range of antibiotic-organism combinations. Concurrent approaches, such as vaccines aiming to reduce infection incidence, are needed to decrease exposures occurring in 'necessary' contexts.","Tedijanto, C.; Grad, Y.

511,"Classifying post-traumatic stress disorder using the magnetoencephalographic connectome and machine learning","Given the subjective nature of conventional diagnostic methods for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), an objectively measurable biomarker is highly desirable. Macroscopic neural circuits measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG) has previously been shown to be indicative of the PTSD phenotype and severity. In the present study, we employed a machine learning-based classification framework using MEG neural synchrony to distinguish combat-related PTSD from trauma-exposed controls. Support vector machine (SVM) was used as the core classification algorithm. A recursive random forest feature selection step was directly incorporated in the nested SVM cross validation process (CV-SVM-rRF-FS) for identifying the most important features for PTSD classification. For the five frequency bands tested, the nested CV-SVM-rRF-FS analysis selected the minimum numbers of edges per frequency that could serve as a PTSD signature and be used as the basis for SVM modelling. Many of the selected edges have been reported previously to be core in PTSD pathophysiology, with frequency-specific patterns also observed. Furthermore, the independent partial least squares discriminant analysis suggested low bias in the nested CV-SVM-rRF-FS process. The final SVM models built with selected features showed excellent PTSD classification performance (area-under-curve value up to 0.9). Testament to its robustness when distinguishing individuals from a heavily-traumatised control group, these developments for a classification model for PTSD also provide a comprehensive machine learning-based computational framework for classifying other mental health challenges using MEG connectome profiles.","Zhang, J.; Richardson, J.

558,"Predicting the required pre-surgery blood volume in surgical patients based on machine learning","Precisely predicting the required pre-surgery blood volume (PBV) in surgical patients is a formidable challenge in China. Inaccurate estimation is associate with excessive costs, postponed surgeries and adverse outcome after surgery due to in sufficient supply or inventory. This study aimed to predict required PBV based on machine learning techniques. 181,027 medical documents over 6 years were cleaned and finally obtained 92,057 blood transfusion records. The blood transfusion and surgery related factors of perioperative patients, surgeons experience volumes and the actual volumes of transfused RBCs were extracted. 6 machine learning algorithms were used to build prediction models. The surgery patients received allogenic RBCs or without transfusion, had total volume less than 10 units, or had the latest laboratory examinations of pre-surgery within 7 days were included, providing 118,823 data points. 39 predictive factors related to the RBCs transfusion were identified. Random forest model was selected to predict the required PBV of RBCs with 72.9% accuracy and strikingly improved the accuracy by 30.4% compared with surgeons experience, where 90% of data was used for training. We tested and demonstrated that both the data-driven models and the random forest model achieved higher accuracy than surgeons experience. Furthermore, we developed a computational tool, PTRBC, to precisely estimate the required PBV in surgical patients and we believe this tool will find more applications in assisting clinician decisions, not only confined to making accurate pre-surgery blood requirement predicting.","Li, R.; Han, X.; Sun, L.; Feng, Y.; Sun, X.; He, X.; Zhang, Y.; Zhu, H.; Zhao, D.; Dai, C.; He, Z.; Chen, S.; Wang, X.; Li, W.; Chi, X.; Yu, Y.; Niu, B.; Wang, D.",20191019,"Hematology","10.1101/19008045",1,"Beifang Niu","Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008045v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008045v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"If you want to use the data in this article, please contact the corresponding author for permission."
471,"Molecular Epidemiology, Diagnostics and Mechanisms of Antibiotic Resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex in Africa: A Systematic Review of Current Reports","Background: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a main global public health problem. However, a systematic review of TB resistance epidemiology in Africa is wanting. Methods: A comprehensive systematic search of PubMed, Web of Science and ScienceDirect for English research articles reporting on the molecular epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex resistance in Africa from January 2007 to December 2018 was undertaken. Results and conclusion: Qualitative and quantitative synthesis were respectively undertaken with 232 and 186 included articles, representing 32 countries. TB monoresistance rate was highest for isoniazid (59%) and rifampicin (27%), particularly in Zimbabwe (100%), Swaziland (100%), and Sudan (67.9%) whilst multidrug resistance (MDR) rate was substantial in Zimbabwe (100%), Sudan (34.6%), Ivory Coast (24.5%) and Ethiopia (23.9%). Resistance-conferring mutations were commonly found in katG (n=3694), rpoB (n=3591), rrs (n=1272), inhA (n=1065), pncA (n=1063) and embB (n=705) in almost all included countries: S315G/I/N/R/T, V473D/F/G/I, Q471H/Q/R/Y, S303C/L etc. in katG; S531A/F/S/G, H526A/C/D/G, D516A/E/G etc. in rpoB; A1401G, A513C etc. in rrs; C15T, G17A/T, -A16G etc. in inhA; Ins456C, Ins 172G, L172P , C14R, Ins515G etc in pncA. Commonest lineages and families such as T (n=8139), LAM (n=5243), Beijing (n=5471), Cameroon (n=3315), CAS (n=2021), H (n=1773) etc., with the exception of T, were not fairly distributed; Beijing, Cameroon and CAS were prevalent in South Africa (n=4964), Ghana (n=2306), and Ethiopia/Tanzania (n=799/635) respectively. Resistance mutations were not lineage-specific and sputum (96.2%) were mainly used for diagnosing TB resistance using the LPA (38.5%), GeneXpert (17.2%), whole-genome sequencing (12.3%) and PCR/amplicon sequencing (9%/23%). Intercountry spread of strains were limited while intra-country dissemination was common. TB resistance and its diagnosis remain a major threat in Africa, necessitating urgent action to contain this global menace.","Osei Sekyere, J.; Reta, M. A.; Maningi, N. E.; Fourie, P.

470,"Setting Standards to Promote Artificial Intelligence in Colon Mass Endoscopic Sampling","Artificial intelligence (AI) has undeniable values in detection, characterization, and monitoring of tumors during cancer imaging. However, major AI explorations in digestive endoscopy have not been systematically planned, and more important, most AI productions are based on Single-center Studies (ScSs). ScSs result in data scarcity, redundancy as well as island effects, which leads to some limitations in applying it on endoscopy. Current investigation aggregates a total of 2,500 gastroenteroscopy samples from various hospitals in multiple regions and carries out deep learning. It is found that factors inconducive to AI recognition are common such as: (a) the gastrointestinal tract is not cleaned up completely; (b) shooting angle (from left to right and the top of polyp are unexposed clearly), shooting distance (too close or too far to shoot causes the lump to be unclear), shooting light (insufficient light source or overexposed light source in mass) and unstable shooting lead to poor quality of pictures. We set standards based on the disadvantages of pictures which afterwards are uesd for AI robots and some improvements are found in the recognition accuracy. We set standards for a multicenter cooperation involving three-level medical institutions from the provincial, municipal and county to improve the recognition accuracy as well as the diagnosis and treatment efficiency meanwhile.","Zheng, Y.; Su, R.; Wang, W.; Meng, S.; Xiao, H.; Zhang, W.; Xu, H.; Bu, Y.; Zhong, Y.; Zhang, Y.; Qiu, H.; Qin, W.; Zhang, Y.; Xu, W.; Chen, H.; Zhang, C.; Wu, S.; Han, Z.; Zheng, X.; Zhu, H.; Wu, S.; Pan, W.; He, Y.; Hu, Y.",20191008,"Oncology","10.1101/19008078",1,"Yiqun Hu","Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008078v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008078v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"Data would be available upon requests to corresponding authors."
461,"Forecasting Seizure Risk over Days","For persons with epilepsy, much suffering stems from the apparent unpredictability of seizures. Historically, efforts to predict seizures have sought to detect changes in brain activity in the seconds to minutes preceding seizures (pre-ictal period), a timeframe that limits preventative interventions. Recently, converging evidence from studies using chronic intracranial electroencephalography revealed that brain activity in epilepsy has a robust cyclical structure over hours (circadian) and days (multidien). These cycles organize pro-ictal states, hours- to days-long periods of heightened seizure risk, raising the possibility of forecasting seizures over horizons longer than the pre-ictal period. Here, using cEEG from 18 subjects, we developed point-process generalized linear models incorporating cyclical variables at multiple time-scales to show that seizure risk can be forecasted accurately over days in most subjects. Personalized risk-stratification days in advance of seizures is unprecedented and may enable novel preventative strategies.","Proix, T.; Truccolo, W.; Leguia, M. G.; King-Stephens, D.; Rao, V.

515,"How do World and European Standard Populations impact Burden of Disease studies? A case study of Disability-Adjusted Life Years in Scotland","Background: Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) are an established method for quantifying population health needs and guiding prioritisation decisions. Global Burden of Disease (GBD) estimates aim to ensure comparability between countries and over time by using age-standardised rates (ASR) to account for differences in the age structure of different populations. Different standard populations are used for this purpose but it is not widely appreciated that the choice of standard may affect not only the resulting rates but also the rankings of causes of DALYs. We aimed to evaluate the impact of the choice of standard, using the example of Scotland. Methods: Estimates of DALYs were derived from the 2016 Scottish Burden of Disease (SBOD) study for an abridged list of 68 causes of disease/injury, representing a three-year annual average across 2014-16. Crude rates of DALYs were calculated using Scottish national population estimates. ASR of DALYs standardised using the GBD World Standard Population (GBD WSP) were compared to those using the 2013 European Standard Population (ESP2013). Differences in ASR and in rank order within the cause list were summarised across all-causes and for each individual cause. Results: The ranking of causes by DALYs were similar using crude rates or ASR (ESP2013). As expected, rates using ASR (GBD WSP) were around 26% lower. Overall 58 out of 68 causes had a lower ASR using GBD WSP compared with ESP2013, with the largest falls occurring for leading causes of mortality observed in older ages. Gains in ASR were much smaller in scale and largely affected causes that operated early in life. These differences were associated with a substantial change to the ranking of causes when GBD WSP was used compared with ESP2013. Conclusion: Disease rankings based on ASR of DALYs are strongly influenced by the choice of standard population. While GBD WSP offers international comparability, within-country analyses based on ASR of DALYs should reflect local age structures. For European countries including Scotland ESP2013 may better reflect local disease patterns.","Wyper, G. M.; Grant, I.; Fletcher, E.; Mccartney, G.; Fischbacher, C.; Stockton, D.

433,"Primary motor cortex has independent representations for ipsilateral and contralateral arm movements but correlated representations for grasping","Motor commands for the arms and hands generally originate in contralateral motor cortex anatomically. However, ipsilateral primary motor cortex shows activity related to arm movement despite the lack of direct connections. The extent to which the activity related to ipsilateral movement is independent from that related to contralateral movement is unclear based on conflicting conclusions in prior work. Here we present the results of bilateral arm and hand movement tasks completed by two human subjects with intracortical microelectrode arrays implanted in left primary motor cortex for a clinical brain-computer interface study. Neural activity was recorded while they attempted to perform arm and hand movements in a virtual environment. This enabled us to quantify the strength and independence of motor cortical activity related to continuous movements of each arm. We also investigated the subjects' ability to control both arms through a brain-computer interface system. Through a number of experiments, we found that ipsilateral arm movement was represented independently of, but more weakly than, contralateral arm movement. However, the representation of grasping was correlated between the two hands. This difference between hand and arm representation was unexpected, and poses new questions about the different ways primary motor cortex controls hands and arms.","Downey, J. E.; Quick, K.

525,"Targeting the centromedian thalamic nucleus for deep brain stimulation","Objectives: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the centromedian thalamic nucleus (CM) is an emerging treatment for multiple brain diseases, including the drug-resistant epilepsy Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). We aimed to improve neurosurgical targeting of the CM by (i) developing a structural MRI approach for CM visualisation, (ii) identifying the CM's neurophysiological characteristics, and (iii) mapping connectivity from CM-DBS sites using functional MRI (fMRI). Methods: Nineteen patients with LGS (mean age=28 years) underwent pre-surgical 3 tesla MRI using magnetisation-prepared 2 rapid acquisition gradient echoes (MP2RAGE) and fMRI sequences; 16 proceeded to bilateral CM-DBS implantation and intraoperative microelectrode recordings (MERs) from the thalamus. CM visualisation was achieved by highlighting intrathalamic borders on MP2RAGE using Sobel edge-detection. Mixed-effects analysis compared two MER features (spike firing rate, background noise) between ventrolateral, CM, and parafasicular nuclei. Resting-state fMRI connectivity was assessed using implanted CM-DBS electrode positions as regions-of-interest. Results: The CM appeared as a hyperintense region bordering the comparatively hypointense pulvinar, mediodorsal, and parafasicular nuclei. At the group-level, reduced spike firing and background noise distinguished CM from the ventrolateral nucleus; however, these trends were not found in 20-25% of individual MER trajectories. Areas of fMRI connectivity included basal ganglia, brainstem, cerebellum, sensorimotor/premotor and limbic cortex. Conclusions: In the largest clinical trial cohort of LGS patients undergoing CM-DBS reported to date, we show that accurate targeting of the CM is achievable using 3 tesla MP2RAGE MRI. MERs may provide additional localising features in some cases, however their utility is limited by inter-patient variability. Therapeutic effects of CM-DBS may be mediated via connectivity with brain networks that support diverse arousal, cognitive, and sensorimotor processes.","Warren, A. E. L.; Dalic, L.

469,"Implementation of nursing process in Ethiopia and its association with working environment and knowledge: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: Nursing Process is a scientific problem solving approach to direct nurses in caring for clients effectively and to improve quality of health care service. In Ethiopia the national pooled prevalence of implementation of nursing process remains unknown. Hence the objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to estimate the level of implementation of nursing process and it association with knowledge and working environment. Methods: PubMed Scopus Cochrane Library Google Scholar PsycINFO and CINAHL were systematically searched online to retrieve related articles. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guideline was followed. To investigate heterogeneity across the included studies I2 test was employed. Publication bias was examined using funnel plot and Egger regression test statistic. The random-effect model was fitted to estimate the summary effects and odds ratios (ORs). All statistical analysis was done using STATA version 14 software for windows. Results: Seven studies which comprises of 1268 participants were included in this meta-analysis. The estimated pooled prevalence of implementation of nursing process in Ethiopia was 42.44% (95% CI (36.91-47.97%)). Based on the subgroup analysis the highest implementation of nursing process was observed sample size greater than or equals to two hundred 44.69% (95% CI: 35.34, 54.04). Nurses who have been work in the stressful environment [(OR 0.41 95%CI (0.08-2.12)] and having good knowledge about nursing process [(OR 2.44 95%CI (0.34,17.34)] was not significant associated with the implementation of nursing process. Conclusion: The overall implementation of nursing process in Ethiopia is relatively low. Nurses who have been work in the stressful environment have less likely implement nursing process. On the other hand Nurses who had good knowledge on nursing process were more likely to implement nursing process. Therefore, policymakers (FMOH) and other concerned body need give special attention to improve the implementation of nursing process.

477,"Effect of a simple exercise programme on hospitalisation-associated disability in older patients: a randomised controlled trial.","Objective: Hospitalisation-associated disability (HAD, defined as the loss of ability to perform one or more basic activities of daily living [ADL] independently at discharge) is a frequent condition among older patients. The present study aimed to assess whether a simple inpatient exercise programme decreases the incidence of HAD in acutely hospitalised very old patients. Design: In this randomized controlled trial (Activity in GEriatric acute CARe, AGECAR) participants were assigned to a control or intervention (exercise) group, and were assessed at baseline, admission, discharge, and 3 months thereafter. Setting and participants: 268 patients (mean age 88 years, range 75 to 102) admitted to an acute care for elders (ACE) unit of a Public Hospital were randomized to a control (n=125) or intervention (exercise) group (n=143). Methods: Both groups received usual care, and patients in the intervention group also performed simple supervised exercises (walking and rising from a chair, for a total daily duration of ~20 min). We measured incident HAD at discharge and after 3 months (primary outcome); and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), ambulatory capacity, number of falls, re-hospitalisation and death during a 3-month follow-up (secondary outcomes). Results: Median duration of hospitalisation was 7 days (interquartile range 4 days). Compared with admission, the intervention group had a lower risk of HAD at discharge (odds ratio [OR]: 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.11, 0.92) and at 3-months follow-up (OR 0.24; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.74) than controls during follow-up. No intervention effect was noted for the other secondary endpoints (all p>0.05), although a trend towards a lower mortality risk was observed in the intervention group (p=0.078). Conclusion and implications: These findings demonstrate that a simple inpatient exercise programme significantly decreases the risk of HAD in acutely hospitalised, very old patients.","Ortiz-Alonso, J.; Bustamante-Ara, N.; Valenzuela, P.

606,"Operationalizing Occupational Fatigue in Pharmacists: An Exploratory Factor Analysis","Introduction: The Quadruple Aim recognizes that caring for the healthcare employee is necessary to optimize patient outcomes and health system performance. Although previous research has assessed pharmacists' workload, this study is the first to describe pharmacist occupational fatigue - a characteristic of excessive workload that inhibits workers' abilities to function at normal capacity. The purpose of this study was to describe occupational fatigue in pharmacists using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) - assessing whether dimensional structures used to describe occupational fatigue in other health professions fit pharmacist perceptions. Methods: A model was created to conceptualize ""fatigue"" domains found in the literature. A priori, the two domains identified were physical fatigue (ex. physical discomfort), and mental fatigue (ex. trouble thinking clearly). These domains were operationalized and used to create a paper survey that was distributed to licensed pharmacists at a pharmacy conference. An EFA was conducted to identify the key domains underlying pharmacist perceptions of fatigue. Results: A total of 283 surveys were distributed and 115 were returned and usable. Respondents were primarily white, female, worked 9.52 hours-per-day on average, and mean age of 39-years-old. The EFA suggested a statistically significant two-factor model ({chi}^2 9.73, p=0.28; TLI 0.998, RMSEA 0.048), which included physical fatigue ( = 0.87) and mental fatigue ( = 0.82). Discussion: The EFA yielded a structure similar to what was anticipated from the literature with physical and mental fatigue dimensions. This is just the first step in promoting systematic interventions to prevent or cope with fatigue and prevent the downstream patient, pharmacist, and institutional outcomes. By addressing fatigue and caring for employees, health care systems can take steps to work toward the Quadruple Aim.","Watterson, T.

478,"DyeVer PLUS EZ system for Preventing Contrast-Induced Acute Kidney Injury in Patients Undergoing Diagnostic Coronary Angiography and/or Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: A UK-Based Cost-Utility Analysis","Background: Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is a complication commonly associated with invasive angiographic procedures and is considered the leading cause of hospital-acquired acute kidney injury. CI-AKI can lead to a prolonged hospital stay, with a substantial economic impact, and increased mortality. The DyeVert PLUS EZ system (FDA approved and CE marked) is a device that has been developed to divert a portion of the theoretical injected contrast media volume (CMV), reducing the overall injected contrast media and aortic reflux and potentially improving long-term health outcomes. Objectives: To assess the long-term costs and health outcomes associated with the introduction of the DyeVert PLUS EZ system into the health care service for the prevention of CI-AKI in a cohort of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3-4 undergoing Diagnostic Coronary Angiography (DAG) and/or Percutaneous Coronary intervention (PCI), compared with current practice. Methods: A de novo economic model was developed based on the current pathway of managing patients undergoing DAG and/or PCI and on evidence related to the clinical effectiveness of DyeVert, in terms of its impact on relevant clinical outcomes and health service resource use. Clinical data used to populate the model were derived from the literature or were based on assumptions informed by expert clinical input. Costs included in the model were obtained from the literature and UK-based routine sources. Probabilistic distributions were assigned to the majority of model parameters so that a probabilistic analysis could be undertaken, while deterministic sensitivity analyses were also carried out to explore the impact of key parameter variation on the model results. Results: Base-case results indicate that the intervention leads to cost savings (- 3,878) and improved effectiveness (+ 0.02 QALYs) over the patients lifetime, compared with current practice. Output from the probabilistic analysis supports the high likelihood of the intervention being cost-effective across presented willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds. The overall long-term cost saving for the NHS associated with introduction of the intervention for each cohort of patients is over 175 million. The cost savings are mainly driven by lower risk of subsequent diseases and associated costs Conclusions: Introduction of the DyeVer PLUS EZ system has the potential to reduce costs for the health care service and lead to improved clinical outcomes for patients with CKD stage 3-4 undergoing angiographic procedures.","Javanbakht, M.; Rezaie Hemami, M.; Mashayekhi, A.; Branagan-Harris, M.",20191008,"Health Economics","10.1101/19008185",1,"Mehdi Javanbakht","Optimax Access","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008185v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008185v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"All data are publicly available"
520,"Synthetic apparent diffusion coefficient for high b-value diffusion weighted MRI in Prostate","Purpose: It has been reported that diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) with ultrahigh b-value increases the diagnostic power of prostate cancer. DWI imaging with higher b-values is challenging as it commonly suffers from low signal to noise ratio (SNR), distortion and longer scan time. The aim of our study was to develop a technique for quantification of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) for higher b-values from lower b-value DW images. Materials and Methods: Fifteen patient (7 malignant, 8 benign) with prostate cancer were included in this study retrospectively with the institutional ethical committee approval. All images were acquired at 3T MR scanner. The ADC values were calculated using mono-exponential model. Synthetic ADC (sADC) for higher b-value were computed using a log-linear model. Contrast ratio (CR) between prostate lesion and normal tissue on synthetic DWI (sDWI) was computed and compared with original DWI and ADC images. Results: No significant difference was observed between actual ADC and sADC for b-2000 in all prostate lesions. However; CR increased significantly (p=0.002, paired t-test) in sDWI as compared to DWI. Malignant lesions showed significantly lower sADC as compared to benign lesion (p=0.0116, independent t-test). Mean ( {+/-} standard deviation) of sADC of malignant lesions was 0.601 {+/-} 0.06 and for benign lesions was 0.92 {+/-} 0.09 (10-3mm2/s). Discussion / Conclusion: Our initial investigation suggests that the ADC values corresponding to higher b-value can be computed using log-linear relationship derived from lower b-values (b [&le;] 1000). Our method might help clinician to decide the optimal b-value for prostate lesion identification.","Sahoo, P.; Rockne, R. C.; Alexander, J.; Gupta, P. K.; Gupta, R.

499,"Molecular point-of-care testing for influenza A/B and respiratory syncytial virus: comparison of workflow parameters for the ID Now and cobas Liat systems","Aims: Point-of-care (POC) tests for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) offer the potential to improve patient management and antimicrobial stewardship. Studies have focused on performance; however, no workflow assessments have been published comparing POC molecular tests. This study compared the Liat and ID Now systems workflow, to assist end-users in selecting an influenza and/or RSV POC test. Methods: Staffing, walk-away, and turnaround time (TAT) of the Liat and ID Now systems were determined using 40 nasopharyngeal samples, positive for influenza or RSV. The ID Now system requires separate tests for influenza and RSV, so parallel (two instruments) and sequential (one instrument) workflows were evaluated. Results: The ID Now ranged 4.1-6.2 minutes for staffing, 1.9-10.9 minutes for walk-away and 6.4-15.8 minutes for TAT per result. The Liat ranged 1.1-1.8 minutes for staffing, 20.0-20.5 minutes for walk-away and 21.3-22.0 minutes for TAT. Mean walk-away time comprised 38.0% (influenza positive) and 68.1% (influenza negative) of TAT for ID Now and 93.7% (influenza/RSV) for Liat. The ID Now parallel workflow resulted in medians of 5.9 minutes for staffing, 9.7 minutes for walk-away, and 15.6 minutes for TAT. Assuming prevalence of 20% influenza and 20% RSV, the ID Now sequential workflow resulted in medians of 9.4 minutes for staffing, 17.4 minutes for walk-away, and 27.1 minutes for TAT. Conclusions: The ID Now and Liat systems offer different workflow characteristics. Key considerations for implementation include value of both influenza and RSV results, clinical setting, staffing capacity, and instrument(s) placement.","Young, S.; Phillips, J.; Christen Griego-Fullbright, C.; Wagner, A.; Jim, P.; Chaudhuri, S.; Tang, S.; Sickler, J.",20191010,"Infectious Diseases","10.1101/19008227",1,"Stephen Young","TriCore Reference Laboratories, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008227v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008227v1.full.pdf","cc_no","10.1136/jclinpath-2019-206242","Data are available upon reasonable request.

482,"The Causal Effects of Health Conditions and Risk Factors on Social and Socioeconomic Outcomes: Mendelian Randomization in UK Biobank","Objectives: To estimate the causal effect of health conditions and risk factors on social and socioeconomic outcomes in UK Biobank. Evidence on socioeconomic impacts is important to understand because it can help governments, policy-makers and decision-makers allocate resources efficiently and effectively. Design: We used Mendelian randomization to estimate the causal effects of eight health conditions (asthma, breast cancer, coronary heart disease, depression, eczema, migraine, osteoarthritis, type 2 diabetes) and five health risk factors (alcohol intake, body mass index [BMI], cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, smoking) on 19 social and socioeconomic outcomes. Setting: UK Biobank. Participants: 337,009 men and women of white British ancestry, aged between 39 and 72 years. Main outcome measures: Annual household income, employment, deprivation (measured by the Townsend deprivation index [TDI]), degree level education, happiness, loneliness, and 13 other social and socioeconomic outcomes. Results: Results suggested that BMI, smoking and alcohol intake affect many socioeconomic outcomes. For example, smoking was estimated to reduce household income (mean difference = -24,394, 95% confidence interval (CI): -33,403 to -15,384), the chance of owning accommodation (absolute percentage change [APC] = -21.5%, 95% CI: -29.3% to -13.6%), being satisfied with health (APC = -32.4%, 95% CI: -48.9% to -15.8%), and of obtaining a university degree (APC = -73.8%, 95% CI: -90.7% to -56.9%), while also increasing deprivation (mean difference in TDI = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.64, approximately 236% of a decile of TDI). There was evidence that asthma increased deprivation and decreased both household income and the chance of obtaining a university degree, and migraine reduced the chance of having a weekly leisure or social activity, especially in men. For other associations, estimates were null. Conclusions: Higher BMI, alcohol intake and smoking were all estimated to adversely affect multiple social and socioeconomic outcomes. Effects were not detected between health conditions and socioeconomic outcomes using Mendelian randomization, with the exceptions of depression, asthma and migraines. This may reflect true null associations, selection bias given the relative health and age of participants in UK Biobank, and/or lack of power to detect effects.","Harrison, S.; Davies, A.

480,"Distance to white matter trajectories is associated with treatment response to internal capsule deep brain stimulation in treatment-resistant depression","Objective: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an innovative treatment for treatment-resistant depression. DBS is usually targeted at specific anatomical landmarks, with patients responding to DBS in approximately 50% of cases. Attention has recently shifted to white matter tracts to explain DBS response, with initial open-label trials targeting white matter tracts yielding much higher response rates (>70%). Methods: We associated distance to individual white matter tracts around the stimulation target in the ventral anterior limb of the internal capsule to treatment response. We performed diffusion magnetic resonance tractography of the superolateral branch of the medial forebrain bundle and the anterior thalamic radiation in fourteen patients that participated in our randomized clinical trial. We combined the tract reconstructions with the postoperative images to identify the DBS leads and estimated the distance between tracts and leads, which we subsequently associated with treatment response. Results: Stimulation closer to both tracts was significantly correlated to a larger symptom decrease (r=0.61, p=0.02), suggesting that stimulation more proximal to the tracts was beneficial. There was no difference in lead placement with respect to anatomical landmarks, which could mean that differences in treatment response were driven by individual differences in white matter anatomy. Conclusions: Our results suggest that deep brain stimulation of the ventral anterior limb of the internal capsule could benefit from targeting white matter bundles. We recommend acquiring diffusion magnetic resonance data for each individual patient.","Liebrand, L. C.; Natarajan, S. J.; Caan, M. W. A.; Schuurman, P.

527,"Sugar or Salt (SOS): a protocol for a UK multicentre randomised trial of mannitol and hypertonic saline in severe traumatic brain injury and intracranial hypertension","Hyperosmolar solutions are widely used to treat raised intracranial pressure (ICP) following severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Although mannitol has historically been the most frequently administered, hypertonic saline (HTS) solutions are increasingly being used. However, definitive evidence regarding their comparative effectiveness is lacking. The Sugar or Salt (SOS) Trial is a UK randomised, allocation concealed open label multicentre pragmatic trial designed to determine the clinical and cost-effectiveness of hypertonic saline (HTS) compared with mannitol in the management of patients with severe TBI. Patients requiring intensive care unit admission and intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring post-TBI will be allocated at random to receive equi-osmolar boluses of either mannitol or HTS following failure of routine first line measures to control ICP. The primary outcome for the study will be the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) assessed at 6 months after randomisation. Results will inform current clinical practice in the routine use of hyperosmolar therapy as well as assess the impact of potential side effects. Pre-planned longer term clinical and cost effectiveness analyses will further inform the use of these treatments.","Rowland, M. J.; Veenith, T.; Scomparin, C.; Wilson, M. H.; Hutchinson, P.

513,"Analysis of online information available for treatment of depression","The Internet has become a prime source of health information available to the public. Our aims were to assess the content and quality of online information for the treatment of depression. We searched, 'How to cure depression' on Google and analysed the first 200 websites according to the website typology and a standard health information assessment tool, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) criteria (presence of authorship, date, disclosure, and references). We also analyzed content in terms of treatments mentioned and developed a Quality Indicator Score (QIS) based on the guidelines for treating depression from the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). News websites were the most frequent typology followed by health portals, non-profit, professional and government; commercial websites were the least represented. In the top ten websites, news and health portals remained first and second respectively. Antidepressants were the most mentioned treatment, followed by psychotherapy, lifestyle & exercise, social support, diet. The least mentioned interventions were sunlight & light therapy, routine, and ketamine & psychedelics. Commercial websites preferentially mentioned supplements, while ketamine and psychedelic drugs were the most covered by news outlets. Analysing webpages according to our QIS showed the median of NICE recommended treatments was 2.5 out of 5 possible treatments: antidepressants, lifestyle & exercise, psychotherapy, social support and ECT. Government websites had the highest QIS, news and commercial websites the lowest.

476,"Diagnosing Cornelia de Lange syndrome and related neurodevelopmental disorders using RNA-sequencing","Neurodevelopmental phenotypes represent major indications for children undergoing clinical exome sequencing. However, up to 50% of cases remain undiagnosed even upon periodic exome reanalysis. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can boost diagnostic yield in neuromuscular diseases, but its utility in neurodevelopmental disorders is hampered out of concern for sourcing relevant tissue for RNA analysis. Here we show human B lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) share the transcriptional repertoire of brain tissue for a large subset of neurodevelopmental Mendelian genes, enabling testing of over 1000 genetic syndromes. LCLs also showed a 1.8-fold increase in the number of genes causing neurodevelopmental phenotypes when compared to whole blood (LCL, n = 1706; whole blood, n = 917) indicating a more robust testing landscape. We applied an RNA-seq diagnostic pipeline on LCLs from patients with Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), a rare multisystem neurodevelopment disorder and found 100% sensitivity for detection of abnormal splicing and 90% sensitivity for detecting all pathogenic events. Application of the pipeline on unsolved cases of CdLS revealed abnormal splicing and pathogenic coding variants in NIPBL and BRD4. This work demonstrates that the LCL transcriptome enables broad, frontline or reflexive, diagnostic testing for neurodevelopmental disorders.","Rentas, S.; Rathi, K.; Kaur, M.; Raman, P.; Krantz, I.; Sarmady, M.; Abou Tayoun, A.",20191008,"Genetic And Genomic Medicine","10.1101/19008300",1,"Ahmad Abou Tayoun","Al Jalila Children\'s Specialty Hospital","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008300v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008300v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd","10.1038/s41436-019-0741-5","All data can be available upon request"
485,"APOE interacts with tau PET to influence memory independently of amyloid PET","Objective: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) interacts with AD pathology to promote disease progression. Studies of APOE risk primarily focus on amyloid, however, and little research has assessed its interaction with tau pathology independent of amyloid. The current study investigated the moderating effect of APOE genotype on independent associations of amyloid and tau PET with cognition. Methods: Participants included 297 older adults without dementia from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Regression equations modeled associations between cognitive domains and (1) cortical A{beta} PET levels adjusting for tau PET and (2) medial temporal lobe (MTL) tau PET levels adjusting for A{beta} PET, including interactions with APOE {varepsilon}4 carrier status. Results: Adjusting for tau PET, A{beta} was not associated with cognition and did not interact with {varepsilon}4 status. In contrast, adjusting for A{beta} PET, MTL tau PET was significantly associated with all cognitive domains. Further, there was a moderating effect of {varepsilon}4 status on MTL tau and memory with the strongest negative associations in {varepsilon}4 carriers and at high levels of tau. This interaction persisted even among only A{beta} negative individuals. Interpretation: APOE {varepsilon}4 genotype strengthens the negative association between MTL tau and memory independently of A{beta}, although the converse is not observed, and this association may be particularly strong at high levels of tau. These findings suggest that APOE may interact with tau independently of A{beta} and that elevated MTL tau confers negative cognitive consequences in A{beta} negative {varepsilon}4 carriers.","Weigand, A.

484,"Towards a brain signature of chronic pain using cerebral blood flow spatial covariance analysis in people with chronic knee pain","Chronic musculoskeletal pain is a common problem globally. Current evidence suggests that maladaptive modulation of central pain pathways is associated with pain chronicity following e.g. chronic post-operative pain after knee replacement. Other factors such as low mood, anxiety and tendency to catastrophize seem to also be important contributors. We aimed to identify a chronic pain brain signature that discriminates chronic pain from pain-free conditions using cerebral blood flow (CBF) measures, and explore how this signature relates to the chronic pain experience. In 44 chronic knee pain patients and 29 pain-free controls, we acquired CBF data (using arterial spin labelling) and T1-weighted images. Participants completed a series of questionnaires related to affective processes, and pressure and cuff algometry to assess pain sensitization. Two factor scores were extracted from these scores representing negative affect and pain sensitization, respectively. A spatial covariance principal components analysis of CBF identified five components that significantly discriminated chronic pain patients from controls, with the unified network achieving 0.83 discriminatory accuracy (area under the curve). In chronic knee pain, significant patterns of relative hypo-perfusion were evident in anterior regions of the default mode and salience network hubs, while hyperperfusion was seen in posterior default mode regions, the thalamus, and sensory regions. One component was positively correlated to the pain sensitization score (r=.43, p=.006), suggesting that this CBF pattern reflects the neural activity changes encoding pain sensitization. Here, we report the first chronic knee pain-related brain signature, pointing to a brain signature underpinning the central aspects of pain sensitisation.","Iwabuchi, S. J.; Xing, Y.; Cottam, W.

This is despite substantial evidence suggesting that early diagnosis and intervention improves developmental course and outcome. Objective: Develop a machine learning (ML) method predicting the diagnosis of ASD in offspring in a general population sample, using parental electronic medical records (EMR) available before childbirth Design: Prognostic study of EMR data within a single Israeli health maintenance organization, for the parents of 1,397 ASD children (ICD-9/10), and 94,741 non-ASD children born between January 1st, 1997 through December 31st, 2008. The complete EMR record of the parents was used to develop various ML models to predict the risk of having a child with ASD. Main outcomes and measures: Routinely available parental sociodemographic information, medical histories and prescribed medications data until offspring's birth were used to generate features to train various machine learning algorithms, including multivariate logistic regression, artificial neural networks, and random forest. Prediction performance was evaluated with 10-fold cross validation, by computing C statistics, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, false positive rate, and precision (positive predictive value, PPV). Results: All ML models tested had similar performance, achieving an average C statistics of 0.70, sensitivity of 28.63%, specificity of 98.62%, accuracy of 96.05%, false positive rate of 1.37%, and positive predictive value of 45.85% for predicting ASD in this dataset. Conclusion and relevance: ML algorithms combined with EMR capture early life ASD risk. Such approaches may be able to enhance the ability for accurate and efficient early detection of ASD in large populations of children.","Rahman, R.; Kodesh, A.; Levine, S.

486,"Real-world Drug Regimens for Multiple Myeloma in a Swiss Population (2012 to 2017): cost-outcome description","Background: Novel drugs are dynamically changing current treatment regimens for multiple myeloma (MM). Novel drugs have improved prognosis of MM patients in clinical studies but are expensive. Little is known about up-to-date real-world application and costs. Methods: We performed a retrospective observational cohort analysis (cost-outcome description; 2012-2017) in a claims database of a major Swiss health insurance company which covers 14% of the Swiss population (Helsana Versicherungen AG). We used primary (MM diagnoses via ICD-10) and secondary features (prescribed MM-specific drugs) as inclusion criteria and defined a hierarchy of drug regimens to classify treatments as: 1) proteasome inhibitor (PI)-based regimen (e.g. bortezomib); 2) IMID-based regimen (e.g. lenalidomide); 3) chemotherapy (CHEMO)-based regimen (e.g. bendamustin); 4) monoclonal antibody (MAB)-based regimen (e.g. daratunumab). Direct medical costs of mandatory health insurance were analysed in 2017 Swiss Francs (CHF; third party payer perspective). Results: Overall, we identified n=1054 prevalent MM patients (2012-2017) and n=378 incident MM patients (2015-2017; men: 47.1%; age group <=75 years: 48.7%). The number of prevalent patients per year increased over time (from n=314 in 2012 to n=645 in 2017). PI-based regimens were the most frequent first line approach for incident patients (76.0%), followed by IMID-based (21.9%) and CHEMO-based regimens (2.1%). Only four patients were treated with MAB-drugs. For later lines, IMID-based regimens were most often used (2nd line: 56.4%; 3rd line: 2 of 3 patients), followed by PI-based regimens (43.6% and 1 of 3 patients, respectively). 161 of 1054 prevalent MM patients (15.3%) were treated with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), 4 patients with allogeneic HSCT. Average costs per patient per treatment line varied considerably (reliable data available from 2012 to 2014; mean duration of lines between 112 and 388 days): PI-based regimens: CHF 81352; IMID-based: CHF 73495; CHEMO-based: CHF 683. Mean daily costs under MM treatment stepwise increased from CHF 209 in 2012 to CHF 254 in 2017 (relative increase: 21.5%). Annual direct medical costs in Switzerland for seven novel MM drugs were extrapolated to be 60.1 Mio CHF in 2012 and 118.6 Mio CHF in 2017 (relative increase: 97.3%), corresponding to mean annual outpatient MM drug costs per patient of CHF 28000 in 2017. Annual death rates decreased systematically from 18.6% in 2012 to 15.5% in 2017 (p for trend: 0.03). No statistically significant difference in death rates emerged for 2017 compared with 2012 (risk ratio: 0.83; 95%-CI: 0.63 to 1.10; absolute risk reduction: 3.1%). Conclusions: Current treatment patterns for MM patients in Switzerland show variation concerning applied drug regimens as well as costs. An increasing prevalent population of MM patients in combination with increasing costs per day under treatment lead to a substantial and growing budget impact for the Swiss social insurance system.","Eichler, K.; Rapold, R.; Wieser, S.; Reich, O.; Blozik, E.",20191008,"Oncology","10.1101/19008383",1,"Klaus Eichler","Winterthur Institute of Health Economics, Zurich University of Applied Sciences","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008383v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008383v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"The health insurance claims data as used for our analysis are stored at Helsana Versicherungen AG, Switzerland.

522,"Patient Preferences to Undergo Low-Value CT Coronary Angiography in the Emergency Department","Background: Low-value diagnostic testing adds billions of dollars to the cost of health care in the US annually. Addressing patient preference for these tests is one possible strategy to limit overuse. In previous work, we showed that patient preference for testing can be influenced by test benefit, risk, and financial measures. Our objective was to examine the effect of these variables in another clinical scenario involving chest pain. Methods: In this cross-sectional survey of patients at the University of Michigan Emergency Department (ED), participants were given a hypothetical scenario involving an ED visit for chest pain, along with information regarding potential benefit (detecting a life-threatening condition; 0.1 or 1%) and risk (developing cancer; 0.1 or 1%) of CTCA, as well as an incentive of $0 or $100 to forego testing. Values for risk, benefit, and financial incentive varied across participants. Our primary outcome was patient preference to undergo testing. We also obtained demographic and numeracy information. Then, we used logistic regression to estimate odds ratios, adjusting for multiple potential confounders. Our sample size was designed to find at least 300 events (test acceptance) to allow for up to 30 covariates in fully adjusted models. We had 85-90% power to detect a 10% absolute difference in testing rate across groups, assuming a 95% significance level. Results: 913 patients were surveyed. A $100 financial incentive (adjusted OR [AOR] 0.57; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.42-0.78) and increased test risk (AOR 0.61; 95% CI 0.44-0.84) both significantly decreased test acceptance in fully adjusted models, whereas increased test benefit significantly increased test acceptance (AOR 2.45; 95% CI 1.79-3.36). Conclusions: Offering a financial incentive deterred patients from accepting testing despite varying levels of risk and benefit. In the context of previous work, we provide preliminary evidence supporting that financial interventions may impact patient preference more than test risk and benefit.","Winkels, J.

560,"The role of prison-based interventions for hepatitis C virus (HCV) micro-elimination among people who inject drugs in Montreal, Canada","Background: In Canada, hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission primarily occurs among people who inject drugs (PWID) and people with experience in the prison system bear a disproportionate HCV burden. These overlapping groups of individuals have been identified as priority populations for HCV micro-elimination in Canada, a country currently not on track to achieve its elimination targets. Considering the missed opportunities to intervene in provincial prisons, this study aims to estimate the population-level impact of prison-based interventions and post-release risk reduction strategies on HCV transmission among PWID in a high HCV-burdened Canadian city, Montreal. Methods: A dynamic HCV transmission model among PWID was developed and calibrated to community and prison bio-behavioural surveys in Montreal. Then, the relative impact of prison-based testing and treatment or post-release linkage to care, alone or in combination with risk reduction strategies, was estimated from 2018 to 2030, and compared to a counterfactual status quo scenario. Results: Testing and linkage to care interventions implemented over 2018-30 could lead to the greatest declines in prevalence (23%; 95% credible interval (CrI): 17-31%), incidence (20%; 95%CrI: 10-28%), and prevent the most new chronic infections (8%; 95%CrI: 4-11%). Testing and treatment in prison lead to slightly lower decreases in prevalence, incidence, and fraction of prevented new chronic infections. Combining test and linkage to care with risk reduction measures could further its epidemiological impact, preventing 10% (95%CrI: 5-16%) of new chronic infections. When implemented concomitantly with community-based treatment scale-up, prison-based interventions had synergistic effects, averting a higher fraction of new chronic infections. Conclusion: Offering HCV testing and post-release linkage to care in provincial prisons, where incarcerations are frequent and sentences short, could change the course of the HCV epidemic in Montreal. Integration of post-release risk reduction measures and community-based treatment scale-up could significantly increase the impact of these interventions.","Godin, A.; Kronfli, N.; Cox, J.; Alary, M.; Maheu-Giroux, M.",20191021,"Health Policy","10.1101/19008409",1,"Arnaud Godin","McGill University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008409v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008409v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc","10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.102738","Online supplemental material is available with specification on model structure and methods for model calibration.

451,"Quantifying the success of measles vaccination campaigns in the Rohingya refugee camps","In the wake of the Rohingya population's mass migration from Myanmar, one of the world's largest refugee settlements was constructed in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh to accommodate nearly 900,000 new refugees. Refugee populations are particularly vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks due to many population and environmental factors. A large measles outbreak, with over 2,500 cases, occurred among the Rohingya population between September and December 2017. Here, we estimate key epidemiological parameters and use a dynamic mathematical model of measles transmission to evaluate the effectiveness of the reactive vaccination campaigns in the refugee camps. We also estimate the potential for subsequent outbreaks under different vaccination coverage scenarios. Our modeling results highlight the success of the vaccination campaigns in rapidly curbing transmission and emphasize the public health importance of maintaining high levels of vaccination in this population, where high birth rates and historically low vaccination coverage rates create suitable conditions for future measles outbreaks.","Chin, T.; Buckee, C.

628,"A target product profile for electronic clinical decision support algorithms combined with point-of-care diagnostic test results to support evidence-based decisions during patient consultations by health workers","Health workers in low-resource settings often lack the support and tools to follow evidence-based clinical recommendations for diagnosing, treating and managing sick patients. Digital technologies, by combining patient health information and point of care diagnostics with evidence-based clinical protocols, can help improve the quality of care, the rational use of resources (humans, diagnostics and medicines) and save patient lives. The development of a target product profile for electronic clinical decision support algorithms (CDSAs) aimed at guiding preventive or curative consultations, and that integrate diagnostic test results will help align developer and implementer processes and specifications with the needs of end-users, in terms of quality, safety, performance and operational functionality. To identify characteristics for a CDSA, experts from academia, research institutions, and industry as well as policy makers with expertise in diagnostic and CDSA development, and implementation in LMICs were convened. Experts discussed the critical characteristics of a draft TPP which was revised and finalised through a Delphi process to facilitate consensus building. Experts were in overwhelming agreement that, given that CDSAs provide patients' management recommendations, the underlying clinical algorithms should be available in human readable format and evidence-based. Whenever possible, the algorithm output should take into account pre-test disease probabilities, diagnostic likelihood ratios of clinical or laboratory predictors and disease probability thresholds to test and to treat. Validation processes should at a minimum ensure the CDSA are implementing faithfully the evidence-based algorithm they are based on (internal validation through clinical association and analytical validation). Additionally, clinical validation, bringing practice evidence about the impact of the CDSA use on health outcomes, was recognized as a good to have. The CDSAs should be designed to fit within clinic workflows, connectivity challenges and high volume settings. Data collected through the tool should conform to local patient privacy regulations and international data standards.","Pelle, K.

489,"Living alone, loneliness and lack of emotional support as predictors of suicide and self-harm: seven-year follow up of the UK Biobank cohort","Background: The association between loneliness and suicide is complex, poorly understood, and there are no prior longitudinal studies. We aimed to investigate the relationship between living alone, loneliness and emotional support as predictors of death by suicide and self-harm. Methods: Between 2006 and 2010 UK Biobank recruited over 0.5m people aged 37-73. This data was linked to prospective hospital admission and mortality records. Adjusted Cox regression models were used to investigate the relationship between self-reported measures of loneliness, emotional support and living arrangements and death by suicide and self-harm. Results: For women, there was no evidence that living arrangements, loneliness or lack of emotional support were associated with death by suicide. However, for men, both living alone (Hazard Ratio (HR) 2.19 95%CI 1.47-3.27) and with non-partners (HR 2.17 95%CI 1.28-3.69) were associated with death by suicide, independently of loneliness, which had a modest relationship with suicide in men (HR 1.45 95%CI 0.99-2.12). Associations between living alone and self-harm were explained by health for women, and by health, loneliness and emotional support for men. In fully adjusted models, loneliness was associated with hospital admissions for self-harm in both women (HR 1.90 95%CI 1.58-2.29) and men (HR 1.75 95%CI 1.41-2.18). Conclusions: For men -but not for women- living alone or with a non-partner increased the risk of suicide, a finding not explained by loneliness. Loneliness may be more important as a risk factor for self-harm than for suicide, and appears to mitigate against any protective effect of cohabitation.","Shaw, R.

488,"Joint modelling of individual trajectories, within-individual variability and a later outcome: systolic blood pressure through childhood and left ventricular mass in early adulthood","Within-individual variability of repeatedly-measured exposures may predict later outcomes: e.g. blood pressure (BP) variability (BPV) is an independent cardiovascular risk factor above and beyond mean BP. Since two-stage methods, known to introduce bias, are typically used to investigate such associations, we introduce a joint modelling approach, examining associations of both mean BP and BPV across childhood to left ventricular mass (indexed to height; LVMI) in early adulthood with data from the UK's Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort. Using multilevel models, we allow BPV to vary between individuals (a ""random effect"") as well as to depend on covariates (allowing for heteroscedasticity). We further distinguish within-clinic variability (""measurement error"") from visit-to-visit BPV. BPV was predicted to be greater at older ages, at higher bodyweights, and in females, and was positively correlated with mean BP. BPV had a positive association with LVMI (10% increase in SD(BP) was predicted to increase LVMI by mean = 0.42% (95% credible interval: -0.47%, 1.38%)), but this association became negative (mean = -1.56%, 95% credible interval: -5.01%, 0.44%)) once the effect of mean BP on LVMI was adjusted for. This joint modelling approach offers a flexible method of relating repeatedly-measured exposures to later outcomes.","Parker, R. M. A.; Leckie, G.; Goldstein, H.; Howe, L. D.; Heron, J.; Hughes, A.

487,"Inconsistent Addiction Treatment for Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery for Injection Drug Use-Associated Infective Endocarditis","Introduction: Cases of injection drug use-related infective endocarditis (IDU-IE) requiring surgery are rising in the setting of the current U.S. opioid epidemic. We thus aimed to determine the nature of addiction interventions in the perioperative period. Methods: This is a retrospective review of surgical IDU-IE from 2011 to 2016 at a tertiary care center in New Haven, Connecticut. The data collected included substances consumed recreationally, consultations by social work (SW), psychiatry, pharmacotherapy for addiction, and evidence of enrollment in a drug rehabilitation program upon discharge. Among patients with active drug use (ADU), we compared the 24-month survival of those who received at least one form of addiction intervention to that of those who did not. Results: Forty-two patients (75%) had active drug use. Among them, 22 used heroin. Forty-one patients (73.2%) saw SW, 17 (30.4%) saw psychiatry; 14 (25%) saw neither SW nor psychiatry. Twenty-one patients (37.5%) received methadone, 6 (10.7%) received buprenorphine, 1 (0.02%) received naltrexone; 26 (46.4%) did not receive any pharmacotherapy. Fifteen patients (26.8%) attended a drug rehabilitation program, 13 (86.7%) of whom had seen SW and 8 (53%) psychiatry. Among patients with ADU, there was no statistically significant difference in survival between those who received at least one intervention and those who did not (p=0.1 by log rank). Conclusion: Addiction interventions are deployed inconsistently for patients with surgical IDU-IE. Untreated substance use disorder and recurrent endocarditis are the leading cause of death in this population. Studying best-practices for perioperative interventions in IDU-IE and establishing protocols are of the upmost importance.","Nguemeni Tiako, M. J.; Hong, S.; Bin Mahmood, S.

462,"Traditional Healers as Client Advocates in the HIV-endemic Region of Maputo, Mozambique: Results from a qualitative study","Traditional healers are commonly utilized throughout sub-Saharan Africa instead of, and in concert with, biomedical facilities. Traditional healers are trusted providers and prominent community members, and could be important partners in improving engagement with HIV services in endemic contexts. Our study sought to understand the roles of healers in the urban setting of Maputo, Mozambique, where HIV prevalence is high and testing rates are low. Qualitative data were gathered through minimally-structured interviews with 36 healers. Analysis followed an inductive, grounded theory approach. Data reveal three themes relevant to improving engagement with HIV services in this endemic region: 1) healers have positive attitudes towards biomedicine; 2) healers advocate for their sick clients; and 3) clients are reticent to present to biomedical facilities. Healers describe their roles as ""cooperative"" with biomedical providers to provide healthcare for their clients. Results suggest that healers could be considered critical enablers to effective HIV programs in communities. They have social and symbolic capital that positions them to beneficially influence clients, and are natural partners for interventions to improve uptake of HIV services.","Sundararajan, R.; Langa, P.

458,"A conceptual model for pluralistic healthcare behavior: results from a qualitative study in southwestern Uganda","Introduction: Medical pluralism, or concurrent utilization of multiple therapeutic modalities, is common in various international contexts, and has been characterized as a factor contributing to poor health outcomes in low-resource settings. Traditional healers are ubiquitous providers in most regions, including the study site of southwestern Uganda. It is not well understood why patients in pluralistic settings continue to engage with both therapeutic healthcare modalities, rather than simply selecting one or the other. The goal of this study was to identify factors that motivate pluralistic healthcare utilization, and create a general, conceptual framework of pluralistic health behavior. Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted between September 2017 and February 2018 with patients seeking care at traditional healers (N=30) and at an outpatient medicine clinic (N=30) in Mbarara, Uganda; the study is nested within a longitudinal project examining HIV testing engagement among traditional healer-utilizing communities. Inclusion criteria included age 18 years or older, and ability to provide informed consent. Participants were recruited from healer practices representing the range of healer specialties. Following an inductive approach, interview transcripts were reviewed and coded to identify conceptual categories explaining healthcare utilization. Results: We identified three broad categories relevant to healthcare utilization among study participants: 1) traditional healers treat patients with ""care""; 2) biomedicine uses ""modern"" technologies; and 3) peer ""testimony"" influences healthcare engagement. These categories describe variables at the healthcare provider, healthcare system, and peer levels that interrelate to motivate individual engagement in pluralistic health resources. Conclusions: Patients perceive clear advantages and disadvantages to biomedical and traditional care in medically pluralistic settings. We identified factors at the healthcare provider, healthcare system, and peer levels which influence patients' therapeutic itineraries. Our findings provide a basis to improve health outcomes in medically pluralistic settings, and underscore the importance of recognizing traditional healers as important stakeholders in community health.","Sundararajan, R.; Mwanga-Amumpaire, J.; King, R.; Ware, N.

506,"Does your address make the grade? The relationship between local socioeconomic status and the academic performance of paramedic students.","Research indicates students of lower socioeconomic status (SES) are educationally disadvantaged. We sought to examine differences in paramedic student academic performance from counties with varying SES in the United States. Student performance data and SES data were combined for counties within the states of California, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas and Virginia. Linear multiple regression modelling was performed to determine the relationship between income, high school graduation rate, poverty and food insecurity with first-attempt scores on the Fisdap Paramedic Readiness Exam (PRE) versions 3 and 4. Linear regression models indicated that there was a significant relationship between county-level income, poverty, graduation rate, food insecurity, and paramedic student academic performance. It remains unclear what type of relationship exists between individual SES and individual academic performance of paramedic students. These findings support the future collection of individual student level SES data in order to identify issues and mitigate impact on academic performance.","Hamel, L.; Procum, A.; Hunter, J.; Gridley, D.; O'connor, K.; Fentress, T.; Goenner, C.; Khalsa, S.; Batt, A.

507,"Genome-wide investigation of DNA methylation in congenital adrenal hyperplasia","Background: Patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) are at risk of long-term cognitive and metabolic sequelae. This study investigates genome-wide DNA methylation in patients with CAH to determine whether there is evidence for epigenomic reprogramming as well as any relationship to patient outcome. Methods: We analysed CD4+ T cell DNA from 28 patients with CAH (mean age=18.5 {+/-}6.5 years [y]) and 37 population controls (mean age=17.0 {+/-}6.1 y) with the Infinium-HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array to measure genome-wide locus-specific DNA methylation levels. Effects of CAH, phenotype and CYP21A2 genotype on methylation were investigated as well as the association between differentially methylated CpGs, metabolic profiles (glucose homeostasis and blood lipid profile) and cognitive outcome. In addition, we report data on a small cohort of 11 patients (mean age=19.1, {+/-}6.0 y) with CAH who were treated prenatally with dexamethasone (DEX). Results: We identified two CpGs to be associated with patient phenotype: cg18486102 (located in the FAIM2 gene; rho=0.58, adjusted p=0.027) and cg02404636 (located in the SFI1 gene; rho=0.58, adjusted p=0.038). cg02404636 was also associated with genotype (rho=0.59, adjusted p=0.024). We did not observe any effect of DEX on DNA methylation in individuals with CAH. No significant association was found between FAIM2 methylation and cognitive or metabolic outcome. However, SFI1 TSS methylation was associated with fasting plasma HDL cholesterol levels (p=0.035). Conclusion: In conclusion, higher methylation levels in CpG sites covering FAIM2 and SFI1 were associated with disease severity. Hypermethylation in these genes may have implications for long-term cognitive and metabolic outcome in patients with CAH.","Karlsson, L.; Barbaro, M.; Ewing, E.; Gomez-Cabrero, D.; Lajic, S.",20191011,"Endocrinology","10.1101/19008524",1,"Svetlana Lajic","Karolinska Institutet","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008524v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008524v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"all data are available upon request"
692,"Disruptive and protective outcomes to memory and attention when treating diffuse glioma","Surgical resection with adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy are effective treatments to delay glioma progression and improve survival. Nevertheless, a large proportion of patients have treatment-induced cognitive deficits that dramatically reduce their life quality. Predicting the treatment-induced functional impairments is difficult due to the complex interlocking and diffusely spread networks that underpin different aspects of cognition. Here we investigated glioma interactions with brain networks in relation to cognitive recovery after surgical resection and during chemo-radiotherapy treatment. Seventeen patients with diffuse non-enhancing glioma (aged 22-56 years) were longitudinally MRI-scanned and cognitively assessed using a tablet-based screening tool before and after surgery, and during a 12-months recovery period. Using structural MRI and Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) derived from diffusion-weighted images, we respectively estimated tumour overlap and Neurite Density (as an in-vivo proxy measure of axon and dendrite concentration) with brain networks and functional maps derived from normative data in healthy participants. We found that neither total lesion volume nor tumour location based on traditional lobular divisions were associated with memory or attention deficits. However, tumour and lesion overlap with the Default Mode Network (DMN), Attention Network and attention-related regions located in frontal and parietal cortex was associated with memory and attention deficits. This association was above and beyond the contributions of preoperative cognitive status and tumour volume (Linear Mixed Model, Pfdr<0.05). On the other hand, Neurite Density was reduced not only within the tumour, but also beyond the tumour boundary, revealing a distal effect with global consequences to brain networks. High preoperative Neurite Density outside the tumour, but within the Frontoparietal Network was associated with better memory and attention recovery. Moreover, postoperative and follow-up Neurite Density within the DMN, Frontoparietal and Attention Networks were associated with memory and attention improvements (Pfdr<0.05). We conclude that gliomas located on brain networks that are fundamental for cognitive processing mediate cognitive deficits and they exert a distal effect on Neurite Density in these networks that is also associated with cognitive recovery. Our work provides insights into the brain reorganisation that occurs due to the presence of a tumour and its subsequent removal, which has potential capability to predict cognitive outcomes. Understanding the pathophysiology underlying tumour related cognitive outcomes will be vital to the development of novel prognostic biomarkers, subgroup stratification in clinical trials, and individualised rehabilitation programmes.","Romero-Garcia, R.; Suckling, J.; Owen, M.; Assem, M.; Sinha, R.; Coelho, P.; Woodberry, E.; Price, S.

495,"A Multiomics Approach to Heterogeneity in Alzheimer's Disease: Focused Review and Roadmap","Etiological and clinical heterogeneity is increasingly recognized as a common characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. This heterogeneity complicates diagnosis, treatment, and the design and testing of new drugs. An important line of research is discovery of multimodal biomarkers that will facilitate the targeting of subpopulations with homogeneous pathophysiological signatures. High-throughput  omics are unbiased data driven techniques that probe the complex etiology of Alzheimer's disease from multiple levels (e.g. network, cellular, and molecular) and thereby account for pathophysiological heterogeneity in clinical populations. This review focuses on data reduction analyses that identify complementary disease-relevant perturbations for three omics techniques: neuroimaging-based subtypes, metabolomics-derived metabolite panels, and genomics-related polygenic risk scores. Neuroimaging can track accrued neurodegeneration and other sources of network impairments, metabolomics provides a global small-molecule snapshot that is sensitive to ongoing pathological processes, and genomics characterizes relatively invariant genetic risk factors representing key pathways associated with Alzheimer's disease. Following this focused review, we present a roadmap for assembling these multiomics measurements into a diagnostic tool highly predictive of individual clinical trajectories, to further the goal of personalized medicine in Alzheimer's disease.","Badhwar, A.; Mcfall, G.

Standardized approaches for capturing reproducible and comparable biomarkers are greatly needed. Here, we propose a method, NeuroMark, which leverages a priori-driven independent component analysis to effectively extract functional brain network biomarkers from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. NeuroMark automatically estimates features adaptable to each individual and comparable across subjects by taking advantage of the replicated brain network templates extracted from 1828 healthy controls as guidance to initialize the individual-level networks. Four studies including 2454 subjects were conducted spanning six brain disorders (schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease) to evaluate the proposed method from different perspectives (replication, cross-study comparison, subtle difference identification, and multi-disorder classification).

Aims: We investigated cardiac structure and function in patients with schizophrenia using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) after excluding medical and metabolic comorbidity. Methods: 80 participants underwent CMR to determine biventricular volumes and function and measures of blood pressure, physical activity, and glycated haemoglobin levels. Patients and controls were matched for age, sex, ethnicity, and body surface area. Results: Patients with schizophrenia had significantly smaller indexed left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, stroke volume, right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume, and stroke volume but unaltered ejection fractions relative to controls. LV concentricity and septal thickness were significantly larger in schizophrenia. The findings were largely unchanged after adjusting for smoking or exercise levels and were independent of medication dose and duration.

Methods We performed a systematic review by searching Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE as well as AMED, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and clinicaltrials.gov from inception to February 2019. All studies other than case reports were eligible for inclusion if the population was younger than 18 years old, there was a surgical intervention aimed at treating extravasation injury and they reported on outcomes. Risk of bias was graded according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) study quality assessment tools. Results 26 studies involving 728 children were included. One before and after study and 25 case series. Extravasation injuries were mainly confined to skin and subcutaneous tissues but severe complications were also encountered, including amputation (one toe and one below elbow). Of the surgical treatments described, the technique of multiple puncture wounds and instillation of saline and/or hyaluronidase was the most commonly used. However, there were no studies in which its effectiveness was tested against another treatment or a control and details of functional and aesthetic outcomes were generally lacking. Conclusion There is a lack of high quality evidence to support treatment of extravasation injury in children. A definitive trial of extravasation injuries, or a centralized extravasation register using a universal grading scheme and core outcome set with adequate follow up, are required to provide evidence to guide clinician decision-making.","Little, M.; Dupre, S.; Wormald, J.; Gardiner, M.; Gale, C.; Jain, A.",20191010,"Pediatrics","10.1101/19008664",2,"Chris Gale","Neonatal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, Chelsea and Westminster Campus, London, UK, SW10 9NH","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008664v2?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008664v2.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"There is no supplementary data online.

But the efficacy and safety of this nab-paclitaxel over conventional paclitaxel still remains questionable. So, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel in breast cancer treatment. Electronic databases were searched for the suitable studies using key terms 'nab-paclitaxel', 'paclitaxel', and 'clinical trial' with the combination of 'breast cancer' up to August 11, 2019. Risk ratio (RR) and odds ratio (OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. All statistical analyses were performed by the Open Meta-Analyst program. A total of eight studies which fulfilled our criteria were included in this study. For efficacy we retrieved data of 12 months progression free survival, 24 months progression free survival, and overall survival (up to 3 years) and for the safety we took data of nausea, anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, fatigue, diarrhea and pain. We did not found any difference in efficacy of nab-paclitaxel over paclitaxel (12 months progression free survival- RRFE= 0.86, 95%CI= 0.77-0.97, p= 0.02, I2= 25.07%; 24 months progression free survival- RRFE= 0.86, 95% CI= 0.64-1.16, p= 0.34, I2= 0%; and 3 years survival- RRFE= 1.20, 95%CI= 0.92-1.56, p= 0.16, I2= 37.55%). The meta-analysis of studies used nab-paclitaxel showed reduced adverse effect of anemia (ORFE= 1.66, 95% CI= 1.26-2.19; p= <0.001; I2= 0%) and leukopenia (ORFE= 1.37; 95%CI= 1.06-1.75; p= 0.01; I2= 48.63%). However, in case of other adverse effects no significant association was found with nab-paclitaxel (nausea- ORFE=1.15, 95%CI= 0.94-1.41, p= 0.15, I2= 50.12%; neutropenia- ORRE= 0.75, 95%CI= 0.30-1.87, p= 0.54, I2= 94.45%; fatigue- ORRE= 1.11, 95%CI= 0.77-1.62, p= 0.55, I2= 56.02; diarrhea- ORFE= 1.11, 95%CI= 0.77-1.62, p= 0.55; I2= 34.26; pain- ORRE= 1.15, 95%CI= 0.78-1.69, p= 0.45, I2= 52.96%). In conclusion the use of nab-paclitaxel has reduces the side effects of anemia and leukopenia in breast cancer treatment in comparison to paclitaxel but nab-paclitaxel has no effect on the overall survival of the patients.","Yadav, U.; Kumar, P.; Rai, V.",20191016,"Oncology","10.1101/19008672",1,"Vandana Rai","VBS Purvanchal University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008672v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008672v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"All the data are included in the manuscript."
694,"Towards a differential diagnosis of cochlear synaptopathy and outer-hair-cell deficits in mixed sensorineural hearing loss pathologies","Damage to the auditory periphery is more widespread than predicted by the gold-standard clinical audiogram. Noise exposure, ototoxicity and aging can destroy cochlear inner-hair-cell afferent synapses and result in a degraded subcortical representation of sound while leaving hearing thresh- olds unaffected. Damaged afferent synapses, i.e. cochlear synaptopathy, can be quantified using histology, but a differential diagnosis in living hu- mans is difficult: histology cannot be applied and existing auditory evoked potential (AEP) metrics for synaptopathy become insensitive when other sensorineural hearing impairments co-exist (e.g., outer-hair-cell damage associated with elevated hearing thresholds). To develop a non-invasive diagnostic method which quantifies synaptopathy in humans and animals with normal or elevated hearing thresholds, we employ a computational model approach in combination with human AEP and psychoacoustics. We propose the use of a sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) map which comprises two relative AEP-based metrics to quantify the respective de- grees of synaptopathy and OHC damage and evaluate to which degree our predictions of AEP alterations can explain individual data-points in recorded SNHL maps from listeners with normal or elevated audiometric thresholds. We conclude that SNHL maps can offer a more precise diag- nostic tool than existing AEP methods for individual assessment of the synaptopathy and OHC-damage aspect of sensorineural hearing loss.","Vasilkov, V.; Verhulst, S.",20191105,"Otolaryngology","10.1101/19008680",2,"Sarah Verhulst","Ghent University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008680v2?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008680v2.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"Data available from author upon reasonable request"
514,"Mechanistic insights into heterogeneous radiofrequency ablation effects at the left atrial posterior wall during pulmonary vein isolation","Background: Independent investigations demonstrate greater radiofrequency (RF) ablation effects at left-sided left atrial posterior wall (LAPW) sites. Objective: To investigate mechanisms underlying RF ablation heterogeneity during contact-force (CF) and VISITAG Module (Biosense Webster)-guided pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). Methods: Consecutive patients undergoing PVI during atrial overdrive pacing comprised 2 cohorts: intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV, 14-16/min, 6-8ml/kg); high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV, 150/min, Monsoon III, Acutronic). Temperature-controlled (17ml/min, 48oC) RF data was retrospectively assessed at first-annotated (target 15s) LAPW sites: 30W during IPPV; 20W at left-sided sites during HFJV. Results: Twenty-five and 15 patients underwent PVI during IPPV and HFJV, respectively. During IPPV, left versus right-sided median impedance drop (ImpD) was 13.6{Omega} versus 9.9{Omega} (p<0.0001) respectively and mean time to pure R unipolar electrogram (UE) morphology change 4.9s versus 6.7s (p=0.007) respectively. During HFJV, ImpD was greater at left-sided sites (9.7{Omega} versus 7.4{Omega}, p=0.21) and time to pure R UE significantly shorter: 4.3s versus 6.1s (p=0.02). Minimum case impedance subtracted from pre-RF baseline impedance (BI) generated site-specific {Delta}BI. Left-sided sites demonstrated significantly greater {Delta}BI, correlating strongly with Ln(ImpD) - IPPV r=0.84 (0.65 - 0.93), HFJV r=0.77 (0.35 - 0.93). At right-sided sites, {Delta}BI and Ln(ImpD) were without correlation during IPPV, but correlation was modest during HFJV (r=0.54, -0.007 - 0.84). Conclusions: {Delta}BI may usefully indicate catheter-tissue contact surface area (SA). Consequently, greater left-sided LAPW RF effect may result from greater contact SA and in-phase catheter-tissue motion; HFJV may reduce right-sided out-of-phase catheter-tissue motion. Modifying RF delivery based on {Delta}BI may improve PVI safety and efficacy.","Tomlinson, D.

539,"A Markov Chain approach for ranking treatments in network meta-analysis","When interpreting the relative effects from a network meta-analysis (NMA), researchers are usually aware of the potential limitations that may render the results for some comparisons less useful or meaningless. In the presence of sufficient and appropriate data, some of these limitations (e.g. risk of bias, small-study effects, publication bias) can be taken into account in the statistical analysis. Very often, though, the necessary data for applying these methods are missing and data limitations cannot be formally integrated into ranking. In addition, there are other important characteristics of the treatment comparisons that cannot be addressed within a statistical model but only through qualitative judgements; for example, the relevance of data to the research question, the plausibility of the assumptions, etc. Here, we propose a new measure for treatment ranking called the Probability of Selecting a Treatment to Recommend (POST-R). We suggest that the order of treatments should represent the process of considering treatments for selection in clinical practice and we assign to each treatment a probability of being selected. This process can be considered as a Markov chain model that allows the end-users of NMA to select the most appropriate treatments based not only on the NMA results but also to information external to the NMA. In this way, we obtain rankings that can inform decision-making more efficiently as they represent not only the relative effects but also their potential limitations. We illustrate our approach using a NMA comparing treatments for chronic plaque psoriasis and we provide the Stata commands.","Chaimani, A.; Porcher, R.; Sbidian, E.; Mavridis, D.",20191018,"Epidemiology","10.1101/19008722",1,"Anna Chaimani","Universite de Paris, Research Center of Epidemiology and Statistics Sorbonne Paris Cite (CRESS-UMR1153), INSERM, INRA, F-75004 Paris, France","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008722v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008722v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"The data are available upon request."
537,"Trends and variation in prescribing of suboptimal statin treatment regimes: a cohort study in English primary care","Objectives: We set out to describe trends and variation in statin prescribing in England that breaches 2014 national guidance on ""high-intensity"" statins. We identify factors associated with breaching; and assess the feasibility of rapid prescribing behaviour change. Design, Setting and Participants: Retrospective cohort study in NHS primary care in England, including all 8,142 standard general practices from August 2010 to March 2019. Main Outcome Measures: We categorised statins as high or low/medium-intensity based on two different thresholds, and calculated the proportion prescribed below these thresholds across all practices. We plotted trends and geographical variation, carried out mixed effects logistic regression to identify practice characteristics associated with breaching guidance, and used indicator saturation to identify practices exhibiting sudden changes in prescribing. Results: We included all 8,142 practices across the study period. The proportion of statin prescriptions below the recommended 40% LDL-lowering threshold decreased gradually since 2012 from 80% to 45%; the proportion below a pragmatic 37% threshold decreased from 30% to 18%. The 2014 guidance had minimal impact on these trends. We found wide variation between practices (interdecile ranges 20% to 85% and 10% to 30% respectively in 2018). Mixed effects logistic regression did not identify practice characteristics strongly associated with breaching guidance. Indicator saturation identified several practices exhibiting sudden changes in prescribing towards greater guideline compliance. Conclusions: Breaches of English guidance on choice of statin remain common, with substantial variation between GP practices. Some practices and regions have implemented rapid change, indicating the feasibility of rapid prescribing behaviour change. We discuss the potential for a national strategic approach, using data and evidence to optimise care, including targeted education alongside audit and feedback to outliers through services such as OpenPrescribing.","Curtis, H.

475,"Clinical Impact of Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing of Plasma Cell-Free DNA for the Diagnosis of Infectious Diseases: A Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study","Background: Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of plasma cell-free DNA has emerged as an attractive diagnostic modality allowing broad-range pathogen detection, noninvasive sampling, and earlier diagnosis. However, little is known about its real-world clinical impact as used in routine practice. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients for whom plasma mNGS (Karius test) was performed for all indications at 5 U.S. institutions over 1.5 years. Comprehensive chart review was performed, and standardized assessment of clinical impact of the mNGS based on the treating team interpretation of Karius results and patient management was established. Results: A total of 82 Karius tests were evaluated, from 39 (47.6%) adults and 43 (52.4%) children and a total of 53 (64.6%) immunocompromised patients. Karius positivity rate was 50/82 (61.0%), with 24 (48.0%) showing two or more organisms (range, 2-8). The Karius test results led to positive impact in 6 (7.3%), negative impact in 3 (3.7%), no impact in 70 (85.4%), and was indeterminate in 3 (3.7%). Cases with positive Karius result and clinical impact involved bacteria and/or fungi but not DNA viruses or parasites. In 10 patients who underwent 16 additional repeated tests, only one was associated with clinical impact. Conclusions: The real-world impact of the Karius test as currently used in routine clinical practice is limited. Further studies are needed to identify high-yield patient populations, define the complementary role of mNGS to conventional microbiological methods, and how best to integrate mNGS into current testing algorithms.","Hogan, C.

529,"Implications of MGMT promoter methylation and its downstream hMSH2 mRNA in primary malignant glioma","Background: Hypermethylation of 06-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter seen in high grade gliomas (HGG) leads to the accumulation of O6-meG DNA damage which mispairs with thymine, requiring recognition by mismatch repair protein dimer MutS, whose primary component is coded by Human MutS homolog protein 2 (hMSH2). O6-meG repair necessitates the interaction/combined action of MGMT and hMSH2 to maintain genomic stability. Analysis of the correlation between MGMT methylation and hMSH2 mRNA expression in HGG and their role in the prognosis was explored. Methods: Study was performed on 54 primary-frontal lobe HGG tumors, MGMT promoter methylation was detected by Q-MSP and Q-PCR was used to analyze hMSH2 m-RNA expression levels. Results: MGMT methylation was seen in 62% patients the mean percentage of methylation (PoM) being (17.62{+/-}17.20) %. MGMT PoM [&ge;]10% had improved Progression free survival (p=0.015) and [&ge;]8% had better Overall survival (p=0.043), indicating its predictive significance. Over expression of hMSH2 was seen in 50% patients with a median fold change of 2.74 (p=0.021). Univariate analysis of high hMSH2 expression with therapy (CT+RT) showed poor PFS (p=0.002). There was no correlation between MGMT methylation and hMSH2 expression. Conclusion: MGMT PoM of [&ge;]10% is a significant prognostic marker. Over expression of hMSH2 is prognostic marker for poor treatment response. Lack of/aberrant correlation between MGMT and hMSH2 could indicate impaired DNA repair of O6-meG in HGG, and this could be one of the factors responsible for both, gliomagenesis and variations in treatment response.","Manuel, J.; K V L, N.

536,"Investigation of an estimate of daily resting heart rate using a consumer wearable device","Resting heart rate is accepted as a valid overall indicator of cardiovascular risk and is a low-cost easy-to-measure metric that can be collected in both home and clinical settings. Wearable devices such as smartwatches and trackers can measure heart rate continuously using optical technology. This study reports initially on the agreement between the resting heart rate reported by a wearable device (Fitbit Charge HR and Fitbit Blaze) and a chest-based consumer electrocardiogram (Polar H7). In 45 subjects, the reported resting heart rates agreed within 0.89 bpm over a resting period of 5 mins. The same device and algorithm was then used in a population of 168 subjects (45.9 {+/-} 15.6 yrs) who were asked to collect their resting heart rate for four days under seven different conditions and times (at wake sitting/lying down, pre-breakfast, pre-lunch, pre-dinner, and before bed sitting/lying down). The reported values were compared with the Daily Resting Heart Rate (DRHR) reported by the wearable device. The measurement lying down before wake were closest to the DRHR (mean error of 0.0 bpm with a 25-75th percentile spread of {+/-}3.5bpm. There was a significant circadian variation in the reported resting heart rate across subjects, with the highest values reported in the middle of the day. Within individual subjects, the median standard deviation of heart rate at rest was 3-5bpm even measured under nominally similar conditions over four days.","Heneghan, C.; Venkatraman, S.; Russell, A.",20191018,"Cardiovascular Medicine","10.1101/19008771",1,"Conor Heneghan","Fitbit","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008771v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008771v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"Interested researchers can contact the authors for data availability"
632,"Implicit and explicit motor learning interventions have similar effects on walking speed in people after stroke: a randomized controlled single blind trial","Background: Therapists may use (more) implicit or (more) explicit motor learning approaches to facilitate motor skill learning of stroke patients. The use of implicit motor learning approaches has shown promising results in healthy populations. Objective: To assess whether an implicit motor learning walking intervention is more effective compared to an explicit motor learning walking intervention delivered at home with regard to walking speed in people after stroke in the chronic phase of recovery. Design: Randomized controlled single blind trial. Setting: Home environment. Patients: 79 people in the chronic phase after stroke (66.4{+/-}11.0 years; 70.1{+/-}64.3 months after stroke; walking speed 0.7{+/-}0.3 m/s; Berg Balance Scale score 44.5{+/-}9.5) were randomly assigned to an implicit (n=39) or explicit (n=41) group. Intervention: Analogy learning was used as the implicit motor learning walking intervention, whereas the explicit motor learning walking intervention consisted of detailed verbal instructions. Both groups received nine training sessions, 30 minutes each, for a period of three weeks. Measurements: The primary outcome was walking speed measured by the 10-Meter Walk Test. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline, immediate and 1-month post intervention. Results: No statistically or clinically relevant differences between groups were obtained post intervention (between-group difference estimated 0.02 m/s [95% CI -0.04 to 0.08] and at follow-up (between-group difference estimated -0.02 m/s [95% CI -0.09 to 0.05], p=0,563). Limitations: The treatment effects may have been diluted by ''noise'' accompanied with research within real life settings, complex tasks and a representative sample. Conclusions: Implicit motor learning was not superior to the explicit motor learning to improve walking speed in people after stroke in the chronic phase of recovery.","Jie, L.-J.; Kleynen, M.; Meijer, K.; Beurskens, A.; Braun, S.",20191102,"Rehabilitation Medicine And Physical Therapy","10.1101/19008797",1,"Li-Juan Jie","Zuyd University of Applied Sciences","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008797v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008797v1.full.pdf","cc_by",NA,"The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author, upon reasonable request."
562,"Spatial versus angular resolution for tractography-assisted planning of deep brain stimulation","Given the restricted total scanning time for clinical neuroimaging, it is unclear whether clinical diffusion MRI protocols would benefit more from higher spatial resolution or higher angular resolution. In this work, we investigated the relative benefit of improving spatial or angular resolution in diffusion MRI to separate two parallel running white matter tracts that are targets for deep brain stimulation: the anterior thalamic radiation and the supero-lateral branch of the medial forebrain bundle. Both these tracts are situated in the ventral anterior limb of the internal capsule, and recent studies suggest that targeting a specific tract could improve treatment efficacy. Therefore, we scanned 19 healthy volunteers at 3T and 7T according to three diffusion MRI protocols with respectively standard clinical settings, increased spatial resolution of 1.4 mm, and increased angular resolution (64 additional gradient directions at b=2200s/mm2). We performed probabilistic tractography for all protocols and quantified the separability of both tracts. The higher spatial resolution protocol improved separability by 41% with respect to the clinical standard, presumably due to decreased partial voluming. The higher angular resolution protocol resulted in increased apparent tract volumes and overlap, which is disadvantageous for application in precise treatment planning. We thus recommend to increase the spatial resolution for deep brain stimulation planning to 1.4 mm while maintaining angular resolution. This recommendation complements the general advice to aim for high angular resolution to resolve crossing fibers, confirming that the specific application and anatomical considerations are leading in clinical diffusion MRI protocol optimization.","Liebrand, L.; Van Wingen, G.

568,"Estimating Real World Performance of a Predictive Model: A Case-Study in Predicting End-of-Life","Objective: The main criteria for choosing how models are built is the subsequent effect on future (estimated) model performance. In this work, we evaluate the effects of experimental design choices on both estimated and actual model performance. Materials and Methods: Four years of hospital admissions are used to develop a 1 year end-of-life prediction model. Two common methods to select appropriate prediction timepoints (backwards-from-outcome and forwards-from-admission) are introduced and combined with two ways of separating cohorts for training and testing (internal and temporal). Two models are trained in identical conditions, and their performances are compared. Finally, operating thresholds are selected in each test set and applied in a final, 'real-world' cohort consisting of one year of admissions. Results: Backwards-from-outcome cohort selection discards 75% of candidate admissions (n=23,579), whereas forwards-from-admission selection includes many more (n=92,148). Both selection methods produce similar global performances when applied to an internal test set. However, when applied to the temporally defined 'real-world' set, forwards-from-admission yields higher areas under the ROC and precision recall curves (88.3 and 56.5% vs. 83.2 and 41.6%). Discussion: A backwards-from-outcome experiment effectively transforms the training data such that it no longer resembles real-world data. This results in optimistic estimates of test set performance, especially at high precision. In contrast, a forwards-from-admission experiment with a temporally separated test set consistently and conservatively estimates real-world performance. Conclusion: Experimental design choices impose bias upon selected cohorts. A forwards-from-admission experiment, validated temporally, can conservatively estimate real-world performance.","Major, V.

532,"The importance of adolescent girls and \""epidemic gearing\"" on HIV prevalence across West Africa","Background: In West Africa HIV prevalence varies between 0.1-6% in female and between 0.1-4% in the male general population. Male circumcision is almost universal, and it is unclear what drives this variation. We use mathematical modelling to identify the determinants of this variation across fourteen West African countries. Methods: We developed a novel dynamic model of HIV transmission between population cohorts of female sex workers (FSWs), their clients, females with 2+ partners in the past year and other sexually active women and men in the general population. Parameter ranges were determined from the literature and sampled using Latin Hypercube sampling to identify parameter sets that fit West African HIV prevalence data. Partial-rank correlation coefficients between different model parameters and the HIV prevalence in general male and female population across 14 countries were calculated to determine to most significantly correlated model parameters to HIV prevalence. Results: The key determinant of HIV in females when prevalence is between 0-3% is the size of the brothel and non-brothel FSW groups. When female HIV prevalence >3%, the percentage of sexually active adolescent females with 2+ partners has greater influence on HIV prevalence. The size of the FSW groups has the most significant impact on HIV prevalence for males. Conclusions: Our findings confirm the role of FSWs in West Africa as an important determinant of HIV risk, but also identify, in countries with higher HIV prevalence, the emerging role of a group of adolescent girls with 2+ partners is an important determinant of risk. In fact, our findings suggest that this group may enable the epidemic to be effectively ""geared up"" when partnerships are formed with higher-risk males, indicating additional prevention needs amongst this group.

541,"Mosquito exposure and malaria morbidity; a micro-level analysis of household mosquito populations and malaria in a population-based longitudinal cohort in western Kenya","Background: Malaria morbidity is highly overdispersed in the population. Fine-scale differences in mosquito exposure may partially explain this heterogeneity. However, exposure variability has not been related to individual malaria outcomes. Methods: We established a cohort of 38 households to explore the effect of household-level mosquito exposure and individual insecticide treated net(ITN) use on relative risk(RR) of diagnostically-confirmed malaria. We conducted monthly active surveillance (n=254; 2,624 person-months) and weekly mosquito collection in all households (2,092 household-days of collection). We used molecular techniques to confirm human blood feeding and exposure to infectious mosquitoes. Results: Of 1,494 female anopheles (89.8% Anopheles gambiae s.l.). 88.3% were fed, 51.9% had a human bloodmeal, and 9.2% were sporozoite-infected. 168 laboratory-confirmed malaria episodes were reported (incidence rate 0.064 episodes per person-month at risk, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.055,0.074). Malaria risk was directly associated with exposure to sporozoite-infected mosquitoes (RR=1.24, 95%CI:1.11,1.38). No direct effect was measured between ITN use and malaria morbidity, however, ITN use did moderate the effect of mosquito exposure on morbidity. Conclusions: Malaria risk increases linearly with vector density and feeding success for persons with low ITN use. In contrast, malaria risk among high ITN users is consistently low and insensitive to variation in mosquito exposure.","Prudhomme O'meara, W.; Simmons, R.; Bullins, P.; Freedman, B.; Abel, L.; Mangeni, J.; Taylor, S.

Its predictive value has not been validated on large cohorts with long term follow up. The objective of this work is to independently evaluate the prognostic value of the RCB index depending on BC subtypes (Luminal, HER2 positive and triple negative (TNBCs)). Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the RCB index on surgical specimens from a cohort of T1T3NxM0 BC patients treated with NAC between 2002 and 2012. We analyzed the association between RCB index and relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS) among the global population, after stratification by BC subtypes. Results: 717 patients were included (luminal BC (n = 222, 31%), TNBC (n = 319, 44.5%), HER2 positive (n = 176, 24.5%)). After a median follow up of 99.9 months, RCB index was significantly associated with RFS. The RCB0 patients displayed similar prognosis when compared to the RCBI group, while patients from the RCBII and RCBIII classes were at increased risk of relapse (RCBII versus RCB0: HR=3.25 CI [2.1;5.1] p < 0.001; RCBIII versus RCB0: HR=5.6 CI [3.5;8.9] p < 0.001). The prognostic impact of RCB index was significant for TNBC and HER2 positive cancers; but not for luminal cancers (Pinteraction = 0.07). The prognosis of RCBIII patients was poor (8 years RFS: 52.7%, 95% CI [44.8 ; 62.0]) particularly in the TNBC subgroup, where the median RFS was 12.7 months. Conclusion: RCB index is a reliable prognostic score. RCB accurately identifies patients at a high risk of recurrence (RCBIII) with TNBC or HER2 positive BC who must be offered second-line adjuvant therapies.","Hamy, A.-S.; Darrigues, L.; Laas, E.; De Croze, D.; Topciu, L.; Lam, G.-T.; Evrevin, C.; Rozette, S.; Laot, L.; Lerebours, F.; Pierga, J.-Y.; Osdoit, M.; Faron, M.; Feron, J.-G.; Lae, M.; Reyal, F.",20191011,"Oncology","10.1101/19008896",1,"Fabien Reyal","Institut Curie Paris","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008896v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008896v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request."
563,"German Recommendations for Physical Activity and Physical Activity Promotion in Adults with Noncommunicable Diseases","Background: The objective of this study was to develop evidence-based recommendations for physical activity (PA) and PA promotion for German adults (18-65 years) with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). Methods: The PA recommendations were developed based on existing PA recommendations and using a three-phased process. In phase 1, systematic literature searches were conducted for current PA recommendations for seven chronic conditions (osteoarthrosis of the hip and knee, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stable ischemic heart disease, stroke, clinical depression, and chronic non-specific back pain). In phase 2, the PA recommendations were evaluated on the basis of 28 quality criteria. High-quality recommendations were identified, and a content analysis was conducted on these recommendations. In phase 3, the findings of the content analysis were summarised, and PA recommendations for seven chronic conditions were deducted. The seven recommendations were then synthesised to generate generic German PA recommendations for adults with noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). In relation to the recommendations for PA promotion, a systematic literature review was conducted on papers that reviewed the efficacy/effectiveness of interventions for PA promotion in adults with NCDs. Results: The German Recommendations for Physical Activity state that adults with NCDs should, over the course of a week, should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic PA, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic PA, or a combination of both. Furthermore, muscle-strengthening activities should be performed at least twice a week. The promotion of PA among adults with NCDs should be theory-based, specifically target PA behaviour, and be tailored to the respective target group. In this context, and as an intervention method, exercise referral schemes are one of the more promising methods of promoting PA in adults with NCDs. Conclusion: The development of evidence-based recommendations for PA and PA promotion is an important step in terms of the initiation and implementation of actions for PA-related health promotion in Germany. The German Recommendations for PA and PA promotion inform adults affected by NCDs and health professionals on how much PA would be optimal for adults with NCDs. Additionally, the recommendations provide professionals entrusted in PA promotion the best strategies and interventions to raise low PA levels in adults with NCDs. The formulation of specific PA recommendations for adults with NCDs and their combination with recommendations on PA promotion is a unique characteristic of the German recommendations.","Geidl, W.; Abu-Omar, K.; Weege, M.; Messing, S.; Pfeifer, K.",20191022,"Public And Global Health","10.1101/19008953",1,"Wolfgang Geidl","Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuernberg","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008953v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19008953v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd","10.1186/s12966-020-0919-x","Not applicable"
548,"The prevalence and risk factors for phantom limb pain in people with amputations: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","Background and objective Phantom limb pain (PLP) is a common complication in people with limb amputations. There are conflicting reports in the literature regarding the prevalence of PLP in people with limb amputations. Therefore, this review aimed to determine the estimated pooled prevalence of PLP, and risk factors associated with this complication. Methods Articles published between 1980 and July 2019 were identified through a systematic search of the following electronic databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycArticles, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Africa-Wide Information, Health Source: Nursing/Academic Edition, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Academic Search Premier. Grey literature was searched on databases for preprints. Two reviewers independently performed the screening of articles, data extraction and risk of bias assessment. The meta-analyses were conducted using the random-effects model. A statistically significant level for the analyses was set at p>0.05. Results The pooling of all studies demonstrated a prevalence estimate of 63% [95% CI: 58.23-67.05] with high heterogeneity [I2=95.70% (95% CI: 95.10-96.20)]. The prevalence of PLP was significantly lower in developing countries compared to developed countries [53.98% vs 64.55%; p=0.04]. Persistent pre-operative pain, proximal site of amputation, lower limb amputation, stump pain and phantom sensations were identified as risk factors for PLP. Conclusion This systematic review and meta-analysis estimates that six of every 10 people with an amputation report PLP - a high and important prevalence of PLP. Health care professionals ought to be aware of the high rates of PLP and implement strategies to reduce PLP by addressing known risk factors, specifically those identified by the current study.","Limakatso, K.; Bedwell, G.

509,"Dynamic interactions of influenza viruses in Hong Kong during 1998-2018","Influenza epidemics cause substantial morbidity and mortality every year worldwide. Currently, two influenza A subtypes, A(H1N1) and A(H3N2), and type B viruses co-circulate in humans and infection with one type/subtype could provide cross-protection against the others. However, it remains unclear how such ecologic competition via cross-immunity and antigenic mutations that allow immune escape impact influenza epidemic dynamics at the population level. Here we develop a comprehensive model-inference system and apply it to study the evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics of the three influenza types/subtypes in Hong Kong, a city of global public health significance for influenza epidemic and pandemic control. Utilizing long-term influenza surveillance data since 1998, we are able to estimate the strength of cross-immunity between each virus-pairs, the timing and frequency of punctuated changes in population immunity in response to antigenic mutations in influenza viruses, and key epidemiological parameters over the last 20 years including the 2009 pandemic. We find evidence of cross-immunity in all types/subtypes, with strongest cross-immunity from A(H1N1) against A(H3N2). Our results also suggest that A(H3N2) may undergo antigenic mutations in both summers and winters and thus monitoring the virus in both seasons may be important for vaccine development. Overall, our study reveals intricate epidemiological interactions and underscores the importance of simultaneous monitoring of population immunity, incidence rates, and viral genetic and antigenic changes.","Yang, W.; Lau, E.

508,"Association of rs12722 COL5A1 with Pulmonary Tuberculosis infection: a preliminary case-control study in a Kazakhstani population.","Background: Lung cavitation is the classic hallmark of TB, which facilitates the disease development and transmission. It involves the degradation of lung parenchyma which is mainly made up of collagen fibers by metalloproteinases (MMPs) produced by activated monocyte-derived cells, neutrophils and stromal cells. Objective: The following population-based preliminary case-control study of adults with TB and controls without TB will check the possible association between rs1800012 in COL1A1, rs1272222 in COL5A1 genes to human TB susceptibility in Kazakhstan. Methods: In this case-control study including 165 samples we examined the associations between TB disease status and demographic variables along with single nucleotide polymorphisms related to COLA1 and COL5A1. The unadjusted {chi}2 and adjusted logistic regression was performed to find out relationships between SNPS and other predictors. Results: Preliminary findings suggest that there is a statistically significant association of age (OR=0.44, 95% CI:0.21-0.92, p-value=0.03) , social status (OR=0.42, 95% CI:0.201 -0.87, p-value=0.020), HIV status(OR=6.9, 95% CI:1.86 - 25.6, p-value=0.004) and heterozygous rs12722 SNP (OR=2.45, 95% CI:1.16 -5.16 p-value=0.019) polymorphism of COL5A1 gene with TB susceptibility. Conclusion: The association of collagen genes with TB pathogenesis indicates that anti TB programs should develop new drug regimens that include MMP inhibitors.

583,"Cataract in the human lens: a systematic review of proteomic studiesID#008979","Purpose: The aim of this systematic review is to identify all the available data on human lens proteomics with a critical role to age-related cataract formation in order to elucidate the physiopathology of the aging lens. Materials and methods: We searched on Medline and Cochrane databases. The search generated 328 manuscripts. We included nine original proteomic studies that investigated human cataractous lenses. Results: Deamidation was the major age-related post-translational modification. There was a significant increase in the amount of A-crystallin D-isoAsp58 present at all ages, while an increase in the extent of Trp oxidation was apparent in cataract lenses when compared to aged normal lenses. During aging, enzymes with oxidized cysteine at critical sites included GAPDH, glutathione synthase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, and PARK7. Conclusion: D-isoAsp in A crystallin could be associated with the development of age-related cataract in human, by contributing to the denaturation of a crystallin, and decreasing its ability to act as a chaperone. Oxidation of Trp may be associated with nuclear cataract formation in man, while the role of oxidant stress in age-related cataract formation is dominant.","Karakosta, C.; Tzamalis, A.; Aivaliotis, M.; Tsinopoulos, I.",20191022,"Ophthalmology","10.1101/19009035",1,"Christina Karakosta","Aristotle University of Thessaloniki","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19009035v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19009035v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"Not applicable"
667,"An Environment-Wide Study of Adult Cognitive Performance in the 23andMe Cohort","BACKGROUND: With the emergence of web-based data collection methods, large digital health cohorts offer the opportunity to conduct behavioral and epidemiologic research at an unprecedented scale. The size and breadth of such data sets enable discovery of novel associations across the phenotypic spectrum. METHODS: We deployed the digital symbol substitution test (DSST) online to consented 23andMe research participants 50-85 years of age. We tested cross-sectional associations between DSST performance and 824 phenotypes using linear regression models adjusted for age, sex, age*sex interaction, device, time of cohort entry, and ancestry, separately among discovery (n=144,786) and replication (n=93,428) samples; additional analyses further adjusted for education. We post-stratified association estimates on age, sex, and education to adjust for discrepancies across subsamples. Leveraging the rich genetic and phenotypic data available at 23andMe, we also estimated genetic and environmental correlations between DSST and its top correlates using linkage disequilibrium score regression. RESULTS: 97 phenotypes were significantly (false discovery rate < 0.05) and strongly (standardized effect size > |0.5|) associated with DSST performance in the discovery phase. Of those, 60 (38 with additional adjustment for education) demonstrated both statistical significance and consistent direction of association in the replication sample. The significantly associated phenotypes largely clustered into the following categories: psychiatric traits (e.g. anxiety, {beta} per 1 SD = -0.74, P-value=3.9x10-169), education (e.g. highest math class completed, {beta} per 1 SD = 2.11, P-value <1 x 10-300), leisure activities (e.g. solitary activities like puzzles, {beta} per 1 SD = 1.85, P-value <1.0x10-300), social determinants (e.g. household income, {beta} per 1 SD = 1.20, P-value= 8.9x10-245, and lifestyle (e.g. years smoked, {beta} per 1 SD = -0.98, P-value= 2.2x10-78). We identified several reproducible genetic correlations between DSST and its top associated exposures (e.g. 0.48 for leisure activities like puzzles, 0.28 for years of education, and -0.24 for anxiety; all P [&le;] 7.9x10-26). For almost all exposures, genetic correlations with DSST were considerably stronger than environmental correlations. CONCLUSIONS: We have conducted the largest study of cognitive performance to date, building evidence supporting its correlations with many social, lifestyle, and clinical exposures. We established that the observed associations are in part underpinned by shared genetic architecture. Our study illustrates the potential of large-scale digital cohorts to contribute to epidemiologic discovery.","Huang, Y.; Filshtein, T.; 23andme Research Team,  ; Gentleman, R.; Aslibekyan, S.",20191102,"Epidemiology","10.1101/19009076",2,"Stella Aslibekyan","23andMe","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19009076v2?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19009076v2.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"N/A"
636,"Predicting Clinical Dementia Rating Using Blood RNA Levels","INTRODUCTION: The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) is commonly used to assess cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease patients. METHODS: We divided 741 participants with blood microarray data in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) into three groups based on their most recent CDR assessment: cognitive normal (CDR=0), mild dementia (CDR=0.5), and probable AD (CDR[&ge;]1.0). We then used machine learning to predict cognitive status using only blood RNA levels. RESULTS: One chloride intracellular channel 1 (CLIC1) probe was significant. By combining nonsignificant probes with p-values less than 0.1, we averaged 87.87 (s = 1.02)% predictive accuracy in classifying the three groups, compared to a 55.46% baseline for this study. DISCUSSION: We identified one significant probe in CLIC1. However, CLIC1 levels alone were not sufficient to determine dementia status. We propose that combining individually suggestive, but nonsignificant, blood RNA levels can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy.","Miller, J. B.; Kauwe, J.

564,"Diffusion Histology Imaging to Improve Lesion Detection and Classification in Multiple Sclerosis","Background: Diagnosing MS through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) requires extensive clinical experience and tedious work. Furthermore, MRI-indicated MS lesion locations rarely align with the patients' symptoms and often contradict with pathology studies. Our lab has developed and modified a novel diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) technique to address the shortcomings of MRI-based MS diagnoses. Although primary DBSI metrics have been demonstrated to be associated with axonal injury/loss, demyelination and inflammation, a more detailed analysis using multiple DBSI-structural metrics to improve the accuracy of MS lesion detection and differentiation is still needed. Here we report that Diffusion Histology Imaging (DHI), an improved approach that combines a deep neural network (DNN) algorithm with improved DBSI analyses, accurately detected and classified various MS lesion types. Methods: Thirty-eight multiple sclerosis patients were scanned with T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) using fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) using magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE), magnetization transfer contrast (MTR) imaging and diffusion-weighted imaging. The imaging results identified 43,261 voxels from 91 persistent black hole (PBH) lesions, 89 persistent gray hole (PGH) lesions, 16 acute gray hole (AGH) lesions, 189 non-black hole (NBH) lesions and 113 normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) areas. Data extracted from these lesions were randomly split into training, validation, and testing groups with an 8:1:1 ratio. The DNN was constructed with 10 fully-connected hidden layers using TensorFlow 2.0 in Python. Batch normalization and dropout regularization were used for model optimization. Results: Each MS lesion type had unique DBSI derived diffusion metric profiles. Based on these DBSI diffusion metric profiles, DHI achieved a 93.6% overall concordance with neurologist determinations of all five MS lesions, compared with 74.3% from conventional MRI (cMRI)-DNN model, 78.2% from MTR-DNN model, and 80% from DTI-DNN model. DHI also achieved greater performances on detecting individual MS lesion types compared to other models. Specifically, DHI showed great performances on prediction of PBH (AUC: 0.991; F1-score: 0.923), PGH (AUC: 0.977; F1-score: 0.823) and AGH (AUC: 0.987; F1-score: 0.887), which significantly outperformed other models. Conclusions: DHI significantly improves the detection and classification accuracy for various MS lesion types, which could greatly aid the clinical decisions of neurologists and neuroradiologists. The efficacy and efficiency of this DNN model shows great promise for clinical application.","Ye, Z.; George, A.; Wu, A. T.; Niu, X.; Lin, J.; Adusumilli, G.; Cross, A.

561,"Dissecting the association of C-reactive protein levels with PTSD, traumatic events, and social support","Inflammatory markers like C-reactive protein (CRP) have been associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic experience, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We investigated the association among CRP, PTSD, and traits related to traumatic events and social support using genome-wide data from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (30,000 cases and 170,000 controls), the UK Biobank (UKB; up to 117,900 individuals), and the CHARGE study (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology, 148,164 individual). Linkage disequilibrium score regression, polygenic risk scoring, and two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses were used to investigate genetic overlap and causal relationships. Genetic correlations of CRP were observed with PTSD (rg=0.16, p=0.026) and behavioral and emotional response to trauma, exposure to traumatic events, and the presence of social support (-0.28<rg<0.20; p<0.008). We observed a bidirectional association between CRP and PTSD (CRP->PTSD: beta=0.065, p=0.015; PTSD->CRP: beta=0.008, p=0.009). CRP also showed a negative association on the 'felt loved as a child' trait (UKB, beta;=-0.017, p=0.008). Due to the known association of socioeconomic status (SES) on PTSD and social support, a multivariable MR was performed to investigate SES as potential mediator. We found that household income (univariate MR: beta=-0.22, p=1.57x10-7; multivariate MR: beta=-0.17, p=0.005) and deprivation index (univariate MR: beta=0.38, p=1.63x10-9; multivariate MR: beta=0.27, p=0.016) were driving the causal estimates of 'felt loved as a child' and CRP on PTSD. The present findings highlight a bidirectional association between PTSD and CRP levels, also suggesting a potential role of SES in the interplay between childhood support and inflammatory processes with respect to PTSD risk.","Muniz Carvalho, C.; Wendt, F.; Maihofer, A.; Stein, D.; Stein, M.; Sumner, J.; Hemmings, S.; Nievergelt, C.; Koenen, K.; Gelernter, J.; Belangero, S.; Polimanti, R.",20191022,"Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology","10.1101/19009134",1,"Renato Polimanti","Yale University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19009134v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19009134v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"All data generated during this study are included in this published article and its Supplemental information files."
528,"Bringing Proportional Recovery into Proportion: Bayesian Hierarchical Modelling of Post-Stroke Motor Performance","Accurate predictions of motor performance after stroke are of cardinal importance for the patient, clinician, and health care system. More than ten years ago, the proportional recovery rule was introduced by promising just that: high-fidelity predictions of recovery following stroke based only on the initially lost motor performance, at least for a specific fraction of patients. However, emerging evidence suggests that this recovery rule is subject to various confounds and may apply less universally than assumed by many. We systematically revisited stroke outcome predictions by casting the data in a less confounded form and employing more integrative and flexible hierarchical Bayesian models. We jointly analyzed n=385 post-stroke trajectories from six separate studies - the currently largest overall dataset of upper limb motor recovery. We addressed confounding ceiling effects by introducing a subset approach and ensured correct model estimation through synthetic data simulations. Finally, we used model comparisons to assess the underlying nature of recovery within our empirical recovery data. The first model comparison, relying on the conventional fraction of patients called fitters, pointed to a combination of constant and proportional to lost function recovery. Proportional to lost here describes the original notion of proportionality, indicating greater recovery in case of a more pronounced initial deficit. This combination explained only 32% of the variance in recovery, which is in stark contrast to previous reports of >80%. When instead analyzing the complete spectrum of subjects, model comparison selected a composite of constant and proportional to spared function recovery, implying a more significant improvement in case of more preserved function. Explained variance was at 53%. Therefore, our data suggest that motor recovery post-stroke may exhibit some characteristics of proportionality. However, the levels of explanatory value were substantially reduced compared to what has previously been reported. This finding motivates future research moving beyond solely behavior scores to explain stroke recovery and establish robust single-subject predictions.","Bonkhoff, A.

569,"Bringing Critical Race Praxis into the Study of Electrophysiological Substrate of Sudden Cardiac Death: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study","Race is an established risk factor for sudden cardiac death (SCD). We sought to determine whether the association of electrophysiological (EP) substrate with SCD varies between black and white individuals. Participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study with analyzable ECGs (n=14,408; age 54{+/-}6 y; 74% white) were included. EP substrate was characterized by traditional 12-lead ECG and vectorcardiographic metrics. Two competing outcomes were adjudicated SCD and non-sudden cardiac death (nonSCD). Interaction of ECG metrics with race was studied in Cox proportional hazards and Fine-Gray competing risk models, adjusted for prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD), risk factors, and incident non-fatal CVD.

535,"Eligibility for Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator in Congenital Heart Disease","Background: The goals of this study were: assess left-and right-sided subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (SICD) eligibility in adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) patients, use machine learning to predict SICD eligibility in ACHD patients, and transform 12-lead ECG to S-ICD 3-lead ECG, and vice versa. Methods: ACHD outpatients (n=101; age 42{+/-}14 y; 52% female; 85% white; left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 56{+/-}9%) were enrolled in a prospective study. Supine and standing 12-lead ECG was recorded simultaneously with a right- and left-sided S-ICD 3-lead ECG. Peak-to-peak QRS and T amplitudes, RR, PR, QT, QTc, QRS intervals, Tmax, and R/Tmax (31 predictor variables) were tested. Model selection, training, and testing were performed using supine ECG datasets. Validation was performed using standing ECG datasets and out-of-sample non-ACHD population (n=68; age 54{+/-}16 y; 54% female; 94% white; LVEF 61{+/-}8%). Results: A 40% of participants were ineligible for S-ICD. Tetralogy of Fallot patients passed right-sided screening (57%) more often than left-sided (21%; McNemar's {chi}2 P=0.025). The ridge model demonstrated the best cross-validation function. Validation of the ridge models was satisfactory for standing left-sided [ROC AUC 0.687 (95%CI 0.582-0.791)] and right-sided [ROC AUC 0.655(95%CI 0.549-0.762)] SICD eligibility prediction. Out-of-sample validation in the non-ACHD population yielded a 100% sensitivity of the pre-selected threshold for the elastic net model. Validation of the transformation matrices showed satisfactory agreement (<0.1 mV difference). Conclusion: Nearly half of the contemporary ACHD population is ineligible for S-ICD. Machine-learning prediction of SICD eligibility can be used for screening of SICD candidates.

553,"Improving parents knowledge of early signs of pediatric eye disease: A double-blind RCT","Background and Objectives: Early diagnosis and intervention is essential to achieve optimal outcomes for most pediatric eye diseases. Educating parents/caregivers to recognize early signs of disease and consult a healthcare professional is critical to achieving this aim. We evaluate the effectiveness of an eye-health information pamphlet on parents level of concern and their help-seeking intention if they observed leukocoria or strabismus. Methods: Pregnant women attending a metropolitan antenatal clinic were recruited to the study. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a pamphlet on either pediatric eye health (intervention) or strategies for play (control). The primary outcome measure was a change in the parents level of concern if they observed leukocoria or strabismus. The secondary outcome measure was a change in their help-seeking intention if either sign was observed. Results: Of the 518 women enrolled, 382 (73.7%) completed the post-test survey. At follow-up, women who received the intervention were more likely to report a higher level of concern if they observed leukocoria (OR 1.711 [CI: 1.176-2.497] p=0.005]) and were less likely to have a delayed help-seeking intention. (OR 0.560 [CI 0.382-0.817] p =0.003) No change in the level of concern for strabismus was identified between the groups; however, at follow-up, women who received the intervention were less likely to delay help-seeking (OR 0.318 [CI 0.125-0.806] p=0.016). Conclusion: Providing parents with relevant, evidence-based information can significantly improve their knowledge and positively influence help-seeking intentions if leukocoria or strabismus are observed.

598,"Increasing Firearm Deaths in The Youngest Americans: Ecologic Correlation with Firearm Prevalence","Background: In the United States (U.S.), the overall death rate in 1-4 year-olds had been steadily declining until 2011, after which it ceased to improve. To understand this trend reversal, we investigated trends in the causes of their deaths. Methods: Mortality data were obtained from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, firearm background check data from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, and civilian firearm prevalence from the Small Arms Survey. Findings: In 1-4 year-olds, the rate of fatal firearm accidents during 2002-2017 increased exponentially at an average rate of 6.0%/year (p=0.0003). The rate of increase was the greatest of all evaluable causes of death in the age group. Both the rate increase and most recent absolute rate in firearm accidental deaths in young children were correlated with the concurrent corresponding rate of firearm background checks (p = 0.0002 and 0.003, respectively). Also, the firearm accidental death rate in countries with high civilian firearm prevalence was correlated with the number of guns per civilian population (p=0.002). Interpretation: Prior to 2004, the childhood firearm death rate did not increase during the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. Since 2004 when the Ban ended, the steadily increasing rate of sales and concomitant availability of, and access to, firearms in the U.S. has been associated with an increase in fatal firearm accidents in its youngest children. The acceleration of firearm deaths and injuries among young Americans requires urgent, definitive solutions that address firearm prevalence. Funding: No external funding.","Bleyer, A.; Siegel, S.

549,"Female genital schistosomiasis and reproductive tract infections. A cross-sectional study in rural adolescents in South Africa","Background and objectives: The aim of the current study was to establish the relative prevalences of Female Genital Schistosomiasis (FGS) and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). We hypothesised that due to the use of syndromic management for STIs it is possible that FGS is being misdiagnosed and mismanaged as an STI. We therefore wanted to examine the relationship between FGS and the individual STIs in schistosomiasis endemic areas. Methods: Between 2011 and 2013, a cross-sectional study was performed in 32 randomly selected secondary schools in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, where each school had at least 300 pupils. In a research clinic, FGS diagnosis, STI testing, and face-to-face interviews were performed in sexually active, young women aged 16 - 22 years. Results: FGS was the second most prevalent current genital infection (23%). There were significantly more women who had presented FGS among those who had detectable urinary schistosomiasis (35%), compared to those without (19%, p< 0.001). In the FGS positive group 35% were positive for HPV infection, compared to 24 % in the FGS negative group (p=0.010). In the FGS positive group 37% were sero-positive for HSV infection, compared to 30% in the FGS negative group (p=0.079). There were significantly fewer chlamydia infections amongst women with FGS (20%, p=0.018) compared with those who did not have FGS (28%). Conclusions: FGS was the second most common genital infection after HSV but the two were not significantly associated. HPV infection was significantly associated with FGS. Surprisingly Chlamydia infection were negatively associated with FGS. The results show the importance of the inclusion of FGS in the management protocols for genital infections in areas endemic for urinary schistosomiasis, and highlight the importance for more research on suitable differential diagnostic tools and disease management.","Shukla, J.

572,"Evaluation of a brief intervention to reduce cell phone use in college students","Background. Excessive cell phone use contributes to distracted driving, may increase the risk for automobile accidents, and a minority of mobile phone users exhibit behaviors consistent with technological addiction. The purpose of this study was to determine whether cell phone beliefs and behaviors could be changed by a brief educational encounter. The Theory of Reasoned Action provided a lens for viewing attitudes and behavior. Methods. A one-week pre-post design with a thirty-day follow-up was used with participants (N = 215, 67.0% female, age = 20.0 + 1.6) assigned to a peer-led intervention or comparison groups. The intervention included cell-phone educational materials. A short index of cell phone behavior was developed which showed good internal consistency with a Cronbachs alpha of .81. Results. The intervention group agreed or strongly-agreed more than the comparison group on five of the seven areas of cell phone beliefs and behaviors ( p < 0.05, item Cohens d = .32 to .47, total d = .50) at one-week following receipt of informational materials. Discussion. We conclude that attitudes and behaviors regarding cell phones are malleable and susceptible to change in young-adults following a brief psychoeducational intervention.","Piper, B.

679,"A spatio-temporal approach to short-term forecasting of visceral leishmaniasis diagnoses in India","Background: The elimination programme for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in India has seen great progress, with total cases decreasing by over 80% since 2010 and many blocks now reporting zero cases from year to year. Prompt diagnosis and treatment is critical to continue progress and avoid epidemics in the increasingly susceptible population. Short-term forecasts could be used to highlight anomalies in incidence and support health service logistics. The model which best fits the data is not necessarily most useful for prediction, yet little empirical work has been done to investigate the balance between fit and predictive performance. Principal Findings: We developed statistical models of monthly VL case counts at block level. By evaluating a set of randomly-generated models, we found that fit and one-month-ahead prediction were strongly correlated and that rolling updates to model parameters as data accrued were not crucial for accurate prediction. The final model incorporated auto-regression over four months, spatial correlation between neighbouring blocks,and seasonality. Ninety-four percent of 10-90% prediction intervals from this model captured the observed count during a 24-month test period. Comparison of one-, three- and four-month-ahead predictions from the final model fit demonstrated that a longer time horizon yielded only a small sacrifice in predictive power for the vast majority of blocks. Conclusions: The model developed is informed by routinely-collected surveillance data as it accumulates, and predictions are sufficiently accurate and precise to be useful. Such forecasts could, for example, be used to guide stock requirements for rapid diagnostic tests and drugs. More comprehensive data on factors thought to influence geographic variation in VL burden could be incorporated, and might better explain the heterogeneity between blocks and improve uniformity of predictive performance.Integration of the approach in the management of the VL programme would be an important step to ensuring continued successful control. and processing of the data,predictive power more than three months ahead of current data is crucial to make forecasts which can feasibly be acted upon. Some heterogeneity remains in predictive power across the study region which could potentially be improved using unit-specific data on factors believed to be associated with reported VL incidence (e.g. age distribution, socio-economic status and climate)","Nightingale, E.

518,"BRAF mutation testing of MSI CRCs in Lynch syndrome diagnostics: performance and efficiency according to patient`s age","Background and aims: BRAF V600E mutations have been reported to be associated with sporadic microsatellite-unstable (MSI) colorectal cancer (CRC), while rarely detected in CRCs of Lynch syndrome (LS) patients. Therefore, current international diagnostic guidelines recommend somatic BRAF mutation testing in MLH1-deficient MSI CRC patients to exclude LS. As sporadic BRAF-mutant MSI CRC is a disease of the elderly, while LS-associated CRC usually occurs at younger age, we hypothesized that the efficacy of BRAF testing in LS diagnostics may be age-dependent. Methods: We systematically compared the prevalence of BRAF V600E mutations in LS-associated CRCs and MSI CRCs from population-based cohorts in different age groups as available from published studies, databases, and population-based patient cohorts. Cost calculations and sensitivity analysis of the BRAF testing for exclusion of LS was performed. Results: Among 969 MSI CRCs from LS mutation carriers from the literature and German HNPCC Consortium, 15 (1.6%, 95% CI: 0.9-2.6%) harbored BRAF mutations. 6/7 LS patients with BRAF-mutant CRC and reported age were <50 years. Among unselected MSI CRCs, 44.8% (339/756) harbored BRAF mutations, 92.3% (313/339) of which were detected in patients >60 years. In MSI CRC patients <50, BRAF mutations were detected only in 0.6% (2/339), and the inclusion of BRAF testing led to increased costs and higher risk of missing LS patients (1.2%) compared to other age groups. Conclusion: BRAF testing in patients <50 years is cost-inefficient and carries the highest risk of missing LS patients among different age groups. We suggest direct referral of MSI CRC patients <50 years to genetic counseling without prior BRAF testing.","Blaker, H.; Haupt, S.; Morak, M.; Holinski-Feder, E.; Arnold, A.; Horst, D.; Sieber-Frank, J.; Seidler, F.; Von Winterfeld, M.; Alwers, E.; Chang-Claude, J.; Brenner, H.; Roth, W.; Engel, C.; Loffler, M.; Moslein, G.; Schackert, H.-K.; Weitz, J.; Perne, C.; Aretz, S.; Huneburg, R.; Schmiegel, W.; Vangala, D.; Rahner, N.; Steinke-Lange, V.; Heuveline, V.; Von Knebel Doeberitz, M.; Ahadova, A.; Hoffmeister, M.; Kloor, M.; The German Consortium For Familial Intestinal Cancer,  ",20191016,"Gastroenterology","10.1101/19009274",1,"Hendrik Blker","Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19009274v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19009274v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"All relevant data are included in the supplementary material."
534,"Phase I assessments of first-in-human administration of a novel malaria anti-sporozoite vaccine candidate, R21 in matrix-M adjuvant, in UK and Burkinabe volunteers","Background Improvements in malaria control have stalled recently and new tools are needed. The R21 vaccine is comprised of the malaria circumsporozoite protein fused to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). It forms particles that lack the excess HBsAg in the frequently tested malaria vaccine candidate, RTS,S/AS01B. Methods We conducted an open-label, first-in-human, Phase Ia study evaluating safety and immunogenicity of R21 administered alone and with the saponin-based adjuvant, Matrix-MTM (MM). Twenty-eight healthy adults received three doses of R21 given intramuscularly 4 weeks apart. We subsequently conducted a Phase Ib randomised, controlled trial in West African adults. Findings Vaccinations were well tolerated, and the majority of local and systemic adverse events were mild. Reactogenicity was significantly lower in Burkinabe than UK vaccinees (p<0.0001). Antibody responses increased significantly 28 days after the 2nd vaccination in UK volunteers. Antibody responses to R21 in all dose groups (2g, 10g and 50g) were comparable to those of 50g RTS,S/AS01B in malaria-naive adults at 28 days after final vaccination. The 10g dose induced more durable responses, with 2-fold higher NANP-specific IgG titres at 6 months compared with the 2g and 50g dose groups. R21 also boosted baseline humoral responses in Burkinabe adults with well-maintained responses suggesting natural boosting. Interpretation R21 adjuvanted with MM is safe and has comparable immunogenicity to RTS,S/AS01B, even when administered at a five-fold lower 10g dose in UK and African populations. This forms the basis for efficacy testing of this vaccine which could prove to be particularly cost-effective to manufacture and deploy.","Venkatraman, N.; Tiono, A.; Bowyer, G.; Powlson, J.; Collins, K.; Coulibaly, S.; Datoo, M.; Silman, D.; Ouedraogo, A.; Nebie, I.; Imoukhuede, E.; Brod, F.; Folegatti, P.; Dickinson, E.; Jamieson, S.; Bougouma, E.; Wright, D.; Bellamy, D.; Diarra, A.; Bliss, C.; Morter, R.; Glenn, G.; Fries, L.; Reimer, J.; Lovgren-Bengtsson, K.; Baker, M.; Poulton, I.; Moyle, S.; Berrie, E.; Green, N.; Mukhopadhyay, E.; Viebig, N.; Angus, B.; Lawrie, A.; Roberts, R.; Gilbert, S.; Lewis, D.; Sirima, S.; Ewer, K.; Hill, A.",20191018,"Infectious Diseases","10.1101/19009282",1,"Katie Ewer","University of Oxford","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19009282v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19009282v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc",NA,"All data related to this study is contained in the manuscript."
582,"Improved Alzheimer's disease versus frontotemporal lobar degeneration differential diagnosis combining EEG and neurochemical biomarkers","Introduction: Distinguishing between two of the most common causes of dementia, Alzheimer disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), on clinical diagnostic criteria alone has poor diagnostic accuracy. Promising tools to increase the diagnostic accuracy of AD are the use of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and electroencephalography (EEG), which is being investigated as a diagnostic tool for neurodegenerative brain disorders. In this study, we investigated the utility of EEG-based biomarkers in comparison and in addition to established neurochemical biomarkers in the AD versus FTLD differential diagnosis. Methods: Our study cohort comprised 37 AD and 32 FTLD patients, of which 19 AD and 11 FTLD had definite diagnoses. All these participants had CSF biomarker analyses resulting in four neurochemical (NCM) biomarkers (A{beta}1-42, T-tau, P-tau181 and Nf-L) and underwent 19-channel resting-state EEG. From the EEG spectra, dominant frequency peaks (DFP) were extracted in four regions resulting in four dominant frequencies (in left-temporal, frontal, right-temporal and parieto-occipital regions). This yielded a total of eight features (4 NCM + 4 EEG), which we used to train and test a classifier and assess the diagnostic value of the markers separately (using only the NCM or EEG subset) and combined. Results: The classification accuracies were much higher when training and testing on the definite subgroup than on the whole group. Furthermore, we found that the NCM feature subset allowed a better accuracy than the EEG feature subset, both when training and testing on the whole group (NCM 82% vs EEG 72%), as on the definite group only (92% vs 86%). Using both feature subsets together increased the accuracy to 86% in the whole group and 94% in the definite subgroups. Another interesting finding was the presence of two spectral peaks in a considerable number of patients in both groups. Conclusion: Combining EEG with neurochemical biomarkers resulted in differential diagnostic accuracies of 86% in clinically diagnosed AD and FTD patients and of 94% in patients having a definite diagnosis. Furthermore, we found evidence that the slowing down of the dominant EEG rhythm might be a gradual appearance of a slow rhythm and fading out of the normal ground rhythm, rather than a gradual slowing down of the ground rhythm. Finally, we have discovered two differences in the occurrence of the dominant EEG frequency: people lacking a clear dominant peak almost all had definite AD, while people with two peaks more often had FTLD. These unexpected but interesting findings need to be explored further.","Laton, J. S.; Van Schependom, J.; Goossens, J.; Wiels, W.; Sieben, A.; De Deyn, P.

METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, electronic medical records for all patients undergoing intravitreal injections (IVI) in a tertiary referral centre between March 2013 and October 2018 were analysed. Treatment response in terms of visual acuity outcomes were reported for all eyes over a 4-year observation period. RESULTS: Our cohort includes 2616 DMO eyes of 1965 patients over 48 months.

648,"Does Smoking Cause Lower Educational Attainment and General Cognitive Ability? Triangulation of causal evidence using multiple study designs","Objectives: Observational epidemiological studies have found associations between smoking and both poorer cognitive ability and lower educational attainment; however, evaluating causality is more challenging. We used two complementary methods to attempt to ascertain whether smoking causes poorer cognitive ability and lower educational attainment. Design: A cohort study (Study One) and a two-sample Mendelian randomization study using publicly-available summary statistics (Study Two). Setting: The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a birth-cohort study based in Bristol, United Kingdom, and general population samples from published genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Participants: Up to 12,004 young people in ALSPAC (complete case analysis N = 2,107) (Study One and Study Two), and summary statistics from three previously published GWAS (not individual-level data) (Study Two). Main outcome measures: Cognitive ability at age 15 (assessed via the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence) and educational attainment at age 16 (assessed via school records) (Study One), and educational attainment (measured as years in education) and fluid intelligence from previously published GWAS (Study Two). Results: In Study One, heaviness of smoking at age 15 was associated with lower cognitive ability at age 15 and lower educational attainment at age 16. Adjustment for potential confounders and earlier cognitive ability or educational attainment attenuated findings although evidence of an association remained (e.g., fully adjusted cognitive ability beta -0.736, 95% CI -1.238 to -0.233, P = 0.004; fully adjusted educational attainment beta -1.254, 95% CI -1.597 to -0.911, P < 0.001). Comparable results were found in sensitivity analyses of multiply imputed data. In Study Two, two-sample Mendelian randomization indicated that both smoking initiation and lifetime smoking lower educational attainment and cognitive ability (e.g., smoking initiation to educational attainment inverse-variance weighted MR beta -0.197, 95% CI -0.223, -0.171, P = 1.78 x 10-49). Educational attainment results were robust to various sensitivity analyses, while cognition analyses were less so. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence consistent with a causal effect of smoking on lower educational attainment, although were less consistent for cognitive ability. The triangulation of evidence from observational and Mendelian randomisation methods is an important strength for causal inference.","Gage, S. H.; Sallis, H. H.; Lassi, G.; Wootton, R.

631,"PARP1/2 imaging with 18F-PARPi in patients with head and neck cancer","Purpose. We performed a first-in-human clinical trial. The aim of this study was to determine safety and feasibility of PET imaging with 18F-PARPi in patients with head and neck cancer. Patients and Methods. Eleven patients (age 49 to 86 years) with newly diagnosed or recurrent oral and oropharyngeal cancer were injected intravenously with 18F-PARPi (331 {+/-} 42 MBq) and dynamic PET/CT imaging was performed between 0 min and 25 min post-injection. Static PET/CT scans were obtained at 30 min, 60 min and 120 min p.i. Blood samples for tracer concentration and metabolite analysis were collected. Blood pressure, ECG, oxygen levels, clinical chemistry and CBC were obtained before and after administration of 18F-PARPi. Results. 18F-PARPi was well-tolerated by all patients without any safety concerns. Of the 11 patients included in the analysis, 18F-PARPi had focal uptake in all primary lesions (n = 10, SUVmax = 2.8 {+/-} 1.2) and all 18F-FDG positive lymph nodes (n = 34). 18F-PARPi uptake was seen in 18F-FDG negative lymph nodes of three patients (n = 6). Focal uptake of tracer in primary and metastatic lesions was corroborated by CT alone or in combination with 18F-FDG. Contrast for 18F-PARPi and 18F-FDG was comparable (SUVmax(lesion)/SUVmax(genioglossus) = 3.3 and 3.0, respectively; p = 0.23), and SUVmax values for 18F-PARPi were less variable compared to 18F-FDG (1.3 versus 6.0, p = 0.001). Conclusions. Imaging of head and neck cancer with 18F-PARPi is feasible and safe. 18F-PARPi detects primary and metastatic lesions, and retention in tumors is longer than in healthy tissues.","Schoder, H.; Demetrio De Souza Franca, P.; Nakajima, R.; Burnazi, E.; Roberts, S.; Brand, C.; Grkovski, M.; Mauguen, A.; Dunphy, M.

863,"Violin plot data: A concerto of crucial information on valve thrombogenicity categorized in vitro by valve motion and inferred flow velocity","Objectives: We hypothesize that prosthetic valve thrombogenic potential may be inferred by valve regional flow velocity. This metric was used to compare two clinical valves and two experimental prototypes. Methods: Four our clinical and experimental prototype valve models were tested in aortic and mitral sites under pulsatile circulation in a pulse duplicator. An optical approach measuring projected dynamic valve area to gauge valve motion was implemented. Pulsatile pressures and flow rates were measured by conventional techniques and a quasi-steady flow tester was used to measure valve leakage. Regurgitant flow velocity was derived using time-dependent volumetric flow rate / projected dynamic valve area. Since flow velocity and fluid shear force are related through flow velocity gradient, thrombogenic potential for valves that achieve near closure during the forward flow deceleration phase were determined as regurgitant flow velocities relative to the control mechanical valve regurgitant flow velocity of -126 m/s. Analysis of the flow velocity data made use of Vioplot R* and VISIO software packages to provide split violin plots that represent probability of recurrence of data. Results: Thrombogenic potential was made dimensionless and ranged between -0.45 and +1.0. Negative thrombogenic potentials arise when transient rebound of valve occluder is accompanied by water-hammer phenomena. Positive thrombogenic potentials occur during decelerating forward flow. Bioprostheses had lowest thrombogenic potential transient of 0.15. A mock-transcatheter aortic valve replacement incorporating by design a trivial paravalvular leak (~1.35 ml/s) demonstrated a high transient thrombogenic potential of 0.95. Conclusions: Our data reveals distinct thrombogenic potential profile differences between valve models. If our study methods are verifiable, the design of future valves may utilize currently available experimental tools to produce advanced devices with significantly reduced thrombogenic potential.","Scotten, L.

574,"Point-of-care serodiagnostic test for early-stage Lyme disease using a multiplexed paper-based immunoassay and machine learning","Caused by the tick-borne spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, Lyme disease (LD) is the most common vector-borne infectious disease in North America and Europe. Though timely diagnosis and treatment are effective in preventing disease progression, current tests are insensitive in early-stage LD, with a sensitivity <50%. Additionally, the serological testing currently recommended by the US Center for Disease Control has high costs (>$400/test) and extended sample-to-answer timelines (>24 hours). To address these challenges, we created a cost-effective and rapid point-of-care (POC) test for early-stage LD that assays for antibodies specific to seven Borrelia antigens and a synthetic peptide in a paper-based multiplexed vertical flow assay (xVFA). We trained a deep learning-based diagnostic algorithm to select an optimal subset of antigen/peptide targets, and then blindly-tested our xVFA using human samples (N(+) = 42, N(-)= 54), achieving an area-under-the-curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of 0.950, 90.5%, and 87.0% respectively, outperforming previous LD POC tests. With batch-specific standardization and threshold tuning, the specificity of our blind-testing performance improved to 96.3%, with an AUC and sensitivity of 0.963 and 85.7%, respectively.","Joung, H.-A.; Ballard, Z.

517,"Association of polygenic risk scores for coronary artery disease with subsequent events amongst established cases","Background: There is growing evidence that polygenic risk scores (PRS) can be used to identify individuals at high lifetime risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Whether they can also be used to stratify risk of subsequent events among those surviving a first CAD event remains uncertain. Methods: Using two subsamples of UK Biobank, defined at baseline as prevalent CAD (N=10,287) and without CAD (N=393,108), we evaluated associations between a CAD PRS and incident cardiovascular and fatal outcomes, during a median follow up of 7.8 years. Results: A 1 S.D. higher PRS was associated with increased risk of incident MI in participants without CAD (OR 1.33; 95% C.I. 1.29, 1.38), but the effect estimate was markedly attenuated in those with prevalent CAD (OR 1.15; 95% C.I. 1.06, 1.25); heterogeneity P =0.0012. Additionally, among prevalent CAD cases, we found evidence of an inverse association between the CAD PRS and risk of all-cause death (OR 0.91; 95% C.I. 0.85, 0.98) compared to those without CAD (OR 1.01; 95% C.I. 0.99, 1.03); heterogeneity P =0.0041. A similar inverse association was found for ischaemic stroke (Prevalent CAD (OR 0.78; 95% C.I. 0.67, 0.90); without CAD (OR 1.09; 95% C.I. 1.04, 1.15), heterogeneity P < 0.001). Conclusions: Bias induced by case stratification and survival into UK Biobank may attenuate, or reverse, associations of polygenic risk scores derived from case-control studies or populations initially free of disease. Polygenic risk scores for subsequent events should be derived from new genome wide association studies conducted in patients with established disease.","Howe, L. J.; Dudbridge, F.; Schmidt, A.

DESIGN: Systematic review DATA SOURCES: Sources included on PubMed, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, WANFANG database and the Chinese Scientific Journals Full-Text Database (CQVIP) from 1997 to 2019. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: (1) the Chinese and English literatures of study on varicella-zoster virus immunization epidemics in different regions of China; (2) The literature has obvious age stratification; (3) The subjects are general people; (4) VZV sero-prevalence in the population investigated by the literature research institute. Exclusion criteria: Any study that did not contain these information was excluded. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two evaluators independently retrieved documents and extracted data. Information about the study design, eligible population, age and gender distribution, inclusion and exclusion criteria were checked. When they disagreed, they could solve the problem by discussion or by soliciting opinions from third parties. RESULTS: Literatures were screened according to the inclusion criteria and 10 studies from 1997 to 2019 with a total of 11666 individuals were included. The overall VZV seroprevalence in the Chinese population was 65.80% (95% CI; 56.5% - 75.1%), and the peak prevalence was seen in the age 36-45 93.50% (95% CI; 0.917-0.953) while the VZV seroprevalence rate (82.20%, 95% CI: 0.544-1.099) was not increased in individuals of 45 and older. CONCLUSION: The incidence of VZV increases with age, and there was no significant difference between different genders or regions.

Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, China Biomedical Literature database (CBM), WanFang Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP) (from their inception to April 2019) were searched to capture relevant articles. Relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for CINV and AEs were all extracted or calculated. Result: Eleven studies with 1107 cancer patients were involved in this review. The pooled RR of delayed CINV (RR=0.50, 95%CI: 0.38 0.66, P<0.01) were significant decreased in olanzapine group. Besides, the occurrence of insomnia was statistically decreased. The rate of acute CINV (RR=0.60, 95%CI: 0.48 0.75, P<0.01) was also significant decreased. However only the percent of CINV III and CINV IV were significant deceased in acute and delayed phase. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the efficacy was no statistically significant difference between 5mg and 10mg for olanzapine. Conclusion: Olanzapine significant decreased the occurrence of CINV III and CINV IV and insomnia in high and moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Compared with 10mg per day, 5mg oral may be more appropriate for patients with cancer.","Zhou, J.; Huang, L.; Jin, S.-H.; Xc, C.; Ma, H.",20191118,"Oncology","10.1101/19009456",2,"Jianguo Zhou Sr.","Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19009456v2?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19009456v2.full.pdf","cc_no","10.1093/annonc/mdz261.007","All data of our review were extracted from the articles which published on journal."
600,"Immune response and endocytosis pathways are associated with the escape of Alzheimer's Disease","The risk to develop and escape Alzheimer's disease (AD) is influenced by a constellation of genetic variants, each associated with specific molecular pathways. Different pathways may differentially contribute to the modification of the AD-risk. We studied the molecular mechanisms that explain the extreme ends of the cognitive spectrum by comparing pathway-specific polygenic risk scores (pathway-PRS) in individuals with AD and those who escaped AD until old age. We used 29 genetic variants associated with AD to calculate pathway-PRS for five major pathways involved in AD. We developed an integrative framework that allows multiple genes to associate with a variant, and multiple pathways to associate with a gene. We studied pathway-PRS in patients with AD (N=1,909), population controls (N=1,654), and cognitively healthy centenarians who escaped AD (N=293). Last, we estimated the contribution of each pathway to the genetic risk of AD in the general population. All pathway-PRS significantly associated with increased AD-risk and escaping AD (p<0.05). The pathway that contributed the most to the overall modulation of AD-risk was {beta}-amyloid metabolism (32%), driven mainly by APOE variants. After excluding APOE variants, all pathway-PRS associated with increased AD-risk (p<0.05), while specifically immune response (p=3.1x10-3) and endocytosis (p=3.8x10-4) associated with escaping AD. These pathways were the main contributors to the overall modulation of genetic risk of AD (41.3% and 21.4%, respectively). Our work suggests that immune response and endocytosis might be involved in general neuro-protective functions, and highlights the need to study these pathways, next to {beta}-amyloid metabolism.","Tesi, N.; Van Der Lee, S.; Hulsman, M.; Jansen, I.; Stringa, N.; Van Schoor, N.; Scheltens, P.; Van Der Flier, W.; Huisman, M.; Reinders, M.; Holstege, H.",20191025,"Genetic And Genomic Medicine","10.1101/19009464",2,"Henne Holstege","Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19009464v2?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19009464v2.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"We provide in the supplements the estimates to construct pathway-specific polygenic risk scores with any genotype data.

580,"Randomized controlled trial combining constraint-induced movement therapy and action-observation training in unilateral cerebral palsy: clinical effects and influencing factors of treatment response.","Introduction. Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) improves upper limb (UL) motor execution in unilateral cerebral palsy (uCP). As these children also show motor planning deficits, action-observation training (AOT) might be of additional value. Here, we investigated the combined effect of AOT to CIMT and identified factors influencing treatment response. Methods. Forty-four children with uCP (mean 9y6m, SD 1y10m) participated in a 9-day camp wearing a splint for 6 hours/day and were allocated to the CIMT+AOT (n=22) and the CIMT+placebo group (n=22). The CIMT+AOT group received 15 hours of AOT (i.e. video-observation) and executed the observed tasks, whilst the CIMT+AOT group watched videos free of biological motion and executed the same tasks. The primary outcome measure was bimanual performance. Secondary outcomes included measures at body function and activity level assessed before (T1), after (T2) the intervention, and at 6 months follow-up (T3). Influencing factors included behavioural and neurological characteristics. Results. Although no between-groups differences were found (p>0.05), the addition of AOT led to higher gains in children with initially poorer bimanual performance (p=0.02). Both groups improved in all outcome measures after the intervention and retained the gains at follow up (p<0.01). Poor sensory function resulted in larger improvements in the total group (p=0.03) and high amount of mirror movements tended to result in better response to the additional AOT training (p=0.06). Improvements were similar irrespective of the type of brain lesion or corticospinal tract wiring pattern. Conclusions. Adding AOT to CIMT, resulted in better outcome for children with poor motor function and high amount of mirror movements. CIMT with or without AOT seems to be more beneficial for children with poor sensory function.

906,"PheWAS-ME: A web-app for interactive exploration of multimorbidity patterns in PheWAS","Summary: Electronic health records (EHRs) linked with a DNA biobank provide unprecedented opportunities to use big data for biomedical research in precision medicine. The Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) is a widely used technique for high-throughput evaluation of relationships between a set of genetic variants and a large collection of clinical phenotypes recorded in EHRs. PheWAS analyses are typically presented as static tables and charts of summary statistics obtained from statistical tests of association between pairs of a genetic variant and individual phenotypes. Comorbidities are common and typically lead to complex, multivariate gene-disease association signals that are challenging to interpret. Discovering and interrogating multimorbidity patterns and their influence in PheWAS is difficult and time- consuming. Here, we present a web application to visualize individual-level genotype and phenotype data side-by-side with PheWAS analysis results in an interactive dashboard, allowing researchers to explore multimorbidity patterns and their associations with a genetic variant of interest. We expect this application to enrich PheWAS analyses by illuminating clinical multimorbidity patterns present in the data.","Strayer, N.; Shirey-Rice, J. K.; Shyr, Y.; Denny, J. C.; Pulley, J.

533,"A Network Analysis Framework to Improve the Delivery of Mosquito Abatement Services in Machala, Ecuador","Background: Vector-borne disease places a high health and economic burden in the American tropics. Comprehensive vector control programs remain the primary method of containing local outbreaks. With limited resources, many vector control operations struggle to serve all affected communities within their districts. In the coastal city of Machala, Ecuador, vector control services, such as application of larvicides and truck-mounted fogging, are delivered through two deployment facilities managed by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Health. Public health professionals in Machala face several logistical issues when delivering mosquito abatement services, namely applying limited resources in ways that will most effectively suppress vectors of malaria, dengue, and encephalitis viruses. Methods: Using a transportation network analysis framework, we built models of service areas and optimized delivery routes based on distance costs associated with accessing neighborhoods throughout the city. Optimized routes were used to estimate the relative cost of accessing neighborhoods for mosquito control services in Machala, creating a visual tool to guide decision makers and maximize mosquito control program efficiency. Location-allocation analyses were performed to evaluate efficiency gains of moving service deployment to other available locations with respect to distance to service hub, neighborhood population, dengue incidence, and housing condition. Results: Using this framework, we identified different locations for targeting mosquito control efforts, dependent upon management goals and specified risk factors of interest, including human population, housing condition, and reported dengue incidence. Our models indicate that neighborhoods on the periphery of Machala with the poorest housing conditions are the most costly to access. Optimal locations of facilities for deployment of control services change depending on pre-determined management priorities, increasing the population served via inexpensive routes up to 34.9%, and reducing overall cost of accessing neighborhoods up to 12.7%. Conclusions: Our transportation network models indicate that current locations of mosquito control facilities in Machala are not ideal for minimizing driving distances or maximizing populations served. Services may be optimized by moving vector control operations to other existing public health facilities in Machala. This work represents a first step in creating a spatial tool for planning and critically evaluating the systematic delivery of mosquito control services in Machala and elsewhere.","Lippi, C.

Chemo-radiotherapy yields a 50% 3-year relapse-free survival rate in advanced anal cancer, so improved predictive markers and therapeutic options are needed. Methods: High-throughput proteomics and whole-exome sequencing were performed in 46 paraffin samples from anal squamous cell carcinoma patients. Hierarchical clustering was used to establish groups de novo. Then, probabilistic graphical models were used to study the differences between groups of patients at the biological process level. Results: A molecular classification into two groups of patients was established, one group with increased expression of proteins related to adhesion, T lymphocytes and glycolysis; and the other group with increased expression of proteins related to translation and ribosomes. The probabilistic graphical model showed that these two groups presented differences in metabolism, mitochondria, translation, splicing and adhesion processes. Additionally, these groups showed different frequencies of genetic variants in some genes, such as ATM, SLFN11 and DST. Finally, genetic and proteomic characteristics of these groups suggested the use of some possible targeted therapies, such as PARP inhibitors or immunotherapy. Conclusions: In this study, a molecular classification of anal squamous cell carcinoma using high-throughput proteomics and whole-exome sequencing data was proposed. Moreover, differences between the two established groups suggested some possible therapies.","Trilla-Fuertes, L.; Ghanem, I.; Gamez-Pozo, A.; Maurel, J.; G-Pastrian, L.; Mendiola, M.; Pena, C.; Lopez-Vacas, R.; Prado-Vazquez, G.; Lopez-Camacho, E.; Zapater-Moros, A.; Heredia, V.; Cuatrecasas, M.; Garcia-Alfonso, P.; Capdevila, J.; Conill, C.; Garcia-Carbonero, R.; Ramos-Ruiz, R.; Fortes, C.; Llorens, C.; Nanni, P.; Fresno, J.

629,"Elevated heart rate after non-cardiac surgery: post-hoc analysis of a prospective observational cohort study","Background: Elevated heart rate (HR) is associated with accelerated mortality and independently predicts poorer outcomes in patients discharged from hospital after myocardial infarction and/or heart failure. We examined whether resting HR measured within 24 hours of hospital discharge following elective non-cardiac surgery was elevated compared to preoperative values. We also investigated the relationship between changes in HR and autonomic function associated with morbidity after surgery. Methods: We conducted a post-hoc analysis of HR data obtained in a prospective observational cohort study of patients >18years in whom serial Holter-based measurements of cardiac autonomic activity were made before, and for 48h after, surgery. The primary outcome was absolute discharge HR (beats minute-1), recorded at rest before hospital discharge. We examined the association between quartiles of discharge HR and autonomic measures (time/frequency domain heart rate variability) associated with morbidity (defined by the Postoperative Morbidity Survey). Results: In 157 patients (66 (42%) male; age 67(9) years), HR at hospital discharge (range: 53-122) increased by 5 beats minute-1 (95%CI:3-7;p<0.001) compared to preoperative values. Patients in the upper quartile of discharge HR (>87bpm) were more likely to sustain pulmonary (odds ratio (OR):2.18 (95%CI:1.07-4.44);p=0.03) and infectious (OR:2.31 (95%CI:1.13-4.75);p=0.02) morbidity within seven days of surgery, compared to lower quartiles. Pulmonary/infectious morbidity was associated with loss of cardiac vagal activity.

556,"Simulation models of dengue transmission in Funchal, Madeira Island: influence of seasonality","The recent emergence and established presence of Aedes aegypti in the Autonomous Region of Madeira, Portugal, was responsible for the first autochthonous outbreak of dengue in Europe. The island has not reported any dengue cases since the outbreak in 2012. However, there is a high risk that an introduction of the virus would result in another autochthonous outbreak given the presence of the vector and permissive environmental conditions. Understanding the dynamics of a potential epidemic is critical for targeted local control strategies. Here, we adopt a deterministic model for the transmission of dengue in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The model integrates empirical and mechanistic parameters for virus transmission, under seasonally varying temperatures for Funchal, Madeira Island. We examine the epidemic dynamics as triggered by the arrival date of an infectious individual; the influence of seasonal temperature mean and variation on the epidemic dynamics; and performed a sensitivity analysis on the following quantities of interest: the epidemic peak size, time to peak and the final epidemic size. Our results demonstrate the potential for summer to early winter transmission of dengue, with the arrival date significantly affecting the distribution of the timing and peak size of the epidemic. Mid-summer to early autumn arrivals are more likely to produce larger epidemics within a short peak time. Epidemics within this favorable period had an average of 18% of the susceptible population infected at the peak, at an average peak time of 70 days. We also demonstrated that seasonal temperature variation dramatically affects the epidemic dynamics, with warmer starting temperatures producing peaks more quickly after an introduction and larger epidemics. Overall, our quantities of interest were most sensitive to variance in the date of arrival, seasonal temperature, biting rate, transmission rates, and the mosquito population; the magnitude of sensitivity differs across quantities. Our model could serve as a useful guide in the development of effective local control and mitigation strategies for dengue fever in Madeira Island.","Salami, D.; Capinha, C.; Sousa, C.

557,"Hepatitis B virus resistance to tenofovir: fact or fiction? A synthesis of the evidence to date","Background: Tenofovir (TFV) is a widely used antiviral treatment for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. There is a high genetic barrier to the selection of TFV resistance-associated mutations (RAMs), but the distribution and clinical significance of TFV RAMs are not well understood, and the topic remains contentious. We here present assimilated evidence for putative TFV RAMs with the aims of cataloguing and characterising mutations that have been reported, and starting to develop insights into the mechanisms of resistance and potential clinical significance. Methods: We carried out a systematic literature search in PubMed to identify clinical, in vitro and in silico evidence of TFV resistance. The structure of HBV reverse transcriptase (RT) has not been solved; we therefore compared HBV RT to the crystal structure for HIV RT to map the likely sites of RAMs. Results: We identified a long-list of 37 putative TFV RAMs in HBV RT, occurring within and outside sites of enzyme activity, some of which can be mapped onto a homologous HIV RT structure. Based on quality and quantity of supporting data, we generated a short-list of nine sites that are supported by the most robust evidence. Most resistance arises as a result of suites of multiple RAMs. Other factors including adherence, viral load, HBeAg status, HIV coinfection and NA dosage may also influence viraemic suppression. Conclusion: There is emerging evidence for polymorphisms that may reduce susceptibility to TVF. A better understanding of HBV drug resistance is imperative to optimise approaches to public health elimination targets.","Mokaya, J.; Mcnaughton, A. L.; Bester, P.

545,"Dengue importation into Europe: a network connectivity-based approach","The spread of dengue through global human mobility is a major public health concern. A key challenge is understanding the transmission pathways and mediating factors that characterized the patterns of dengue importation into non-endemic areas. Utilizing a network connectivity-based approach, we analyze the importation patterns of dengue fever into European countries. Seven connectivity indices were developed to characterize the role of the air passenger traffic, seasonality, incidence rate, geographical proximity, epidemic vulnerability, and wealth of a source country, in facilitating the transport and importation of dengue fever. We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) to examine the relationship between dengue importation and the connectivity indices while accounting for the air transport network structure. We also incorporated network autocorrelation within a GLMM framework to investigate the propensity of a European country to receive an imported case, by virtue of its position within the air transport network. The connectivity indices and dynamical processes of the air transport network were strong predictors of dengue importation in Europe. With more than 70% of the variation in dengue importation patterns explained. We found that transportation potential was higher for source countries with seasonal dengue activity, high passenger traffic, high incidence rates, lower economic status, and geographical proximity to a destination country in Europe. We also found that position of a European country within the air transport network was a strong predictor of the country' propensity to receive an imported case. Our findings provide evidence that the importation patterns of dengue into Europe can be largely explained by appropriately characterizing the heterogeneities of the source, and topology of the air transport network. This contributes to the foundational framework for building integrated predictive models for bio-surveillance of dengue importation.","Salami, D.; Capinha, C.; Martins, M. D. R. O.; Sousa, C.

604,"The Integrated Voxel Analysis Method (IVAM) to Diagnose Onset of Alzheimer's Disease and Identify Brain Regions through Structural MRI Images.","Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides three-dimensional anatomical and physiological details of the human brain. We describe the Integrated Voxel Analysis Method (IVAM) which, through machine learning, classifies MRI images of brains afflicted with early Alzheimer's Disease (AD). This fully automatic method uses an extra trees regressor model in which the feature vector input contains the intensities of voxels, whereby the effect of AD on a single voxel can be predicted. The resulting tree predicts based on the following two steps: a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm based on Euclidean distance with the feature vector to classify whole images based on their distribution of affected voxels and a voxel-by-voxel classification by the tree of every voxel in the image. An Ising model filter follows voxel-by-voxel tree-classification to remove artifacts and to facilitate clustering of classification results which identify significant voxel clusters affected by AD. We apply this method to T1-weighted MRI images obtained from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) using images belonging to normal and early AD-afflicted individuals associated with a Client Dementia Rating (CDR) which we use as the target in the supervised learning. Furthermore, statistical analysis using a pre-labeled brain atlas automatically identifies significantly affected brain regions. While achieving 90% AD classification accuracy on 198 images in the OASIS dataset, the method reveals morphological differences caused by the onset of AD.","Hur, M.; Aghajanyan, A.",20191029,"Neurology","10.1101/19009597",1,"Matthew Hur","Yale University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19009597v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19009597v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"The code for IVAM is freely available on GitHub."
538,"Exploring and mitigating potential bias when genetic instrumental variables are associated with multiple non-exposure traits in Mendelian randomization","Background: Our aim is to produce guidance on exploring and mitigating possible bias when genetic instrumental variables (IVs) associate with traits other than the exposure of interest in Mendelian randomization (MR) studies. Methods: We use causal diagrams to illustrate scenarios that could result in IVs being related to (non-exposure) traits. We recommend that MR studies explore possible IV-non-exposure associations across a much wider range of traits than is usually the case. Where associations are found, confounding by population stratification should be assessed through adjusting for relevant population structure variables. To distinguish vertical from horizontal pleiotropy we suggest using bidirectional MR between the exposure and non-exposure traits and MR of the effect of the non-exposure traits on the outcome of interest. If vertical pleiotropy is plausible, standard MR methods should be unbiased. If horizontal pleiotropy is plausible, we recommend using multivariable MR to control for observed pleiotropic traits and conducting sensitivity analyses which do not require prior knowledge of specific invalid IVs or pleiotropic paths. Results: We applied our recommendations to an illustrative example of the effect of maternal insomnia on offspring birthweight in the UK Biobank. We found little evidence that unexpected IV-non-exposure associations were driven by population stratification. Three out of six observed non-exposure traits plausibly reflected horizontal pleiotropy. Multivariable MR and sensitivity analyses suggested an inverse association of insomnia with birthweight, but effects were imprecisely estimated in some of these analyses. Conclusions: We provide guidance for MR studies where genetic IVs associate with non-exposure traits.","Yang, Q.; Sanderson, E.; Tilling, K.; Borges, M. C.; Lawlor, D.

576,"Increased Mortality in Patients with Standard EEG Findings of \""Diffuse Slowing\""","Background/Objectives: We aim to confirm the association between the high risk score on bispectral electroencephalogram (BSEEG) and mortality by comparing outcomes for those with ""diffuse slowing"" and normal findings on standard EEG. Design: This is a retrospective study conducted with patient chart data from March 2015 to March 2017. Setting: Single center study at a tertiary care academic hospital in the Midwest region of the USA. Participants: 1069 subjects aged 55 years and older who were on an inpatient floor or intensive care unit and received a standard 24-hour EEG. Measurements: Primary outcome was all-cause mortality at 30-, 90-, 180-, and 365- days. Secondary outcomes were time-to-discharge, and discharge to home. Results: Patients with ""diffuse slowing"" on standard EEG was significantly associated with 30-, 90-, 180-, and 365-day mortality (P < .001) compared to those with normal EEG findings when controlling for age, sex, and Carlson Comorbidity Index. Those with diffuse slowing also had a longer time to discharge (P < 0.001) and were less likely to discharge to home (P < 0.001) when controlling for the same factors. Findings were similar when limiting the study to only patients whose clinical status indicated ""awake"" at time of EEG, except for 30-day mortality. Conclusion: Our findings show that a standard EEG finding of ""diffuse slowing"" for inpatients 55 year or older is associated with greater mortality. This study strengthens the importance of the association found between high BSEEG score and mortality.","Wanzek, R.; Bormann, N.; Shabbir, Y.; Saito, T.; Yamada, T.; Shinozaki, G.",20191022,"Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology","10.1101/19009621",1,"Gen Shinozaki","University of Iowa","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19009621v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19009621v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"Data is available from author upon request."
543,"Trade Study of Population Age Groups for a Clinical Trial in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder","ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulty paying attention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity that is treated by an array of different modalities in order to decrease functional impairment. Despite the variety of available pharmacologic treatment options and their widespread use, there still remains a strong need to create innovative therapies. Game Based Therapy (GBT) is a type of cognitive behavioral therapy that seeks to increase the efficacy of currently available pharmacological treatments through improving cognitive deficits and reducing the current dose of such treatments. At the University of Kentucky, a clinical trial was implemented to assess the effects of combining stimulant pharmacotherapy with the popular video game Minecraft as Game Based Therapy on ADHD symptoms in children ages 10-15. However, the low subject recruitment played a large role in the trial failing to produce conclusive data from that site. This trade study serves to address the difficulties of subject recruitment and determine an optimal population and location for future adoption of the clinical trial. Through statistical analysis of state, national, and survey data it was found that in Lexington, Kentucky, 18-21 year olds are the optimal population for future GBT with pharmacotherapy clinical trials.","Lodder, R.

542,"Development of population and Bayesian models for applied use in patients receiving cefepime","Understanding exposures of cefepime, a {beta}-lactam antibiotic, is crucial for developing regimens to achieve optimal exposure and improved clinical outcomes. This study sought to develop and evaluate a unified population pharmacokinetic model in both pediatric and adult patients receiving cefepime treatment. Multiple physiologically relevant models were fit to pediatric and adult subject data. To evaluate the final model performance, a withheld group of twelve pediatric and two separate adult populations were assessed. Seventy subjects with a total of 604 cefepime concentrations were included in this study. All adults (n=34) on average weighed 82.7 kg and displayed a mean creatinine clearance (CrCL) of 106.7 mL/min. All pediatric subjects (n=36) had mean weight and CrCL of 16.0 kg and 195.64 mL/min, respectively. A covariate-adjusted two compartment model described the observed concentrations well (population model R2, 87.0%; Bayesian model R2, 96.5%). In the evaluation subsets, the model performed similarly well (population R2, 84.0%; Bayesian R2, 90.2%).

Neuropathological studies suggest early AD pathology in the entorhinal cortex (EC) of young adults at genetic risk for AD (APOE {epsilon}4-carriers). Because the EC harbors grid cells, a likely neural substrate of path integration (PI), we examined PI performance in APOE {epsilon}4-carriers during a virtual navigation task. We report a selective impairment in APOE {epsilon}4-carriers specifically when recruitment of compensatory navigational strategies via supportive spatial cues was disabled. A separate fMRI study revealed that PI performance was associated with the strength of entorhinal grid-like representations, suggesting grid cell dysfunction as a mechanistic explanation for PI deficits in APOE {epsilon}4-carriers. Furthermore, retrosplenial cortex was involved in the recruitment of compensatory navigational strategies via supportive spatial cues. Our results provide evidence for selective PI deficits in AD risk carriers, decades before potential disease onset.","Bierbrauer, A.; Kunz, L.; Gomes, C.

However, statistical comparisons of change-points between specific cognitive measures have not been reported. Methods: 165 older adults (baseline age range: 61.1-91.2) from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging developed AD during follow-up. Linear and non-linear mixed models were fit for 11 cognitive measures to determine change-points in rates of decline before AD diagnosis. Bootstrapping was used to compare the timing of change-points across cognitive measures. Results: Change-points followed by accelerated decline ranged from 15.5 years (Card Rotations) to 1.9 years (Trail-Making A) before AD diagnosis. Accelerated decline in Card Rotations occurred significantly earlier than all other measures, including learning and memory measures. Discussion: Results suggest that visuospatial ability, as assessed by Card Rotations, may have the greatest utility as an early predictive tool in identifying preclinical AD.","Williams, O.

565,"Impact of a natural disaster on access to care and biopsychosocial outcomes among Hispanic/Latino cancer survivors","Cancer is the leading cause of death in Puerto Rico (PR). Hurricane Maria (HM) and its aftermath lead to widespread devastation in the island, including the collapse of the healthcare system. Medically fragile populations, such as cancer survivors, were significantly affected. The goal of this study was to assess the impact of HM on barriers to care, emotional distress, and inflammatory biomarkers among cancer survivors in PR. This exploratory longitudinal study was conducted in health care facilities and community support groups from PR. Cancer survivors (n=50) and non-cancer participants (n=50) completed psychosocial questionnaires and provided blood samples that were used to assess inflammatory cytokines levels. Data were analyzed through descriptive, frequencies, correlational, and linear regression analyses. Cancer survivors that were affected by HM reported increased barriers in accessing medical care, which were directly associated with anxiety, perceived stress, and post-traumatic symptomatology. Moreover, being a cancer survivor, along with closeness in time from HM predicted more barriers to receiving health care. Several inflammatory cytokines, such as CD31, BDNF, TFF3, Serpin E-1, Vitamin D BP, VCAM-1, Osteopontin, Chitinase 3 like 1, MMP-9 and MIF were significantly upregulated in cancer survivors while BDNF, MMP9 and Osteopontin had significant positive correlations with barriers to care.

Thirty-six children with uCP completed an UL kinematic evaluation after participating in a 9-day mCIMT camp wearing a splint for 6 hours/day. The experimental group (mCIMT+AOT, n=20) received 15 hours of AOT, i.e. video-observation and execution of unimanual tasks. The control group (mCIMT+placebo, n=16) watched biological-motion free videos and executed the same tasks. We examined changes in motor control (movement duration, peak velocity, time-to-peak velocity, and trajectory straightness) and movement patterns (using Statistical Parametric Mapping) during the execution of three unimanual, relevant tasks before the intervention, after and at 6 months follow-up. Adding AOT to mCIMT mainly affected movement duration during reaching, whereas little benefit is seen on UL movement patterns. mCIMT, with or without AOT, improved peak velocity and trajectory straightness, and proximal movement patterns. These results highlight the importance of including kinematics in an UL evaluation to capture changes in motor control and movement patterns of the proximal joints.","Simon-Martinez, C.; Mailleux, L.; Jaspers, E.; Ortibus, E.; Desloovere, K.; Klingels, K.; Feys, H.",20191022,"Rehabilitation Medicine And Physical Therapy","10.1101/19009779",1,"Cristina Simon-Martinez","KU Leuven","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19009779v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19009779v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"Data is available upon request to the corresponding author"
1055,"Beware (surprisingly common) left-right flips in your MRI data: an efficient and robust method to check MRI dataset consistency using AFNI","Knowing the difference between left and right is generally assumed throughout the brain MRI research community. However, we note widespread occurrences of left-right orientation errors in MRI open database repositories where volumes have contained systematic left-right flips between subject EPIs and anatomicals, due to having incorrect or missing file header information. Here we present a simple method in AFNI for determining the consistency of left and right within a pair of acquired volumes for a particular subject; the presence of EPI-anatomical inconsistency, for example, is a sign that dataset header information likely requires correction. The method contains both a quantitative evaluation as well as a visualizable verification. We test the functionality using publicly available datasets. Left-right flipping is not immediately obvious in most cases, so we also present visualization methods for looking at this problem (and other potential problems), using examples from both FMRI and DTI datasets.","Glen, D.

Currently, healthcare-based disease monitoring systems in France offer influenza activity information that lags real-time by 1 to 3 weeks. This temporal data gap introduces uncertainty that prevents public health officials from having a timely perspective on the population-level disease activity. Here, we present a machine-learning modeling approach that produces real-time estimates and short-term forecasts of influenza activity for the 12 continental regions of France by leveraging multiple disparate data sources that include, Google search activity, real-time and local weather information, flu-related Twitter micro-blogs, electronic health records data, and historical disease activity synchronicities across regions. Our results show that all data sources contribute to improving influenza surveillance and that machine-learning ensembles that combine all data sources lead to accurate and timely predictions.","Poirier, C.; Hswen, Y.; Bouzille, G.; Cuggia, M.; Lavenu, A.; Brownstein, J.

579,"Sensory restoration by epidural stimulation of dorsal spinal cord in upper-limb amputees","Restoring somatosensory feedback to people with limb amputations is crucial for improving prosthesis acceptance and function. Epidural spinal cord stimulation is a commonly used clinical procedure that targets sensory neural pathways in the dorsal spinal cord to treat pain conditions. A similar approach could be developed as a clinically translatable means to restore somatosensation in amputees. We show that epidural stimulation of the dorsal spinal cord evoked sensory percepts, perceived as emanating from the amputated arm and hand, in four people with upper-limb amputation. After an initial caudal movement immediately following the implantation, the leads stabilized, exhibiting a median migration of <5 mm (each electrode contact is 3 mm long) over the remainder of the study in all the subjects. This was reflected in the consistent locations of evoked percepts in the hand across four subjects throughout the period of implantation, which lasted up to 29 days. The median change in the centroid location was 1.2 to 35.3 mm and the median change in percept area was 0 to 40%. While most of the evoked percepts were paresthetic in nature, a subset was described as naturalistic (e.g. touch or pressure) in three subjects. Modulating the stimulus amplitude affected the perceived intensity of the sensation in all subjects. A variety of sensory percepts were evoked in all subjects irrespective of the level of amputation or the time since amputation, suggesting the approach is amenable to a diverse population of amputees.","Chandrasekaran, S.; Nanivadekar, A.

571,"Presence of additional P. vivax malaria in Duffy negative individuals from Southwestern Nigeria","Malaria in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) is thought to be hugely caused by Plasmodium falciparum and very infrequently by P. ovale, P. malariae, with P. vivax not even being considered to be of any significant role. However, with the availability of very sensitive diagnostic tool, it has become more clear that, the percentage of non-falciparum malaria in this sub-region has been underestimated. P. vivax was historically thought to be absent in sSA due to the high prevalence of the Duffy null antigen in individuals residing here. Nevertheless, recent studies reporting the detection of vivax malaria in Duffy-negative individuals challenges this notion. Following our earlier report of P. vivax in Duffy-negative individuals, we have re-assessed all previous samples following the classical PCR method and sequencing to confirm both single/mixed infections as well as the Duffy status of the individuals. Interestingly, fifteen additional Plasmodium infections were detected, representing 5.9% in prevalence from our earlier work. In addition, P. vivax represents 26.7% (4/15) of the new isolates collected in Nigeria. Sequencing results confirmed, all vivax isolates as truly vivax malaria and their Duffy status to be that of the Duffy-negative genotype. The identification of more vivax isolates among these Duffy-negative individuals from Nigeria, substantiate the expanding body of evidence of the ability of P. vivax to infect RBCs that do not express the DARC gene. Hence, such geno-epidemiological study should be conducted at the national level in order to evaluate the actual burden of P. vivax in the country.","Oboh, M. A.; Singh, U.

609,"Short-term mental health sequelae of bereavement predict long-term physical health decline in older adults: US Health and Retirement Study Analysis","Objective. Death of a spouse is a common late-life event with mental- and physical-health sequelae. Whereas mental-health sequelae of spousal death tend to be transient, physical-health sequelae may persist, leading to disability and mortality. Growing evidence linking poor mental health to aging-related disease suggests the hypothesis that transient poor mental health following death of a spouse could be a harbinger of physical health decline. If so, identification of bereavement-related mental health symptoms could provide an opportunity for prevention. Methods. We analyzed data from N=35,103 individuals followed from 1994-2014 in the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and identified N=4,629 who were widowed during follow-up. We tested change in mental and physical health from pre-bereavement through the 5-year period following spousal death. Results. Bereaved spouses experienced an immediate increase in depressive symptoms following their spouses' deaths but the depressive shock attenuated within one year. Bereaved spouses also experienced increases in disability, chronic-disease morbidity, and hospitalization, which grew in magnitude with time since spousal death, especially among older HRS participants. Bereaved spouses were at increased risk of death compared to HRS participants who were not bereaved. The magnitude of depressive symptoms in the immediate aftermath of spousal death predicted physical-health decline and mortality risk over 5 years of follow-up. Conclusions. Bereavement-related depressive symptoms provide an indicator of risk for physical health decline and death in older adults. Screening for depressive symptoms in bereaved older adults may represent an opportunity for intervention to preserve healthy lifespan.","Domingue, B. W.; Duncan, L.; Harrati, A.; Belsky, D.

570,"COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS FOR HPV MITIGATION STRATEGIES IMPLEMENTED IN 2018 IN THE REPUBLIC OF MOLDOVA BASED ON INFECTIOUS DISEASE MODELLING","Human papillomavirus (HPV), is a sexually transmittable virus infection, which is necessary risk factor for developing cervical cancer, first killer in working age women in Moldova. Since 2018 Moldova has modified screening program and vaccination program (mainly externally funded). To assess the performance of the mitigation policy we propose cost-effectiveness analysis according to 2 already implemented strategies. (1) Vaccination of a single age-cohort, although vaccinating a single cohort may not have a substantial effect in other countries with distinct socio-economic situation. (2) Transition to more technologically advance screening ecosystem (changing from Romanowski to Pap smear), which might not necessary be cost-efficient in low resource settings (if GDP per capita will not growth substantially at the same time). (1)We verified that single cohort vaccination is both cost-beneficial (total costs reduction will balance intervention costs around the year 2040) and cost-efficient (with incremental impact in 20 years perspective on the level of 2300 EUR/QALY). Moreover, we found out that single year cohort is more beneficial than 5-years cohort vaccination scenarios in our mathematical model. This behaviour could be explained by a transitional situation in Moldova (HPV epidemic is near outbreak threshold), still small changes of model parameters and initial conditions could cause strong effect in the epidemiology. However, a definitive answer cannot be given with the chosen methodology. (2)Transition between Romanowski -> Pap smear cytology in screening benefits unquestionably in epidemiology e.g. due to higher specificity. However, further maintenance and higher procedure costs could exceed treatment costs, hence intervention costs would gather unacceptable share in whole national limited resources dedicated to public health.","Jarynowski, A.",20191022,"Epidemiology","10.1101/19009886",1,"Andrzej Jarynowski","Institute for Interdisciplinary Research","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19009886v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19009886v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"Model (Vensim), data (e. g.

595,"Functional MRI connectivity accurately distinguishes cases with psychotic disorders from healthy controls, based on cortical features associated with neurodevelopment","Background: Machine learning (ML) can distinguish cases with psychotic disorder from healthy controls based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, with reported accuracy in the range 60-100%. It is not yet clear which MRI metrics are the most informative for case-control ML. Methods: We analysed multi-modal MRI data from two independent case-control studies of patients with psychotic disorders (cases, N = 65, 28; controls, N = 59, 80) and compared ML accuracy across 5 MRI metrics. Cortical thickness, mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy were estimated at each of 308 cortical regions, as well as functional and structural connectivity between each pair of regions. Functional connectivity data were also used to classify non-psychotic siblings of cases (N=64) and to distinguish cases from controls in a third independent study (cases, N=67; controls, N=81). Results: In both principal studies, the most diagnostic metric was fMRI connectivity: the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 92% and 77%, respectively. The cortical map of diagnostic connectivity features was replicable between studies (r = 0.31, P < 0.001); correlated with replicable case-control differences in fMRI degree centrality, and with prior cortical maps of aerobic glycolysis and adolescent development of functional connectivity; predicted intermediate probabilities of psychosis in siblings; and replicated in the third case-control study. Conclusions: ML most accurately distinguished cases from controls by a replicable pattern of fMRI connectivity features, highlighting abnormal hubness of cortical nodes in an anatomical pattern consistent with the concept of psychosis as a disorder of network development.","Morgan, S.

593,"Evaluation of the General Practice Pharmacist (GPP) intervention to optimise prescribing in Irish primary care: a non-randomised pilot study","Objective: Limited evidence suggests integration of pharmacists into the general practice team could improve medicines management for patients, particularly those with multimorbidity and polypharmacy. This study aimed to develop and assess the feasibility of an intervention involving pharmacists, working within general practices, to optimise prescribing in Ireland. Design: Non-randomised pilot study Setting: Primary care in Ireland Participants: Four general practices, purposively sampled and recruited to reflect a range of practice sizes and demographic profiles. Intervention: A pharmacist joined the practice team for six months (10 hours/week) and undertook medication reviews (face-to-face or chart-based) for adult patients, provided prescribing advice, supported clinical audits, and facilitated practice-based education. Outcome measures: Anonymised practice-level medication (e.g. medication changes) and cost data were collected. Patient-Reported Outcome Measure (PROM) data were collected on a subset of older adults (aged [&ge;]65 years) with polypharmacy using patient questionnaires, before and six weeks after medication review by the pharmacist. Results: Across four practices, 787 patients were identified as having 1,521 prescribing issues by the pharmacists. Issues relating to potentially inappropriate or high-risk prescribing were addressed most often by the prescriber (51.8%), compared to cost-related issues (7.5%). Medication changes made during the study equated to approximately {euro}57,000 in cost savings assuming they persisted for 12 months. Ninety-six patients aged [&ge;]65 years with polypharmacy were recruited from the four practices for PROM data collection and 64 (66.7%) were followed up. There were no changes in patients' treatment burden or attitudes to deprescribing following medication review, and there were conflicting changes in patients' self-reported quality of life. Conclusions: This non-randomised pilot study demonstrated that an intervention involving pharmacists, working within general practices is feasible to implement and has potential to improve prescribing quality. This study provides rationale to conduct a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of this intervention.","Cardwell, K.; Smith, S.

584,"Micro-costing Diagnostics in Oncology: From Single-Gene Testing to Whole Genome Sequencing","Purpose: Predictive diagnostics play an increasingly important role in personalized medicine for cancer treatment. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) based treatment selection is expected to rapidly increase worldwide. Detailed and comparative cost analyses of diagnostic techniques are an essential element in decision-making. This study aimed to calculate and compare the total cost of currently used diagnostic techniques and of WGS in treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), melanoma, colorectal cancer (CRC) and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) in the Netherlands. Methods: The activity-based costing (ABC) method was conducted to calculate the total cost of included diagnostic techniques based on data provided by Dutch pathology laboratories and the Dutch centralized cancer WGS facility. Costs were allocated to four categories: capital costs, maintenance costs, software costs and operational costs. Outcome measures were total cost per cancer patient per included technique, and the total cost per cancer patient per most commonly applied technique (combination) for each cancer type. Results: The total cost per cancer patient per technique varied from 58 euro (Sanger sequencing, 3 amplicons) to 4738 euro (paired tumor-normal WGS). The operational costs accounted for the vast majority over 90 % of the total per cancer patient technique costs. The most important operational cost drivers were consumables followed by personnel (for sample preparation and primary data analysis). Conclusion: This study outlined in detail all costing aspects and cost prices of current and new diagnostic modalities used in treatment of NSCLC, melanoma, CRC and GIST in the Netherlands. Detailed cost differences and value comparisons between these diagnostic techniques enable future economic evaluations to support decision-making on implementation of WGS and other diagnostic modalities in routine clinical practice.","Pasmans, C.

690,"Cost-effectiveness of the next generation of RSV intervention strategies","Background: With a suite of promising new RSV prophylactics on the horizon, including long-acting monoclonal antibodies and new vaccines, it is likely that one or more of these will replace the current monoclonal Palivizumab programme. However, choosing the optimal intervention programme will require balancing the costs of the programmes with the health benefits accrued. Methods: To compare the next generation of RSV prophylactics, we integrated a novel transmission model with an economic analysis. We estimated key epidemiological parameters by calibrating the model to seven years of historical epidemiological data using a Bayesian approach. We determined the cost-effective and affordable maximum purchase price for a comprehensive suite of intervention programmes. Findings: Our transmission model suggests that maternal protection of infants is seasonal, with 2-14% of infants born with protection against RSV. Our economic analysis found that to cost-effectively and affordably replace the current monoclonal antibody Palivizumab programme with long-acting monoclonal antibodies, the purchase price per dose would have to be less than around 4,350 but dropping to 200 for vaccinated heightened risk infants or 90 for all infants. A seasonal maternal vaccine would have to be priced less than 85 to be cost-effective and affordable. While vaccinating pre-school and school-age children is likely not cost-effective relative to elderly vaccination programmes, vaccinating the elderly is not likely to be affordable. Conversely, vaccinating infants at 2 months seasonally would be cost-effective and affordable if priced less than 80. Interpretations: In a setting with seasonal RSV epidemiology, maternal protection conferred to newborns is also seasonal, an assumption not previously incorporated in transmission models of RSV. For a country with seasonal RSV dynamics like England, seasonal programmes rather than year-round intervention programmes are always optimal.","Hodgson, D.; Panovska-Griffiths, J.; Pebody, R.; Baguelin, M.; Atkins, K.",20191105,"Public And Global Health","10.1101/19009977",3,"David Hodgson","UCL","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19009977v3?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19009977v3.full.pdf","cc_by_nc",NA,"All non-patient sensitive data and modelling code are available online on David Hodgson's github account (see link)"

In addition, undergraduate health sciences students need additional money when they start clinical placement learning. Objectives: to explore the economic challenges that clinical year undergraduate health sciences students face with limited pocket money; and students' perceive of how limited pocket money affects their learning activities and how they react to challenges. Methods: The descriptive qualitative study was conducted at Addis Ababa University (AAU) , College of Health Sciences(CHS) Medical Radiology Technology (MRT) department at Addis Ababa University. Ten participants recruited through purposive and snowball method; and the semi-structured interviews took place from January 28, 2019 to February 1, 2019. The Semi-structured questions explored participants' experiences and perceptions regarding challenges of lack of pocket money and its impacts on their learning activities, and their reaction to financial challenges. Results: Four themes emerged from the interviews based on the research objectives, and they are challenges of getting pocket money, difficulty of affording important needs, self-management; and social life. Conclusion: Based on the data, the underlying causes that lead students to face financial hardships can be solved by making public awareness regarding university expenses, clarifying the cost sharing system to the public, redesigning the cost sharing policy, improving university administration. In addition, giving short training to students on self-management and money management skills and, as well giving special attention to clinical practice facilities primarily concluded from the participants' descriptions.

586,"Direct medical costs of hospitalized patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in China","Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown cause. The incidence of IPF is increasing year by year, as well as the mortality rates, which is really a burden both for the family and the society. However few data concerning the economic burden of the patients with IPF is available, especially in China. Objective This study aimed to examine the direct medical costs of hospitalized patients with IPF and to determine the contributing factors. Methods This retrospective analysis used the cost-of-illness framework in order to analyze the direct medical costs of patients with IPF. The study used data from the pneumology department of Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University from year 2012 to 2015. The direct medical costs included drug fee, auxiliary examination fee, treatment fee and other fee. Patients' characteristics, medical treatment, and the direct medical costs were analyzed by descriptive statistics and multivariable regression. Results There were 219 hospitalized patients meeting the diagnosis of IPF, 91% male. The mean age was 65 years old. For the direct medical costs of hospitalized patients with IPF, the mean(SD) of the total costs per IPF patient per admission was 14882.3 (30975.8)CNY. The largest parts were the examination fee of 6034.5 (15651.2)CNY and the drug fee of 5048.9 (3855.1)CNY. By regression analysis we found that length of stay , emergency treatment, ventilator use and being a Beijing native were significantly (P<0.05) associated with total hospitalization costs, and the length of stay had the biggest impact. Complications or comorbidities contributated to the direct medical costs as follows: respiratory failure with 30898.3CNY ( P=0.004), pulmonary arterial hypertension(PAH) with 26898.2CNY (P=0.098), emphysema with 25368.3CNY ( P=0.033), and high blood pressure with 24659.4CNY (P=0.026). Using DLCO or DLCO% pred to reflect the severity of IPF, there was no significant correlation between DLCO or DLCO% pred and patients' direct medical costs. While, the worse the diffusion function, the higher the drug fee. Conclusion This study showed that IPF has a major impact on the direct medical costs. Thus, appropriate long-term interventions are recommended to lower the economic burden of IPF.","Zheng, X.; Xie, B.; Liu, Y.; Zhu, M.; Zhang, S.; Ban, C.; Geng, J.; Jiang, D.; Ren, Y.; Dai, H.; Wang, C.",20191024,"Health Economics","10.1101/19010025",1,"Huaping Dai","Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Center of Respiratory Medicine, China-Japan Friendship Hospital; National Clinical Research Center for Respi","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19010025v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19010025v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"Data sharing statement: The data sets used for this study are available"

Method: Using video recordings of the procedure, we defined a performance metric. This was brought to a modified Delphi meeting, where consensus was reached by an expert panel. To demonstrate construct validity, we used the metric to objectively assess the performance of novices and expert practitioners. Results: A phlebotomy metric consisting of 11 phases and 77 steps was developed. The mean inter-rater reliability was 0.91 (min 0.83, max 0.95). The Expert group completed more steps of the procedure (72 Vs 69), made 69% fewer errors (19 vs 13, p = 0.014) and 300% fewer critical errors (1 Vs 4, p = 0.002) than the Novice Group.

716,"Machine learning-based imaging biomarkers improve statistical power in clinical trials","Radiomic models, which leverage complex imaging patterns and machine learning, are increasingly accurate in predicting patient response to treatment and clinical outcome on an individual patient basis. In this work, we show that this predictive power can be utilized in clinical trials to significantly increase statistical power to detect treatment effects or reduce the sample size required to achieve a given power. Akin to the historical control paradigm, we propose to utilize a radiomic prediction model to generate a pseudo-control sample for each individual in the trial of interest. We then incorporate these pseudo-controls into the analysis of the clinical trial of interest using classical and well established statistical tools, and investigate statistical power. Effectively, this approach utilizes each individual's radiomics-based predictor of outcome for comparison with the actual outcome, potentially increasing statistical power considerably, depending on the accuracy of the predictor. In simulations of treatment effects based on real radiomic predictive models from brain cancer and prodromal Alzheimer's Disease, we show that this methodology can decrease the required sample sizes by as much as a half, depending on the strength of the radiomic predictor. We further find that this method is most helpful when treatment effect sizes are small and that power grows with the accuracy of radiomic prediction.","Lou, C.; Habes, M.; Davatzikos, C.; Shinohara, R.

602,"Awareness and knowledge of interventional radiology among medical students at an Indian institution","Purpose: Interventional radiology (IR) is a novel and evolving sub-specialty that encompasses image guided diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. With the advent of new imaging techniques and an increasing demand of minimally invasive procedures, IR continues to grow as a core component in medical and surgical therapeutics. Radiology teaching is a part of medical undergraduate curriculum; however, the medical undergraduate cohort lacks exposure to IR principles, methods and techniques. The purpose of this study is to determine the knowledge and awareness of IR among medical students in a single university in India. Materials and Methods: Electronic anonymous surveys were sent to 350 medical students of Pt. JNM Medical College, Raipur, India. Each survey comprised of questions assessing knowledge and exposure to IR. A total of 70 students (20%) responded. Results: 85.7% of respondents positively reported that radiologists have a role in diagnostic as well as therapeutic interventions, however, 60% students cited a very poor/poor knowledge of IR. A larger part, 91.5%, stated that they would be interested in IR based teaching delivered as a part of their undergraduate teaching program. Those who knew at least one interventional radiology technique were 1.51 (95% CI: 1.02 - 2.22; p < 0.05) times more likely to be considering it as a career. Conclusion: Medical Students demonstrate a poor knowledge of IR. This corresponds to a limited and inconsistent exposure to IR in medical schools. The study suggests that there is a need to deliver an IR based curriculum in medical undergraduate teaching in India.","Agrawal, D.; Renfrew, M.

610,"Isolating Effects of Medicare Code Slot Expansion on Longitudinal Risk Assessment","Background: The evaluation of trends in patient outcomes requires adjustment for the changes in case-mix over time and, thus, could be influenced by the expansion of code slots on inpatient claims that occurred in January 2011. We tested the hypothesis that the changes in code slots caused an artifactual increase in the case mix over time compared with a strategy that restricted inpatient codes to the same number of slots over time, excluding consideration of codes beyond the first 9 after the expansion. Methods: In Medicare claims over a 5-year period spanning the inpatient code slot expansion (2008-2012), we created cohorts of hospitalizations for heart failure (HF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and pneumonia, common hospitalization conditions included in federal policies. We obtained information on risk factors for 30-day post-discharge mortality or readmission for each condition from inpatient facility Medicare claims, outpatient facility claims and professional (or carrier) claims. We evaluated the effects of additional codes captured from the expanded slots in inpatient claims on the number of risk factors or model covariates, overall and based on their contribution to the risk of mortality or readmission. We modelled the effects of code expansion on risk-assessment using an interrupted time series framework. Results: There were 2,102,509 eligible hospitalizations for HF, 872,734 for AMI and 1,824,079 for pneumonia. The average number of risk factors increased across all covariate selection strategies. There was a larger increase in monthly average covariate count that included all codes at the time of the code slot increase relative to a strategy that consistently used only 9 inpatient codes (level change in interrupted time series model, 0.9% [95% CI 0.7% to 1.1%] in HF, 0.6% [0.5% to 0.7%] for AMI and 0.6% [0.4% to 0.8%] for pneumonia). Using both inpatient and outpatient/carrier codes for assessing risk factors, there was a smaller difference between strategies using 9 inpatient codes, compared with all inpatient claims (relative excess increase in covariates by 0.6% [0.4% to 0.8%] in HF, 0.4% [0.3% to 0.5%] for AMI, and 0.3% [0.1% to 0.6%] in pneumonia). However, the additional codes were limited to covariates with small contributions to the risk-adjustment models for mortality, without a significant inflection in measured risk of mortality across code expansion (P>0.05 in interrupted time-series models). Measured readmission risk increased with using only inpatient claims for risk assessment, but not if all outpatient and carrier claims were also used (P>0.05 in interrupted time-series models). Conclusions: The expansion of inpatient code slots did not meaningfully affect the measurement of the risk of mortality or readmission, especially if comprehensive inpatient and outpatient claims are used, because the additional covariates only included conditions with a modest influence on risk adjusted models. The use of all versus limited codes after the code slot expansion has a minimal effect on evaluating trends in these conditions.","Khera, R.; Altaf, F.; Wang, Y.; Bernheim, S.

We introduce DeepProg, a new computational framework that robustly predicts patient survival subtypes based on multiple types of omic data, using an ensemble of deep-learning and machine-learning models. We apply DeepProg on 32 cancer datasets from TCGA and identified multiple cancer survival subtypes. Patient survival risk-stratification based on DeepProg is significantly better (p-value=7.9e-7 log-rank test) than Similarity Network Fusion based multi-omics data integration in all cancer types. Further comprehensive pan-cancer comparative analysis unveils the genomic signatures common among all the poorest survival subtypes, with genes enriched in extracellular matrix modeling, immune deregulation, and mitosis processes. Furthermore, models built on closely related cancer types using DeepProg are predictive of the subtypes of some other cancers, demonstrating the utility of DeepProg for transfer learning.","Poirion, O.

616,"Prediction of Colorectal Cancer Risk Based on Profiling with Common Genetic Variants","Background: Stratifying the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) based on polygenic risk scores (PRSs) within populations has the potential to optimize screening and develop targeted prevention strategies. Methods: A metaanalysis of eleven genome wide association studies (GWAS), comprising 16 871 cases and 26 328 controls, was performed to capture CRC susceptibility variants. Genetic models with several candidate PRSs were generated from Scottish CRC case control studies (6478 cases and 11 043 controls) for prediction of overall and site specific CRC. Model performance was validated in UK Biobank (4800 cases and 20 287 controls). The 10-year absolute risk of CRC was estimated by modelling PRS with age and sex using the CRC incidence and mortality rates in the UK population. Findings: A weighted PRS including 116 CRC SNPs (wPRS116) showed the strongest performance. Deconstructing the PRS into multiple genetic risk regional scores or inclusion of additional SNPs that did not reach genome wide significance did not provide any further improvement on predictive performance. The odds ratio (OR) for CRC risk per SD of wPRS116 in Scottish dataset was 1.46 (95%CI: 1.41 to 1.50, c statistics: 0.603). Consistent estimates were observed in UK Biobank (OR=1.49, 95%CI: 1.44 to 1.54, c statistics: 0.610) and showed no substantial heterogeneity among tumor sites. Compared to the middle quintile, those in the highest 1% of PRSs had 3.25 fold higher risk and those in the lowest 1% had 0.32 fold lower risk of developing CRC. Modelling PRS with age and sex in the general UK population allows the identification of a high risk group with 10 year absolute risk >5%. Interpretation: By optimizing wPRS116, we show that genetic factors increase predictive performance but this increment is equivalent to the extraction of only one tenth of the genetic susceptibility. When employing genetic risk profiling in population settings it provides a degree of risk discrimination that could, in principle, be integrated into population based screening programs.","Li, X.; Timofeeva, M.; Spiliopoulou, A.; Mckeigue, P.

608,"Clinical Laboratory Validation and Implementation of Quantitative, Real-Time PCR-based Monitoring of NPM1 Type A Mutation","NPM1 is frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the mutations consist of a variety of small insertions; the most common NPM1 mutation (ie, Type A) accounts for approximately 80% of all NPM1 mutations. NPM1 mutations have been reported to have prognostic significance in AML and, more recently, monitoring mutant NPM1 levels during and after therapy has been described to predict relapse and survival. Despite the published relevance of this molecular biomarker, routine residual disease monitoring for mutant NPM1 levels has not been widely adopted in many academic clinical laboratories. In this manuscript, we present the validation and implementation of a quantitative, real-time PCR-based method for the monitoring of NPM1 Type A mutant transcripts, for use in routine practice in a clinical laboratory. We have found that this assay format is sensitive and reproducible. We describe the rigorous validation procedure and share observations that will help other clinical laboratories that may wish to implement this type of testing. We show comparison of the results from this assay to other assays and a representative case is provided which highlights the utility of the findings from this assay. Taken together, in the context of molecular testing for residual disease in AML, which is an area of practice that continues to expand, we have found that this method and protocol will serve as an appropriate option for monitoring NPM1 Type A mutation levels in clinical practice.","Racchumi, J.; Tam, W.; Kluk, M.

617,"The Impact of Scaling up Dolutegravir on Antiretroviral Resistance in South Africa","Background: Rising resistance of HIV-1 to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) threatens the success of the global scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART). The switch to WHO-recommended dolutegravir (DTG)-based regimens could reduce this threat due to DTG's high genetic barrier to resistance. We used mathematical modelling to examine the impact of the scale-up of DTG-based ART on NNRTI pre-treatment drug resistance (PDR) in South Africa, 2019-2040. Methods and results: We adapted the MARISA (Modelling Antiretroviral drug Resistance In South Africa) model, an epidemiological model of the transmission of NNRTI resistance in South Africa. We modelled the introduction of DTG in 2019 under two scenarios: DTG as first-line regimen for ART-initiators, or DTG for all patients, including patients on suppressive NNRTI-based ART. Due to safety concerns related to DTG during pregnancy, we assessed the impact of prescribing DTG to all men and in addition to i) women beyond reproductive age, ii) women beyond reproductive age or using contraception, and iii) all women. The model projections show that, compared to the continuation of NNRTI-based ART, introducing DTG would lead to a reduction in NNRTI resistance in all scenarios if both ART initiators are started on a DTG-based regimens and those on NNRTI-based regimens are rapidly switched to DTG. NNRTI resistance would continue to increase if DTG-based ART was restricted to men. When given to all men and women, DTG-based ART could reduce the level of NNRTI resistance from 58.5% (without DTG) to 14.8% (with universal DTG) in 2040. If all men and women beyond reproductive age or on contraception are started on or switched to DTG-based ART, NNRTI resistance would reach 35.1% in 2040. Conclusions: Our model shows the potential benefit of scaling up DTG-based regimens for halting the rise of NNRTI resistance. Starting or switching all men and women to DTG would lead to a sustained decline in resistance levels whereas using DTG-based ART in all men, or in men and women beyond childbearing age, would slow down the increase in levels of NNRTI resistance.","Hauser, A.; Kusejko, K.; Johnson, L.

We applied whole genome sequencing to identify putative transmission clusters among clinical isolates of H30 from children across the U.S. Of 126 isolates, 17 were involved in 8 putative transmission clusters; 4 clusters involved isolates with some evidence of healthcare-associated epidemiologic linkages. Geographic clustering analyses showed weak geographic clustering. These findings are consistent with a framework where within-hospital transmission is not a main contributor to the propagation of H30 in a pediatric setting.","Miles-Jay, A.; Weissmann, S.

701,"Specific Symptom Profiles are Associated with Distinct Changes in Amygdala Connectivity in Youth","Complex clinical presentations are common in youth seeking mental health treatment, complicating attempts to identify specific biological underpinnings to guide precision psychiatry. We defined four classes of such youth based on their symptom profiles and identified unique patterns of amygdala functional connectivity in each class. Subjects were 215 youth who varied along major symptom dimensions commonly associated with pediatric affective psychopathology: depression, irritability, anxiety, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD). We used latent profile analysis to identify classes of symptom patterns. Functional MRI data were obtained while subjects completed a gender identification task of face-emotions that varied in emotion type and intensity. We used generalized psychophysiological interaction analysis to examine associations between the probability of being in each symptom class and amygdala functional connectivity. The likelihood of being in the class with high parent-reported irritability and ADHD symptoms was associated with amygdala connectivity to the insula and superior temporal gyrus while processing high-intensity angry and fearful faces; to the precuneus while processing intensity across emotions; and to the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex across all task conditions. The likelihood of being in the class with high anxious and depressive symptoms was negatively associated with amygdala-thalamic connectivity across task conditions. This is the first study to identify distinct associations between symptom profile classes and amygdala connectivity in a transdiagnostic sample of youth. These neural correlates provide external validity to latent classes derived from symptom clusters. This is an essential first step toward identifying the biological basis of common transdiagnostic symptom presentations in youth.","Stoddard, J.; Kircanski, K.; Haller, S. P.; Hinton, K.

614,"Potential Predictive Factors for Breast Cancer Subtypes from a North Cyprus Cohort Analysis","More than three hundreds North Cyprus breast cancer patients with subtype information are surveyed for their demographic, reproductive, genetic, epidemiological factors. Despite the fact that our cohort differs significantly from some larger cohorts (e.g., the Breast Cancer Family Registry (BCFR) with samples from USA/Canada/Australia) in age, menopause status, age of menarche, parity, education level, oral contraceptive use, breast feeding, the distribution of breast subtypes is not significantly different. Using regularized regressions, we show that the estrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) subtype is positively related to post-menopause and negatively associated with hormone therapy; the estrogen-receptor-positive and progesterone-receptor-positive (ER+/PR+) subtype is positively associated with breast feeding, and negatively associated with hormone therapy status. On the other hand, the human epidermal growth factor 2 positive (HER2+) subtype, which itself is negatively correlated with ER+ and ER+/PR+, is positively related to having first-degree-relative with cancer, and negatively associated with post-menopause. Single and multiple regression also identify older age to be positively correlated to ER+ and ER+/PR+ subtypes, and negatively correlated to HER2+ subtype. Assuming ER+ and ER+/PR+ subtypes to have better prognostic, then post-menopause and breast-feeding are beneficial, and hormone therapy treatment is detrimental.","Ulgen, A.; Gurkut, O.; Li, W.",20191029,"Epidemiology","10.1101/19010181",1,"Wentian Li","The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19010181v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19010181v1.full.pdf","cc_by",NA,"individual person's data is not available. summary data is available upon request."

In this study, we investigate the interobserver concordance of digital morphometry, and correlate the results with established prognostic markers. The average number of cells analyzed in each of 27 tumors, was 1957 (SD 349). Mean time consumption was less than 2.5 minutes per tumor. Identical morphometric classification was obtained for [&ge;] 85 % of tumors in all twelve evaluated morphometric variables ({kappa} 0.70-0.93). The mean nucleus area, nucleus perimeter, nucleus max caliper and nucleus to cell area ratio were significantly greater in tumors with low nuclear BRCA associated protein-1 expression (nBAP-1) and gene expression class 2. Patients had significantly shorter metastasis-free survival if their tumors had low nBAP-1 expression (Log-Rank p=0.002), gene expression class 2 (Log-Rank p=0.004) or tumor cell nuclei with long max calipers (Log-Rank p=0.004) as defined in a training cohort and then tested in a validation cohort. We conclude that digital morphometry can be fast and highly reproducible, that for the first time, morphometry parameters can be objectively quantitated in thousands of cells at a time, and that variables describing the shape and size of the nuclei correlate to nBAP-1 expression, gene expression class and prognosis in uveal melanoma.","Herrspiegel, C.; See, T.

Design: Two prospective cohort studies Setting: Population-based using data from the UK Clinical Practice Datalink linked with Hospital Episode Statistics (2002-2016), and the US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare database (2008-2013). Participants: 10005 and 22027 postmenopausal women with breast cancer in the UK and US respectively. Exposures: Aromatase inhibitor compared with tamoxifen use; the US cohort additionally included a comparison with an unexposed group of women with oestrogen or progesterone receptor positive breast cancer but no endocrine therapy use. Outcomes: 12 clinically relevant individual cardiovascular outcomes (and two composite coronary and venous thromboembolic outcomes) Results: In both the UK and the US, there was evidence of an increased risk of coronary artery disease in aromatase inhibitor compared with tamoxifen users (UK incidence rate: 10.18 vs 6.87 per 1000 person-years, HR: 1.29, 0.94-1.76; US incidence rate: 35.26 vs 26.95 per 1000 person-years, HR: 1.29, 1.06-1.55), but the US data showed no increase in risk compared with the unexposed group (incidence rate for tamoxifen vs unexposed: 26.95 vs 38.70 per 1000 person-years, HR: 0.74, 0.60-0.92; incidence rate for aromatase inhibitors vs unexposed: 35.26 vs 28.70, HR: 0.96, 0.83-1.10). Similar patterns were seen for other cardiovascular outcomes such as arrhythmia, heart failure, and valvular heart disease. As expected, there were more venous thromboembolic events in tamoxifen users compared with both aromatase inhibitor users and those unexposed. There was a high degree of consistency between results in the two countries. Conclusions: Increased risks of several cardiovascular diseases among aromatase inhibitor compared with tamoxifen users appeared to be driven by protective effects of tamoxifen, rather than toxic effects of aromatase inhibitors. We also confirmed the known increased risk of venous thromboembolic events in tamoxifen users.","Matthews, A.; Peacock Hinton, S.; Stanway, S.; Lyon, A. R.; Smeeth, L.; Lund, J.

Participants: IeDEA is organized in four regions (Central, East, Southern and West Africa), with 240 treatment and care sites, six data centres at African, European and US universities, and almost 1.4 million children, adolescents and adult people living with HIV (PLWHIV) enrolled. Findings to date: The data include socio-demographic characteristics, clinical outcomes, opportunistic events, treatment regimens, clinic visits and laboratory measurements. They have been used to analyse outcomes in people living with HIV-1 or HIV-2 who initiate ART, including determinants of mortality, of switching to second-line and third-line ART, drug resistance, loss to follow-up and the immunological and virological response to different ART regimens. Programme-level estimates of mortality have been corrected for loss to follow-up. We examined the impact of co-infection with hepatitis B and C, and the epidemiology of different cancers and of (multi-drug resistant) tuberculosis, renal disease and of mental illness. The adoption of 'Treat All', making ART available to all PLWHIV regardless of CD4+ cell count or clinical stage was another important research topic. Future plans: IeDEA has formulated several research priorities for the 'Treat All' era in sub-Saharan Africa.

591,"Co-circulation and misdiagnosis led to underestimation of the 2015-2017 Zika epidemic in the Americas","During the 2015-2017 Zika epidemic, dengue and chikungunya -- two other viral diseases with the same vector as Zika -- were also in circulation. Clinical presentation of these diseases can vary from person to person in terms of symptoms and severity, making it difficult to differentially diagnose them. Under these circumstances, it is possible that numerous cases of Zika could have been misdiagnosed as dengue or chikungunya, or vice versa. Given the importance of surveillance data for informing epidemiological analyses, our aim was to quantify the potential extent of misdiagnosis during this epidemic. Using basic principles of probability and empirical estimates of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, we generated revised estimates of Zika incidence that accounted for the accuracy of diagnoses made on the basis of clinical presentation with or without molecular confirmation. Applying this method to weekly incidence data from 43 countries throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, we estimated that 1,062,821 (95% CrI: 1,014,428-1,104,794) Zika cases occurred during this epidemic, which is 56.4% (95% CrI: 49.3-62.6%) more than the 679,743 cases diagnosed as Zika. Our results imply that misdiagnosis was more common in countries with proportionally higher incidence of dengue and chikungunya, such as Brazil.","Oidtman, R.

607,"The Pan-Cancer Landscape of Prognostic Germline Variants in 10,582 Patients","While clinical data provides physicians with information about patient prognosis, genomic data can further improve these predictions. We analyzed sequencing data from over 10,000 cancer patients and identified hundreds of prognostic germline variants using multivariate Cox regression models. These variants provide information about patient outcomes beyond clinical information currently in use and may augment clinical decisions based on expected tumor aggressiveness. Molecularly, at least twelve of the germline variants are likely associated with patient outcome through perturbation of protein structure and at least five through association with gene expression differences. About half of these germline variants are in previously reported tumor suppressors or oncogenes, with the other half pointing to loci of previously unstudied genes in the literature that should be further investigated for roles in cancers. Our results suggest that germline variation contributes to tumor progression across most cancers and contains patient outcome information not captured by clinical factors.","Chatrath, A.; Przanowska, R.; Kiran, S.; Su, Z.; Saha, S.; Wilson, B.; Tsunematsu, T.; Ahn, J.-H.; Lee, K.

611,"DNA methylation biomarker in blood predicts frailty in an HIV-positive veteran population","Background: With the improved life expectancy in people living with HIV, predicting individual frailty is important for clinical care. DNA methylation (DNAm) has emerged as a robust biomarker in precision medicine and has been previously linked to aging and mortality in non-HIV populations. Here, we aim to establish a panel of DNAm features selected from blood methylome to predict frailty in HIV-positive men from a veteran population, Veterans Aging Cohort Study (VACS). Methods: We used a well-established score, VACS Index, as a measure of frailty. Samples (ntotal=1,150) were divided into a training set (n=612) and a validation set (n=538). We first selected a panel of frailty-associated CpGs by conducting an epigenome-wide association analysis on the VACS index in the training set. We then applied four machine learning methods to build models to predict high and low frailty individuals in the training set. The prediction models were tested in the validation set. A methylation score constructed from the selected CpGs was tested an associated with mortality by performing survival analysis. To assess the biological relevance of the selected CpG sites, we performed a gene ontology enrichment analysis. Results: A panel of 119 CpGs were identified from the training set (False Discovery Rate <0.2) that showed excellent performance on predicting high frailty individuals with Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.835 (95%CI: 0.792, 0.879) and balanced accuracy of 0.693. The same panel showed good performance on predicting low frailty individuals with AUC of 0.735 (95%CI: 0.688-0.782) and a balanced accuracy of 0.528. The methylation score from the 119 CpGs was significantly associated with 5-year and 10-year mortality with hazard ratio of 1.40 (95% CI:1.033, 1.897 p=0.03) and 1.48 (95%CI: 1.10, 2.02; p=0.01) respectively. These 119 CpGs were located within or near 73 genes that were significantly enriched in 9 biological pathways relevant to immune and inflammation response. Conclusions: We identified a panel of predictive DNAm features associated with frailty and mortality among HIV-positive population. These DNAm features may serve as biomarkers to discriminate high and low frailty people who live with HIV.","Shu, C.; Justice, A. C.; Zhang, X.; Marconi, V. C.; Hancock, D. B.; Johnson, E.

589,"Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism is not risk factor for bipolar disorder","Bipolar disorder (BPD) is a psychiatric disease, characterized by the cycles of mania and depression. Several genetic studies investigated BDNF gene Val66Met polymorphism as risk factor for BPD, but results were inconclusive. Therefore, present meta-analysis was performed to reevaluate the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and BPD association. Four databases (Pubmed, Springer Link, Science Direct and Google Scholar) were searched for eligible studies up to March 31,2018. Pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to estimate the strength of the association. All statistical analyses were done by MetaAnalyst and Mix program. Forty studies with a total of 28,787 subjects (10,085 cases and 18,702 controls) were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, pooled analysis indicated that there was no significant association between BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and BPD risk under all five genetic models (ORA vs.G =0.99, 95%CI= 0.94-1.03, p=0.49; ORAG vs. GG= 0.1.02, 95%CI= 0.95-1.07, p= 0.57; ORAA vs. GG = 0.98, 95%CI=0.89-1.08, p=0.75; ORAA+AG vs. GG= 1.0, 95%CI= 0.94-1.06, p= 0.89;ORAA vs. AG+GG= 0.96, 95%CI= 0.89-1.05, p= 0.47). Similarly, no significant association was observed in ethnicity based subgroup analysis in both Asian and Caucasian population. However, significant association was found in subtype analysis between BDNF Val66Met and BPDII (ORAA+AG vs. GG= 1.21, 95%CI= 1.06-1.37, p= 0.003) but not with BPDI. These findings suggested that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism confer no genetic susceptibility to BPD I but risk for BPDII.","Rai, V.; Jamal, F.; Kumar, P.",20191025,"Genetic And Genomic Medicine","10.1101/19010280",1,"Vandana Rai","Veer Bahadur Singh Purvanchal university, Jaunpur, UP","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19010280v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19010280v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nd",NA,"All data are reported in the paper."
649,"Maternal MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and risk of congenital heart disease in fetus","Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is an important enzyme involved in folate metabolism, DNA synthesis and methylation. A number of studies have examined the association of maternal MTHFR A1298C polymorphism with congenital heart disease (CHD) susceptibility; however, the conclusions were contradictory. To clarify the influence of maternal MTHFR A1298C polymorphism on CHD, a meta-analysis of seventeen case-control studies was carried out. Four electronic databases - Pubmed, Google Scholars, Elsevier and Springer Link were searched upto June, 2018 for suitable articles. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to evaluate the association. Meta-analysis was performed by Mix and MetaAnalyst programs. The results of meta-analysis suggested that except co-dominant model, maternal A1298C polymorphism is risk for CHD in fetus using overall comparisons in four genetic models (C vs. A: OR= 1.19, 95% CI= 1.00-1.41, p= 0.04; CC+AC vs. AA: OR= 1.19, 95% CI= 0.97-1.4, p= 0.04; CC vs. AA: OR= 1.46, 95% CI= 1.00-2.13, p= 0.04; AC vs. AA OR= 1.13, 95% CI=0.93-1.36, p= 0.23; CC vs. AC+AA: OR=1.34, 95% CI=1.1-1.6, p=0.01).

650,"Long-term retention on antiretroviral therapy among infants, children, adolescents and adults in Malawi: A cohort study","Objectives: We examine long-term retention of adults, adolescents and children on antiretroviral therapy under different HIV treatment guidelines in Malawi. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting and participants: Adults and children starting ART between 2005 and 2015 in 21 health facilities in southern Malawi. Methods: We used survival analysis to assess retention at clinic level, Cox regression to examine risk factors for loss to follow up, and competing risk analysis to assess long-term outcomes of people on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Results: We included 132,274 individuals in our analysis, totalling 270,256 person years of follow up (PYFU; median per patient 1.3, interquartile range (IQR) 0.26-3.1), 62% were female and the median age was 32 years. Retention on ART was lower in the first year on ART compared to subsequent years for all guideline periods and age groups. Infants (0-3 years), adolescents and young adults (15-24 years) were at highest risk of LTFU. Comparing the different calendar periods of ART initiation we found that retention improved initially, but remained stable thereafter. Conclusion: Even though the number of patients and the burden on health care system increased substantially during the study period of rapid ART expansion, retention on ART improved in the early years of ART provision, but gains in retention were not maintained over 5 years on ART. Reducing high attrition in the first year of ART should remain a priority for ART programs, and so should addressing poor retention among adolescents, young adults and men.","Mugglin, C.; Haas, A.; Van Oosterhout, J.; Msukwa, M.; Tenthani, L.; Estill, J.; Egger, M.; Keiser, O.",20191102,"Epidemiology","10.1101/19010322",1,"Catrina Mugglin","University of Bern","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19010322v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19010322v1.full.pdf","cc_no","10.1371/journal.pone.0224837","The data are available from the corresponding author on request, conditional on approval by the Malawi Ministry of Health."

702,"Tensor Fasciae Suralis: Prevalence Study and Literature Review","Tensor fasciae suralis (TFS) is an accessory muscle of the posterior lower extremity. Although TFS has been documented in cadaveric and radiological reports, its prevalence remains unknown. The TFS variant is noteworthy to anatomists, as it may be encountered in the dissection laboratory, and clinicians, as the muscle could potentially cause confusion during physical examination or diagnostic imaging. Multiple variations of TFS have been reported in the literature, suggesting the need for a classification system. We dissected 236 formalin-fixed cadaveric lower limbs to determine the prevalence of TFS. The PubMed and MEDLINE databases were searched to compare the anatomical features of independent TFS case reports. In our prevalence study, the TFS muscle was identified in three lower limbs (1.3%). In total, 35 cases of TFS (31 cadaveric and four radiological) were identified in the literature. Our literature review revealed that the accessory muscle most often arises as a single head from the long head of the biceps femoris, yet many other presentations have been documented. The need for a classification system to distinguish between the subtypes of TFS became apparent during the literature review. Tensor fasciae suralis is a rare muscle, present in only 3 of 236 (1.3%) cadaveric lower limbs dissected in this study. We propose the use of a classification system, based on muscle origin and number of heads, to better organize the subtypes of TFS.","Bale, L.; Herrin, S.",20191108,"Sports Medicine","10.1101/19010389",1,"Logan Bale","Queen\'s University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19010389v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19010389v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"All data used for the manuscript is included in the manuscript."
622,"From frail to fit after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation: Scope of the problem and a strength-based solution","Background: Frailty is a common but underdiagnosed syndrome among long-term survivors of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Conditions such as malnutrition, fatigue, and weakness may suggest frailty despite patients not receiving a formal diagnosis. Furthermore, the optimal interventions to overcome frailty in long-term survivors of allogeneic HCT is not yet established. Patients and Methods: This study consists of a retrospective and prospective component. First, we completed a retrospective review using diagnosis data from the electronic medical record to estimate the prevalence of components of frailty in 1077 recipients of allogeneic HCT through 5 years post-transplant. Second, we developed a community-based pilot study of strength training for long-term survivors of allogeneic HCT that addressed several common barriers exercise engagement and adherence. Four allogeneic HCT recipients (2 males, 2 females) and 4 controls (2 males, 2 females) completed the strength training pilot study, consisting of a baseline assessment, 10 weeks of personalized and supervised strength programming at least once weekly as a group, and an end-of-study assessment to measure progress in strength, body composition, and a standardized measure of self-efficacy. Results: Despite a lack of a formal diagnosis, approximately 80% of HCT recipients in this series received a diagnosis of a component of frailty (weakness, fatigue, or malnutrition), and over 1/3 of HCT recipients had symptoms extending beyond 1 year. Over the course of the strength training pilot study, both pre-frail/frail allogeneic HCT recipients and healthy controls doubled their total strength, lost body fat, and gained muscle mass. Self-efficacy improved from baseline in allogeneic HCT recipients after the strength training pilot program. Discussion: Based upon the prevalence of frailty-related diagnoses among long-term survivors of HCT, a comprehensive mitigation strategy needs to be developed for this population. A community-based strength training program that includes a personalized component, a group setting, and caregiver/partner involvement appears feasible and overcomes several established barriers to exercise engagement and adherence.","Sweetnam, J.; Twohey, E.; Skendzel, S.; Stingle, J.; Arora, M.; Baraki, A.; Cao, Q.; Grillo, S.; Holtan, S.

618,"Prediction of Suicidal Ideation in the Canadian Community Health Survey - Mental Health Component Using Deep Learning","Introduction: Suicidal ideation (SI) is prevalent in the general population, and is a prominent risk factor for suicide. However, predicting which patients are likely to have SI remains a challenge. Deep Learning (DL) may be a useful tool in this context, as it can be used to find patterns in complex, heterogeneous, and incomplete psychiatric datasets. An automated screening system for SI could help prompt clinicians to be more attentive to patients at risk for suicide. Methods: Using the Canadian Community Health Survey - Mental Health Component, we trained a DL model based on 23,859 survey responses to predict lifetime SI on an individual patient basis. Models were created to predict both lifetime and last 12 month SI. We reduced 582 possible model parameters captured by the survey to 96 and 21 feature versions of the models. Models were trained using an undersampling procedure that balanced the training set between SI and non-SI respondents; validation was done on held-out data. Results: AUC was used as the main model metric. For lifetime SI, the 96 feature model had an AUC of 0.79 and the 21 feature model had an AUC of 0.75. For SI in the last 12 months the 96 feature model had an AUC of 0.76 and the 21 feature model had an AUC of 0.69. DL outperformed random forest classifiers. Discussion: Although requiring further study to ensure clinical relevance and sample generalizability, this study is a proof-of-concept for the use of DL to improve prediction of SI. This kind of model would help start conversations with patients which could lead to improved care and, it is hoped, a reduction in suicidal behavior.","Desai, S.; Tanguay-Sela, M.; Benrimoh, D.; Fratila, R.; Brown, E.; Perlman, K.; John, A.; Delpozo-Banos, M.; Low, N.; Israel, S.; Palladini, L.; Turecki, G.",20191029,"Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology","10.1101/19010413",1,"David Benrimoh","McGill University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19010413v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19010413v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"Data available from Statistics Canada"
620,"Lower limb muscle activity underlying temporal gait asymmetry post-stroke","Objective: Asymmetric walking after stroke is common, detrimental, and difficult to treat, but current knowledge of underlying physiological mechanisms is limited. This study investigated electromyographic (EMG) features of temporal gait asymmetry (TGA). Methods: Participants post-stroke with or without TGA and control adults (n=27, 8, and 9, respectively) performed self-paced overground gait trials. EMG, force plate, and motion capture data were collected. Lower limb muscle activity was compared across groups and sides (more/less affected). Correlation between burst timing variables and asymmetry ratios was examined. Results: Significant group by side interaction effects were found: fewer TGA group dorsiflexor bursts during swing (p=.0009), more affected plantarflexor stance activity ended early (p=.0006) and less affected dorsiflexor on/off time was delayed (p<.01) in persons with asymmetry compared to symmetric and normative controls. Less affected side EMG timing correlated most with swing time ratio (r=0.68-0.90, p<.001). Conclusions: Temporal patterns of muscular activation, particularly about the ankle around the stance-to-swing transition period, are associated with TGA. The results may reflect specific impairments or compensations that affect locomotor coordination. Significance: Neuromuscular underpinnings of spatiotemporal asymmetry have not been previously characterized. These novel findings may inform targeted therapeutic strategies to improve gait quality after stroke.","Rozanski, G. M.; Huntley, A. H.; Crosby, L. D.; Schinkel-Ivy, A.; Mansfield, A.; Patterson, K.

613,"Establishing Cutoffs for Streptococcal Antibody Titers in Uganda: Implications for Rheumatic Fever Diagnosis","Background Central to rheumatic fever (RF) diagnosis is evidence of streptococcal exposure, specifically antistreptolysin O (ASO) and antideoxyribonuclease B (ADB) antibodies. It is unknown if these antibody titers should be adjusted to the background exposure rates of GAS or if published standards should be used. Here, we establish the normal values of ASO and ADB in Uganda and examine RF case detection using published vs. population-specific thresholds. Methods Participants (age 0-50 years) were recruited. ASO was measured in-country by nephelometric technique. ADB samples were sent to Australia (PathWest) for ADB determination by enzyme inhibition assay, andthe 80% upper limit values by age were established. The published standard values for ASO (200IU/ml) and ADB (375IU/ml) were compared to the Ugandan 80% upper limit of normal values (ULN) for RF case detection in children 5-15 years. Findings Of the 428 participants, 16 were excluded from analysis (9 sore throat, 1 skin sores, 5 fever, 4 echocardiograms showing occult RHD), and 183 of the remaining were children 5-15 years. The median ASO titer in this age group was 220 IU/ml, with the 80th percentile value of 389 IU/ml. The median ADB titer in this age group was 375 IU/ml, with the 80th percentile value of 568 IU/ml. Application of new Ugandan cutoffs to 528 children enrolled in our prospective RF study, reduced the number of definite RF cases to 120/528 (22-7%), as compared to 173/528 (32-8%) using published normal values. Interpretation The 80th percentile ULN for ASO and ADB are higher in Uganda than in other countries. Applying these higher values to RF diagnosis in Uganda results in higher diagnostic specificity, but some unknown loss in sensitivity. Implications of over-diagnosis and missed cases will be explored through a longitudinal follow-up study of children in the RF research program.

976,"Identifying Acute Low Back Pain Episodes in Primary Care Practice from Clinical Notes","Acute and chronic low back pain (LBP) are different conditions with different treatments. However, they are coded in electronic health records with the same ICD-10 code (M54.5) and can be differentiated only by retrospective chart reviews. This prevents efficient definition of data driven guidelines for billing and therapy recommendations, such as return to-work options. To solve this issue, we evaluate the feasibility of automatically distinguishing acute LBP episodes by analyzing free text clinical notes. We used a dataset of 17,409 clinical notes from different primary care practices; of these, 891 documents were manually annotated as ""acute LBP"" and 2,973 were generally associated with LBP via the recorded ICD-10 code. We compared different supervised and unsupervised strategies for automated identification: keyword search; topic modeling; logistic regression with bag-of-n-grams and manual features; and deep learning (ConvNet). We trained the supervised models using either manual annotations or ICD-10 codes as positive labels. ConvNet trained using manual annotations obtained the best results with an AUC-ROC of 0.97 and F-score of 0.72. ConvNet's results were also robust to reduction of the number of manually annotated documents. In the absence of manual annotations, topic models performed better than methods trained using ICD-10 codes, which were unsatisfactory for identifying LBP acuity. This study uses clinical notes to delineate a potential path toward systematic learning of therapeutic strategies, billing guidelines, and management options for acute LBP at the point of care.","Miotto, R.; Percha, B.

639,"Real-time Estimation of Disease Activity in Emerging Outbreaks using Internet Search Information","Understanding the behavior of emerging disease outbreaks in, or ahead of, real-time could help healthcare officials better design interventions to mitigate impacts on affected populations. Most healthcare-based disease surveillance systems, however, have significant inherent reporting delays due to data collection, aggregation, and distribution processes. Recent work has shown that machine learning methods leveraging a combination of traditionally collected epidemiological information and novel Internet-based data sources, such as disease-related Internet search activity, can produce meaningful ""nowcasts"" of disease incidence ahead of healthcare-based estimates, with most successful case studies focusing on endemic and seasonal diseases such as influenza and dengue. Here, we apply similar computational methods to emerging outbreaks in geographic regions where no historical presence of the disease of interest has been observed. By combining limited available historical epidemiological data available with disease-related Internet search activity, we retrospectively estimate disease activity in five recent outbreaks weeks ahead of traditional surveillance methods. We find that the proposed computational methods frequently provide useful real-time incidence estimates that can help fill temporal data gaps resulting from surveillance reporting delays. How- ever, the proposed methods are limited by issues of sample bias and skew in search query volumes, perhaps as a result of media coverage.","Aiken, E. L.; Mcgough, S. F.; Majumder, M.

711,"Replicating Global Brain Connectivity as an Imaging Marker for Depression - Influence of Preprocessing Strategies and Randomized Placebo-Controlled Ketamine Treatment","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with altered global brain connectivity (GBC), as assessed via resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). Previous studies found that antidepressant treatment with ketamine normalized aberrant GBC changes in the prefrontal and cingulate cortices, warranting further investigations of GBC as a putative imaging marker. However, the results were only obtained via global signal regression (GSR). This study is an independent replication of that analysis using a separate dataset. GBC was analyzed in 28 individuals with MDD and 22 healthy controls (HCs) at baseline, post-placebo, and post-ketamine. To investigate the effects of preprocessing, three distinct pipelines were used: 1) regression of white matter (WM)/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signals only (BASE); 2) WM/CSF+GSR (GSR); and 3) WM/CSF+physiological parameter regression (PHYSIO). Compared to PHYSIO and BASE regression, GSR reduced Fisher Z-scores (Fz-scores) in large clusters. PHYSIO did not resemble GBC preprocessed with GSR (GBCr). Reduced GBCr was observed in individuals with MDD at baseline in the anterior and medial cingulate cortices, as well as in the prefrontal cortex. Significant results were only found with GSR. Ketamine had no effect compared to baseline or placebo in either group. These results concur with several studies that used GSR to study GBC. Altered GBCr was observed in the cingulate and prefrontal cortices, but ketamine treatment had no effect. Further investigations are warranted into disease-specific components of global fMRI signals that may drive these results and of GBCr as a potential imaging marker in MDD.","Kraus, C.; Mkrtchian, A.; Kadriu, B.; Nugent, A.

688,"Altered subcortical emotional salience processing differentiates Parkinson's patients with and without psychotic symptoms","Background: Current research does not provide a clear explanation for why some patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) develop psychotic symptoms. In the field of schizophrenia research the 'aberrant salience hypothesis' of psychosis has been influential. According to the theory, dopaminergic dysregulation leads to the inappropriate attribution of salience to otherwise irrelevant or non-informative stimuli, allowing for the formation of hallucinations and delusions. This theory has not yet been extensively investigated in the context of psychosis in PD. Methods: We investigated salience processing in 14 PD patients with a history of psychotic symptoms, 23 PD patients without psychotic symptoms and 19 healthy controls. All patients received dopaminergic medication. We examined emotional salience using a visual oddball fMRI paradigm (Bunzeck and Duezel, 2006) that previously has been used to investigate early stages of schizophrenia spectrum psychosis, controlling for resting cerebral blood flow as assessed with arterial spin labelling fMRI. Results: We found significant differences between patient groups in brain responses to emotional salience. PD patients with psychotic symptoms revealed senhanced brain responses in the striatum, the hippocampus and the amygdala compared to PD patients without psychotic symptoms. PD patients with psychotic symptoms also showed significant correlations between the levels of dopaminergic drugs they were taking and BOLD signalling, as well as psychotic symptom scores. Furthermore, our data provide a first indication for dysfunctional top-down processes, measured in a 'jumping to conclusions' bias. Conclusion: Our study suggests that enhanced signalling in the striatum, hippocampus and amygdala together with deficient top-down cognitive regulations is associated with the development of psychotic symptoms in PD which is similar to that proposed in the 'aberrant salience hypothesis' of psychosis in schizophrenia.","Knolle, F.; Garofalo, S.; Viviani, R.; Justicia, A.; Ermakova, A.

653,"Optimal Pharmacological Management and Prevention of Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis (GIOP): Protocol for a Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis","Introduction Glucocorticoid (GC) administration is an effective therapy commonly used in the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. However, the use of GC can give rise to serious complications. The main detrimental side effect of GC therapy is significant bone loss, resulting in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP). There are a variety of treatments available for preventing and managing GIOP; however, without clearly defined guidelines, it can be very difficult for physicians to choose the optimal therapy for their patients. Previous network meta-analyses (NMAs) and meta-analyses did not include all available RCT trials, or only performed pairwise comparisons. We present a protocol for a NMA that incorporates all available RCT patient data to provide the most comprehensive ranking of all available GIOP treatments in terms of their ability to increase bone mineral density (BMD) and decrease fracture incidences among adult patients undergoing GC treatments. Methods and Analysis We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, CENTRAL and Chinese literature sources (CNKI, CQVIP, Wanfang Data, Wanfang Med Online) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which fit our criteria. RCTs that evaluate different antiresorptive regimens taken by adult patients undergoing GC therapy during the study or had taken GC for at least 3 months in the year prior to study commencement with lumbar spine BMD, femoral neck BMD, total hip BMD, vertebral fracture incidences and/or non-vertebral fracture incidences as outcomes will be selected. We will perform title/abstract and full-text screening as well as data extraction in duplicate. Risk of bias (ROB) will be evaluated in duplicate for each study, and the quality of evidence will be examined using CINeMA in accordance to the GRADE framework. We will use R and gemtc to perform the NMA. We will report BMD results as weighted mean differences (WMDs) and standardized mean differences (SMDs), and we will report fracture incidences as odds ratios. We will use the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) scores to provide numerical estimations of the rankings of interventions. Ethics and Dissemination The study will not require ethical approval. The findings of the NMA will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at conferences. We aim to produce the most comprehensive quantitative analysis regarding the management of GIOP. Our analysis should be able to provide physicians and patients with an up-to-date recommendation for pharmacotherapies in reducing incidences of bone loss and fractures associated with GIOP.

641,"Association Between Tuberculosis and Depression on Negative Outcomes of Tuberculosis Treatment: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis","Background: Depression is a common comorbidity of tuberculosis (TB) and is associated with poor adherence to treatment of multiple disorders. We conducted a systematic review to synthesize the existing evidence on the relationship between depression and negative outcomes of TB treatment. Methods: We systematically reviewed studies that evaluated depressive symptoms (DS) directly or indirectly through psychological distress (PD) and measured negative treatment outcomes of drug-sensitive pulmonary TB, defined as death, loss to follow-up, or non-adherence. Sources included PubMed, Global Health Library, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science from inception to August 2019. Results: Of the 2,970 studies initially identified, eight articles were eligible for inclusion and two were used for the primary outcome meta-analysis. We found a strong association between DS and negative TB treatment outcomes (OR=4.26; CI95%:2.33-7.79; I2=0%). DS were also associated with loss to follow-up (OR=8.70; CI95%:6.50-11.64; I2=0%) and death (OR=2.85; CI95%:1.52-5.36; I2=0%). Non-adherence was not associated with DS and PD (OR=1.34; CI95%:0.70-2.72; I2=94.36) or PD alone (OR=0.92; CI95%:0.81-1.05; I2=0%). Conclusions: DS are associated with the negative TB treatment outcomes of death and loss to follow-up. Considerable heterogeneity exists in the definition of depression and outcomes such as non-adherence across the limited number of studies on this topic.","Ruiz-Grosso, P.; Cachay, R.; De La Flor, A.; Schwalb, A.; Ugarte-Gil, C.",20191102,"Infectious Diseases","10.1101/19010538",1,"Cesar Ugarte-Gil","Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19010538v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19010538v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd","10.1371/journal.pone.0227472","The authors had full access to the study<U+0092>s data and were responsible for the decision to submit for publication.

637,"Predicting Current Juul use among Emerging Adults through Twitter Feeds","Introduction: Can we predict whether someone uses Juul based on their social media activities? This is the central premise of the effort reported in this paper. Several recent social media-related studies on Juul use tend to focus on the characterization of Juul-related messages on social media. In this study, we assess the potential in using machine learning methods to automatically identify whether an individual uses Juul (past 30-day usage) based on their Twitter data. Methods: We obtained a collection of 588 instances, for training and testing, of Juul use patterns (along with associated Twitter handles) via survey responses of college students. With this data, we built and tested supervised machine learning models based on linear and deep learning algorithms with textual, social network (friends and followers), and hand-crafted features. Results: The linear model with textual and follower network features performed best with a precision-recall trade-off such that precision (PPV) is 57% at 24% recall (sensitivity). Hence, at least every other user flagged by our model is expected to be a Juul user. Additionally, our results indicate that social network features tend to have a large impact (positive) on predictive performance. Conclusion: There are enough predictive signals from social feeds for supervised modeling of Juul use, even with limited training data, implying that such models are highly beneficial to very focused intervention campaigns. Moreover, this initial success indicates potential for more involved automated surveillance of Juul use based on social media data, including Juul usage patterns, nicotine dependency, and risk awareness.","Tran, T.; Ickes, M.; Hester, J.

647,"Egocentric Sexual Networks of Men Who Have Sex with Men in the United States: Results from the ARTnet Study","In this paper, we present an overview and descriptive results from the first egocentric network study of MSM from across the United States (U.S.): the ARTnet study. ARTnet was designed to support prevention research for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that are transmitted across partnership networks. ARTnet implemented a population-based egocentric network study design that sampled egos from the target population and asked them to report on the number, attributes, and timing of their sexual partnerships. Such data provide the foundation needed for estimating and simulating stochastic network models that are used for disease projection and intervention planning. ARTnet collected data online from 2017 to 2019, with a final sample of 4904 participants who reported on 16198 sexual partnerships. The analytic aims of the study were to characterize the joint distribution of three network parameters needed for modeling: degree distributions, assortative mixing, and partnership length, with heterogeneity by partnership type (main, casual and one-time), demography, and geography. Participants had an average of 1.19 currently active partnerships (""mean degree""), which was higher for casual partnerships (0.74) than main partnerships (0.45). The mean rate of one-time partnership acquisition was 0.16 per week (8.5 partners per year). Main partnerships lasted 272.5 weeks on average, while casual partnerships lasted 133.0 weeks. There was strong but heterogenous assortative mixing by race/ethnicity for all groups. The mean absolute age difference was 9.5 years, with main partners differing by 6.3 years compared to 10.8 years for casual partners. Our analysis suggests that MSM may be at sustained risk for HIV/STI acquisition and transmission through high network degree of sexual partnerships. The ARTnet network study provides a robust and reproducible foundation for understanding the dynamics of HIV/STI epidemiology among U.S. MSM and supporting the implementation science that seeks to address persistent challenges in HIV/STI prevention.","Weiss, K.

640,"Our culture prohibits some things: Qualitative inquiry into how sociocultural context influences the scale up of community-based injectable contraceptives in Nigeria","Objectives: To explore how sociocultural factors may support or impede the adoption of community-based distribution of injectable contraceptives in Nigeria. Design: A qualitative study based on a grounded theory approach was conducted through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Setting: Most participants lived in Gombe State, North East Nigeria. Other participants were from Ibadan (South West) and Abuja (Federal capital territory). Participants: Through seven key informant interviews, 15 in-depth interviews and 10 focus group discussions, 102 participants were involved in the study. Methods: This study, conducted in 2016 was part of a larger study on scale up of community-based distribution of injectable contraceptives. Qualitative data were collected from traditional and religious leaders, health workers and community members. The data were audio recorded, transcribed and analysed using a thematic framework method. Results: Sociocultural challenges to scale up included patriarchy and men fear of losing control over their spouses, traditional and religious beliefs about fertility, and myths about contraceptives and family planning. As a result of deep-rooted beliefs that children are divine blessings and that procreation should not be regulated, participants described a subtle resistance to uptake of injectable contraceptives. Since Gombe is largely a patriarchal society, male involvement emerged as important to the success of meaningful innovation uptake. Community leaders largely described their participation in the scale up process as active, although they also identified scope for further involvement and recognition. Conclusion: Scale up is more than setting up health sector implementing structures, training health workers and getting innovation supplies, but also requires preparedness which includes paying attention to complex contextual issues. This requires the health system and those who work in it, to move beyond a narrow health comfort zone by actively engaging with, and learning from, those who are leading, caring for and living in, the community.","Akinyemi, O.

633,"Seven Decades of Chemotherapy Clinical Trials: A Pan-Cancer Social Network Analysis","Background: Clinical trials establish the standard of care for cancer and other diseases. While social network analysis has been applied to basic sciences, the social component of clinical trial research is not well characterized. We examined the social network of cancer clinical trialists and its dynamic development over more than 70 years, including the roles of subspecialization and gender in relation to traditional and network-based metrics of productivity. Methods: We conducted a social network analysis of authors publishing chemotherapy-based prospective trials from 1946-2018, based on the curated knowledge base HemOnc.org, examining: 1) network density; 2) modularity; 3) assortativity; 4) betweenness centrality; 5) PageRank; and 6) the proportion of co-authors sharing the same primary cancer subspecialty designation. Individual author impact and productive period were analyzed as a function of gender and subspecialty. Findings: From 1946-2018, the network grew to 29,197 authors and 697,084 co-authors. While 99.4% of authors were directly or indirectly connected as of 2018, the network had very few connections and was very siloed by cancer subspecialty. Small numbers of individuals were highly connected and had disproportionate impact (scale-free effects). Women were under-represented and likelier to have lower impact, shorter productive periods (P<0.001 for both comparisons), less centrality, and a greater proportion of co-authors in their same subspecialty. The past 30 years were characterized by a trend towards increased authorship by women, with new author parity anticipated in 2032. However, women remain a distinct minority of first/last authors, with parity not anticipated for 50+ years. Interpretation: The network of cancer clinical trialists is best characterized as a strategic or ""mixed-motive"" network, with cooperative and competitive elements influencing its appearance. Network effects e.g., low centrality, which may limit access to high-profile individuals, likely contribute to ongoing disparities.

698,"Successful suppression of a field population of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes using a novel biological vector control strategy is associated with significantly lower incidence of dengue","Background. Despite extensive efforts to prevent recurrent Aedes-borne arbovirus epidemics, there is a steady rise in their global incidence. Vaccines/treatments show very limited efficacy and together with the emergence of mosquito resistance to insecticides, it has become urgent to develop alternative solutions for efficient, sustainable and environmentally benign mosquito vector control. Here we present a new Sterile Insect Technology (SIT)-based program that uses large-scale releases of sterile male mosquitoes produced by a highly effective, safe and environmentally benign method. Methods and findings. To test the efficacy of this approach, a field trial was conducted in a Brazilian city (Jacarezinho), which presented a history of 3 epidemics of dengue in the past decade. Sterile male mosquitoes were produced from a locally acquired Aedes aegypti colony, and releases were carried out on a weekly basis for seven months in a predefined area. This treated area was matched to a control area, in terms of size, layout, historic mosquito infestation index, socioeconomic patterns and comparable prevalence of dengue cases in past outbreaks. Releases of sterile male mosquitoes resulted in up to 91.4% reduction of live progeny of field Ae. aegypti mosquitoes recorded over time. The reduction in the mosquito population was corroborated by the standard monitoring system (LIRAa index) as determined by the local municipality, which found that our treated neighborhoods were almost free of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes after 5 months of release, whereas neighborhoods adjacent to the treated area and the control neighborhoods were highly infested. Importantly, when a dengue outbreak started in Jacarezinho in March 2019, the effective mosquito population suppression was shown to be associated with a far lower incidence of dengue in the treated area (16 cases corresponding to 264 cases per 100,000 inhabitants) almost 16 times lower than the dengue incidence in the control area (198 cases corresponding to 4,360 dengue cases per 100,000 inhabitants). Conclusions. Our data present the first demonstration that a SIT-based intervention has the potential to prevent the spread of dengue, opening exciting new opportunities for preventing mosquito-borne disease.","Poncio, L.

657,"PET markers of tau and neuroinflammation are co-localized in progressive supranuclear palsy","Background: Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) is associated with tau-protein aggregation and neuroinflammation, but it remains unclear whether these pathogenic processes are related in vivo. Objectives: We examined the relationship between tau pathology and microglial activation using [18F]AV-1451 (indexing tau burden) and [11C]PK11195 (microglial activation) PET in n=17 patients with PSP-Richardson's syndrome. Methods: Non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) for each ligand was quantified in 83 regions of interest (ROIs). [18F]AV-1451 and [11C]PK11195 BPND values were correlated across all ROIs. The anatomical patterns of [18F]AV-1451 and [11C]PK11195 binding co-localization was determined across sets of regions derived from principal component analyses (PCAs). Finally, PCA-derived brain patterns of tau pathology and neuroinflammation were linked to clinical severity. Results: [18F]AV-1451 and [11C]PK11195 binding were positively related across all ROIs (r=0.577, p<0.0001). PCAs identified four components for each ligand, reflecting the relative expression of tau pathology or neuroinflammation in distinct groups of brain regions. Positive associations between [18F]AV-1451 and [11C]PK11195 components were found in sub-cortical (r=0.769, p<0.0001) and cortical components (r=0.836, p<0.0001). PCA-derived components reflecting tau burden (r=0.599, p=0.011) and neuroinflammation (r=0.713, p=0.001) in sub-cortical areas related to disease severity. Conclusions: We show that tau pathology and neuroinflammation co-localize in PSP, and that individual differences in subcortical tau pathology and neuroinflammation are linked to clinical severity. Although longitudinal studies are needed to determine how these molecular pathologies are causally linked, we suggest that the combination of tau- and immune-oriented strategies may be useful for effective disease-modifying treatments in PSP.","Malpetti, M.; Passamonti, L.; Rittman, T.; Jones, P.

645,"Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances and bone mineral density: results from the Bayesian weighted quantile sum regression","Background: Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are chemicals, detected in 95% of Americans, that induce osteotoxicity and modulate hormones thereby influencing bone health. Previous studies found associations between individual PFAS and bone mineral density but did not analyze their combined effects. Objective: To extend weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression to a Bayesian framework (BWQS) and determine the association between a mixture of serum PFAS and mineral density in lumbar spine, total and neck femur in 499 adults from the 2013-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Methods: We used BWQS to assess the combined association of nine PFAS, as a mixture, with bone mineral density in adults. As secondary analyses, we focused on vulnerable populations (men over 50 years and postmenopausal women). Analyses were weighted according to NHANES weights and were adjusted for socio-demographic factors. Sensitivity analyses included bone mineral density associations with individual compounds and results from WQS regressions. Results: The mean age was 55 years old (Standard Error [SE]=1) with average spine, total and neck femur mineral densities of 1.01 (SE=0.01), 0.95 (SE=0.01), and 0.78 (SE=0.01) gm/cm2, respectively. PFAS mixture levels showed no evidence of association with mineral density (spine: Beta=-0.004; 95% credible interval [CrI]=-0.04, 0.04; total femur: Beta=0.002; 95%CrI=-0.04, 0.05; femur neck: Beta=0.005; 95%CrI=-0.03, 0.04) in the overall population. Results were also null in vulnerable populations. Findings were consistent across sensitivity analyses.

An outlier is typically defined as DNA methylation levels at any one CpG site that are three times beyond the inter-quartile range from the 25th or 75th percentiles compared to the rest of the population. DNA methylation outlier burden (the number of such outlier sites per individual) increases exponentially with age. However, these findings have been observed in small samples. Here, we showed an association between age and log10-transformed DNA methylation outlier burden in a large cross-sectional cohort, the Generation Scotland Family Health Study (N=7,010, {beta}=0.0091, p<2x10-16), and in two longitudinal cohort studies, the Lothian Birth Cohorts of 1921 (N=430, {beta}=0.033, p=7.9x10-4) and 1936 (N=898, {beta}=7.9x10-3, p=0.074). Significant confounders of both cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between outlier burden and age included white blood cell proportions, BMI, smoking, and batch effects. In Generation Scotland, the increase in epigenetic outlier burden with age was not purely an artefact of an increase in DNA methylation level variability with age (epigenetic drift). Log10-transformed DNA methylation outlier burden in Generation Scotland was not related to self-reported, or family history of, age-related diseases and it was not heritable (SNP-based heritability of 4.4%, p=0.18). Finally, DNA methylation outlier burden was not significantly related to survival in either of the Lothian Birth Cohorts individually but it was in a meta-analysis (HRmeta=1.12; 95%CImeta=[1.02; 1.21]; pmeta=0.021). These findings suggest that, while it does not associate with ageing-related health outcomes, DNA methylation outlier burden does track chronological ageing and may also relate to survival. DNA methylation outlier burden may thus be useful as a marker of biological ageing.","Seeboth, A.; Mccartney, D. L.; Wang, Y.; Hillary, R. F.; Stevenson, A. J.; Walker, R. M.; Evans, K.

662,"A phenome-wide association study of four syndromic genes reveals pleiotropic effects of common and rare variants in the general population","The clinical evaluation of a genetic syndrome relies upon recognition of a characteristic pattern of signs or symptoms to guide targeted genetic testing for confirmation of the diagnosis. However, individuals displaying a few phenotypes of a complex syndrome may not meet criteria for clinical diagnosis or genetic testing. Here, we present a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) approach to systematically explore pleiotropy of common and rare alleles in genes associated with four well-described syndromic diseases (Alagille (AS), Marfan (MS), DiGeorge (DS), and Noonan (NS) syndromes) in the general population. Using human phenotype ontology (HPO) terms, we systematically mapped 60 phenotypes related to AS, MS, DS and NS in 337,198 unrelated white British from the UK Biobank (UKBB) based on their hospital admission records, self-administrated questionnaires, and physiological measurements. We performed logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, and the first 5 genetic principal components, for each phenotype and each variant in the target genes (JAG1, TBX1, FBN1, PTPN11, NOTCH2, and MAP2K1) and performed a gene burden testing. Overall, we observed multiple phenotype-genotype correlations, such as the association between variation in JAG1, FBN1, PTPN11 and SOS2 with diastolic and systolic blood pressure; and pleiotropy among multiple variants in syndromic genes. For example, rs11066309 in PTPN11 was significantly associated with a lower body mass index, an increased risk of hypothyroidism and a smaller size for gestational age, all in concordance with NS-related phenotypes. Similarly, rs589668 in FBN1 was associated with an increase in body height and blood pressure, and a reduced body fat percentage as observed in Marfan syndrome. Our findings suggest that the spectrum of associations of common and rare variants in genes involved in syndromic diseases can be extended to individual phenotypes within the general population.","Tcheandjieu, C.; Aguirre, M.; Saha, P.; Potiny, P.; Haendel, M.; Ingelsson, E.; Rivas, M.; Priest, J.

658,"Determinants of normal haemoglobin concentration among children in Ghana: a positive deviance analysis of nationally representative cross-sectional survey data","Anaemia among children under 5, is a public health problem of serious concern. In Ghana, 8 out of every 10 children are anaemic. This study employed a novel approach to investigate the determinants of normal haemoglobin (Hb) concentration among children aged 6 to 59 months, using data from the Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys. The results showed that a year change in maternal education was positively associated with normal Hb concentration. Children of non-anaemic mothers were 1.67 (CI=1.32, 2.10; P<.001) times more likely to have normal Hb concentration relative to children of anaemic mothers. Compared to mothers who had less than 4 antenatal care (ANC) visits, mothers who had at least 4 ANC visits increased the odds of their children having a normal Hb concentration by 1.62 (CI=1.09, 2.40; P<.018). Children living in middle and rich households had respectively 1.48 (CI=1.06, 2.07; p<.021) and 1.59 (CI=1.08, 2.33; p<.018) increased odds of having a normal Hb concentration relative to those living in poor households. Maternal education, anaemia, ANC attendance, and household wealth index are strong determinants of normal Hb concentration among children in Ghana. Strategies aimed at addressing childhood anaemia should take into account maternal anaemia, education, poverty and ANC attendance.","Amugsi, D.

913,"Disrupted white matter integrity in treatment-resistant schizophrenia","Treatment response in schizophrenia is heterogeneous and has been posited to divide into three distinct subcategories: treatment-responsive (first-line responders; FLR), treatment-resistant (TRS, responding to clozapine), and ultra-treatment-resistant schizophrenia (UTRS, requiring augmented antipsychotic therapy). Previous work suggests that white matter abnormalities drive antipsychotic resistance but little work has been carried out to identify differences between those with TRS and those with UTRS. The current study aimed to establish whether differences in white matter structure are present across both treatment-resistant subtypes of schizophrenia or if UTRS is distinct from TRS. Diffusion-weighted images were acquired for 18 individuals with TRS, 14 with UTRS, 18 FLR and 20 healthy controls. Measures of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and parallel diffusivity (PD) were obtained using tract-based spatial statistics. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post-hoc between-groups t-tests interrogating differences were conducted for each white matter measure. Those with TRS had lower FA than healthy controls across widespread regions of the brain, including the superior longitudinal fasciculus, corpus callosum, thalamic radiation, corticospinal tract, internal capsule, corona radiata and fronto-occipital fasciculus (p<.05 FWE-corrected). Lower FA was also observed in those with TRS compared with UTRS in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (p<.05 FWE-corrected). However, post-hoc tests failed to survive corrections for multiple comparisons across the 12 post-hoc contrasts. No differences in MD, PD or RD were observed between groups. These data suggest that TRS is distinct from UTRS and that lower FA could act as a biomarker of treatment resistance in people with schizophrenia.","Mcnabb, C. B.; Mcilwain, M. E.; Anderson, V.

634,"Polygenic risk scores predict diabetic complications and their response to therapy","Type 2 diabetes increases the risk of cardiovascular and renal complications, but early risk prediction can lead to timely intervention and better outcomes. Through summary statistics of meta-analyses of published genome-wide association studies performed in over 1.2 million of individuals, we combined 9 PRS gathering genomic variants associated to cardiovascular and renal diseases and their key risk factors into one logistic regression model, to predict micro- and macrovascular endpoints of diabetes. Its clinical utility in predicting complications of diabetes was tested in 4098 participants with diabetes of the ADVANCE trial followed during a period of 10 years and replicated it in three independent non-trial cohorts. The prediction model adjusted for ethnicity, sex, age at onset and diabetes duration, identified the top 30% of ADVANCE participants at 3.1-fold increased risk of major micro- and macrovascular events (p=6.3x10-21 and p=9.6x10-31, respectively) and at 4.4-fold (p=6.8x10-33) increased risk of cardiovascular death compared to the remainder of T2D subjects. While in ADVANCE overall, combined intensive therapy of blood pressure and glycaemia decreased cardiovascular mortality by 24%, the prediction model identified a high-risk group in whom this therapy decreased mortality by 47%, and a low risk group in whom the therapy had no discernable effect. Patients with high PRS had the greatest absolute risk reduction with a number needed to treat of 12 to prevent one cardiovascular death over 5 years. This novel polygenic prediction model identified people with diabetes at low and high risk of complications and improved targeting those at greater benefit from intensive therapy while avoiding unnecessary intensification in low-risk subjects.","Tremblay, J.; Haloui, M.; Harvey, F.; Tahir, R.; Marois-Blanchet, F.-C.; Long, C.; Attaoua, R.; Simon, P.; Santucci, L.; Hizel, C.; Chalmers, J.; Marre, M.; Harrap, S.; Cifkova, R.; Krajcoviechova, A.; Matthews, D.; Williams, B.; Poulter, N.; Zoungas, S.; Colagiuri, S.; Mancia, G.; Grobbee, D.

644,"Effect of indoor air pollution on infant and child-mortality in Myanmar: Evidence from the first Demographic and Health Survey","Background: Indoor air pollution (IAP) from solid fuels for cooking has been considered as a public health threat, particularly for women and children in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs). We investigated the effects of solid fuel use (SFU) on neonatal, infant and under-five child mortality in Myanmar. Materials and Methods: We used data from Myanmars first Demographic and Health Survey conducted in 2016. The sample consists of ever-married mothers with under-five children in the household (n=3249). We calculated the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) to investigate the effects of SFU on neonatal, infant, and under-five mortality using multivariable logistic regression model accounting for survey weight and clustering. Additional analysis was conducted using an augmented measure of the exposure to IAP accounting for both SFU and the location of cooking (high exposure, moderate, and unexposed). Results: The prevalence of SFU was 79.0%, and the neonatal, infant and the under-five mortality rates were 26, 45 and 49 per 1,000 live births, respectively. The odds of infant (aOR 2.17, 95% CI: 1.21, 3.88) and under-five child mortality (aOR 2.22, 95% CI: 1.24, 3.95) were higher in households with SFU compared with households with clean fuel use. When applying an augmented measure of exposure to IAP by incorporating both SFU and the kitchens location, the likelihood of infant and under-five mortality was higher among moderately and highly exposed children compared to unexposed children with similar trends. Neonatal mortality was not associated with both SFU and levels of exposure to IAP. Conclusion: Infants and under-five children are at higher risk of mortality from exposure to IAP. The findings suggest that the risk of infants and under-five child mortality may be reduced by increasing access to clean cookstoves and clean fuels in LMICs, especially in Myanmar.","Rana, J.; Khan, M.

646,"Predictive approaches to heterogeneous treatment effects: a systematic review","Background: Recent evidence suggests that there is often substantial variation in the benefits and harms across a trial population. We aimed to identify regression modeling approaches that assess heterogeneity of treatment effect within a randomized clinical trial. Methods: We performed a literature review using a broad search strategy, complemented by suggestions of a technical expert panel. Results: The approaches are classified into 3 categories: 1) Risk-based methods (11 papers) use only prognostic factors to define patient subgroups, relying on the mathematical dependency of the absolute risk difference on baseline risk; 2) Treatment effect modeling methods (9 papers) use both prognostic factors and treatment effect modifiers to explore characteristics that interact with the effects of therapy on a relative scale. These methods couple data-driven subgroup identification with approaches to prevent overfitting, such as penalization or use of separate data sets for subgroup identification and effect estimation. 3) Optimal treatment regime methods (12 papers) focus primarily on treatment effect modifiers to classify the trial population into those who benefit from treatment and those who do not. Finally, we also identified papers which describe model evaluation methods (4 papers). Conclusion: Three classes of approaches were identified to assess heterogeneity of treatment effect. Methodological research, including both simulations and empirical evaluations, is required to compare the available methods in different settings and to derive well-informed guidance for their application in RCT analysis.","Rekkas, A.; Paulus, J.

661,"Impact of Radiation on Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients with Resectable Esophageal Cancer","Purpose: Preoperative radiation therapy improves outcomes for operable esophageal cancer patients, though the proximity of the heart to the esophagus puts patients at risk of radiation-induced cardiovascular disease. This study characterizes the impact of radiation therapy and different radiation techniques on cardiovascular morbidity among a large cohort of esophageal cancer patients. Methods: We identified 1,125 Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed between 2000 and 2011 with esophageal cancer who received surgery alone, or surgery preceded by either preoperative chemotherapy or preoperative chemoradiation. We used Medicare claims to identify severe adverse cardiovascular events in the perioperative and postoperative periods. Multivariable logistic regression and Fine-Gray models were used to determine the effect of pre-surgery treatment on the risk of perioperative and postoperative cardiovascular disease. Results: Preoperative chemotherapy or preoperative chemoradiation did not significantly increase the risk of perioperative cardiovascular complications compared to surgery alone. Patients treated with preoperative chemoradiation had a 36% increased risk of having a postoperative cardiovascular event compared to patients treated with surgery alone (subdistribution hazard ratio [SDHR] 1.36; p=0.035). There was no significant increase in cardiovascular events among patients treated with preoperative chemotherapy (SDHR 1.18; p=0.40). Among patients treated with preoperative chemoradiation, those receiving intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) had a 68% decreased risk of having a cardiovascular event compared to patients receiving conventional radiation (SDHR 0.32; p=0.007). Conclusions: This study demonstrates an increased risk of cardiovascular complications among operative esophageal cancer patients treated with preoperative chemoradiation, though these risks might be reduced with more cardioprotective radiation techniques such as IMRT.","Sarkar, R.

660,"Quality of care at safety-net hospitals and the impact on pay-for-performance reimbursement","Background: Pay-for-performance reimbursement ties hospital payments to standardized quality of care metrics. The impact of pay-for-performance reimbursement models on safety-net hospitals, which care primarily for uninsured or underinsured patients, remains poorly defined. This study evaluates how standardized quality of care metrics vary by a hospital's safety-net status, and helps us better understand the potential impact that pay-for-performance reimbursement could have on funding of safety-net hospitals. Methods: We identified 1,703,865 bladder, breast, cervix, colon, endometrium, gastric, lung, ovary, or rectum cancer patients treated at 1,344 hospitals diagnosed between 2004 and 2015. Safety-net burden was defined for each hospital as the percentage of uninsured or Medicaid patients cared for by that hospital. Hospitals were grouped into low-, medium-, and high-burden hospitals. We evaluated the impact of safety-net burden on concordance with 20 standardized quality of care measures, adjusting for differences in patient age, gender, stage at diagnosis, and comorbidity. Results: Patients seen at high-burden hospitals were more likely to be young, male, black, Hispanic, and to reside in a low-income and low-educated region. High-burden hospitals had lower adherence to 13 of 20 quality measures compared to low-burden hospitals (all p<0.05). Among the 350 high-burden hospitals, the quality measures were lowest for those caring for the highest fraction of uninsured or Medicaid patients, minority serving hospitals, and those caring for less educated patients (all p<0.001). Discussion: Cancer care at safety-net hospitals was associated with lower concordance to standardized quality of care measures. Under a pay-for-performance reimbursement model these lower quality of care scores could decrease payments to safety-net hospitals, potentially increasing health disparities for at-risk cancer patients.","Sarkar, R.

655,"Defining predatory journals and responding to the threat they pose: a modified Delphi consensus process","Background: Posing as legitimate open access outlets, predatory journals and publishers threaten the integrity of academic publishing by not following publication best practices. Currently, there is no agreed upon definition of predatory journals, making it difficult for funders and academic institutions to generate practical guidance or policy to ensure their members do not publish in these channels. Methods: We conducted a modified three-round Delphi survey of an international group of academics, funders, policy makers, journal editors, publishers and others, to generate a consensus definition of predatory journals and suggested ways the research community should respond to the problem. Results: A total of 45 participants completed the survey on predatory journals and publishers. We reached consensus on 18 items out of a total of 33, to be included in a consensus definition of predatory journals and publishers. We came to consensus on educational outreach and policy initiatives on which to focus, including the development of a single checklist to detect predatory journals and publishers, and public funding to support research in this general area. We identified technological solutions to address the problem: a 'one-stop-shop' website to consolidate information on the topic and a 'predatory journal research observatory' to identify ongoing research and analysis about predatory journals/publishers. Conclusions: In bringing together an international group of diverse stakeholders, we were able to use a modified Delphi process to inform the development of a definition of predatory journals and publishers. This definition will help institutions, funders and other stakeholders generate practical guidance on avoiding predatory journals and publishers.","Cukier, S.; Lalu, M. M.; Bryson, G. L.; Cobey, K.

659,"Validity of using cancer registry data for comparative effectiveness research","Purpose: Researchers often analyze cancer registry data to assess for differences in survival among cancer treatments. However, the retrospective non-random design of these analyses raise questions about study validity. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which comparative effectiveness analyses using cancer registry data produces results concordant with randomized clinical trials. Methods: We identified 141 randomized clinical trials referenced in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Practice Guidelines for 8 common solid tumor types. For each trial we identified subjects from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) matching the eligibility criteria of the randomized trial. With each trial we used three Cox regression models to determine hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival including univariable, multivariable, and propensity score adjusted models. Multivariable and propensity score analyses controlled for potential confounders including demographic, comorbidity, clinical, treatment, and tumor-related variables. Each NCDB survival analysis was defined as discordant if the HR for the NCDB analysis fell outside the 95% confidence interval of the corresponding randomized trial. Results: NCDB analyses produced HRs for survival discordant with randomized trials in 62 (44%) univariable analyses, 43 (30%) multivariable analyses, and 51 (36%) propensity score models. NCDB analyses produced p-values discordant with randomized trials in 83 (59%) univariable analyses, 76 (54%) multivariable analyses, and 78 (55%) propensity score models. We did not identify any clinical trial characteristic associated with discordance between NCDB analyses and randomized trials including disease site, type of clinical intervention, or severity of cancer. Conclusion: Comparative effectiveness research with cancer registry data often produces survival outcomes discordant to randomized clinical data. These findings help provide context for providers interpreting observational comparative effectiveness research in oncology.","Kumar, A.; Guss, Z. D.; Courtney, P.

643,"Unsupervised clustering of missense variants in the HNF1A gene using multidimensional functional data aids clinical interpretation","Background: Exome sequencing in diabetes presents a diagnostic challenge as depending on frequency, functional impact and genomic and environmental contexts, HNF1A variants can cause Maturity-onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY), increase type 2 diabetes risk, or be benign. A correct diagnosis matters as it informs on treatment, progression, and family risk. We describe a multi-dimensional functional dataset of 73 HNF1A missense variants identified in exomes of 12,940 individuals. Our aim was to develop an analytical framework for stratifying variants along the HNF1A phenotypic continuum to facilitate diagnostic interpretation. Methods: HNF1A variant function was determined by 4 different molecular assays. Structure of the multi-dimensional dataset was explored using principal component analysis, k-means, and hierarchical clustering. Weights for tissue-specific isoform expression and functional domain were integrated. Functionally annotated variant subgroups were used to re-evaluate genetic diagnoses in national MODY diagnostic registries. Findings: HNF1A variants demonstrated a range of behaviours across the assays. The structure of the multi-parametric data was shaped primarily by transactivation. Using unsupervised learning methods, we obtained high-resolution functional clusters of the variants which separated known causal MODY variants from benign and type 2 diabetes risk variants and led to reclassification of 4% and 9% of HNF1A variants identified in the UK and Norway MODY diagnostic registries, respectively. Interpretation: Our proof-of-principle analyses facilitated informative stratification of HNF1A variants along the continuum, allowing improved evaluation of clinical significance, management and precision medicine in diabetes clinics. Transcriptional activity appears a superior readout supporting pursuit of transactivation-centric experimental designs for high-throughput functional screens.","Althari, S.; Najmi, L. A.; Bennett, A.

654,"Physicians learning in the workplace: use of informal feedback cues in daily practice","Purpose: We expect physicians to be lifelong learners. Learning from clinical practice is an important potential source for that learning. To support physicians in this process, a better understanding of how they learn in clinical practice is necessary. This study investigates how physicians use informal feedback as learning cues to adjust their communication from interactions with patients in the outpatient setting. Methods: To understand how physicians use of informal feedback, we combined non-participant ethnographic observations with semi-structured interviews. We enrolled 10 respiratory physicians and observed 100 physician-patient interactions at one academic and one non-academic hospital in the Netherlands. Data collection and analysis were performed iteratively according to the principles of constructivist grounded theory. Our conceptual model describes how physicians use cues to reflect on and adjust their communication as well as to further develop their adaptive expertise. Results: In addition to vast variations within and across patient encounters, we observed recurring patterns in physician communications in reaction to specific learning cues. Physicians had learnt to recognise and use different cues to adjust their communication in patient encounters. They established a communication repertoire based on multiple patient interactions, which many saw as learning opportunities, contributing to the development of adaptive expertise. Our findings show differences in sensitivity to recognising learning opportunities in daily practice which was further influenced by contextual, personal and interpersonal factors. Whereas some reported to have little inclination to change, others used critical incidents to fine-tune their communication repertoire, while others constantly reshaped it, seeking learning opportunities in their daily work. Conclusions: There is a large variation in how physicians use learning cues from daily practice. Raising awareness of experiences as potential learning opportunities might enhance their development of adaptive expertise. Learning from daily practice is a collaborative effort and requires a culture that promotes lifelong learning.","Sehlbach, C.; Teunissen, P. W.; Driessen, E. W.; Mitchell, S.; Rohde, G.

806,"Detection of parasite-derived transrenal DNA for the diagnosis of chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection","Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a potentially life-threatening infection endemic to Latin America that has emerged as a global public health issue due to globalization and emigration patterns. Diagnosis of T. cruzi infection is complex, especially for the chronic phase of the disease that is characterized by a low to moderate burden of the difficult to detect, tissue-dwelling, intracellular form of the parasite. Diagnosis relies on a multistep indirect serological detection approach that requires positive results in at least two independent anti-T. cruzi antibody tests. With no gold standard diagnostic method for chronic T. cruzi, new approaches are needed that can more directly test for the presence of the parasite. Here, we report on of the potential utility of a noninvasive diagnostic approach that specifically detects T. cruzi-derived cell-free repeat DNA in the urine of patients who are both serologically positive and negative.","Madrigal, A.

669,"Opening the Black Box of Artificial Intelligence for Clinical Decision Support: A Study Predicting Stroke Outcome","State-of-the-art machine learning (ML) artificial intelligence methods are increasingly leveraged in clinical predictive modeling to provide clinical decision support systems to physicians. Modern ML approaches such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and tree boosting often perform better than more traditional methods like logistic regression. On the other hand, these modern methods yield a limited understanding of the resulting predictions. However, in the medical domain, understanding of applied models is essential, in particular, when informing clinical decision support. Thus, in recent years, interpretability methods for modern ML methods have emerged to potentially allow explainable predictions paired with high performance. To our knowledge, we present in this work the first explainability comparison of two modern ML methods, tree boosting and multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), to traditional logistic regression methods using a stroke outcome prediction paradigm. Here, we used clinical features to predict a dichotomized 90 days post-stroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. For interpretability, we evaluated clinical features importance with regard to predictions using deep taylor decomposition for MLP, shapley values for tree boosting and model coefficients for logistic regression. With regard to performance as measured by AUC values on the test dataset, all models performed comparably: Logistic regression AUCs were 0.82, 0.82, 0.79 for three different regularization schemes; tree boosting AUC was 0.81; MLP AUC was 0.81. Importantly, the interpretability analysis demonstrated consistent results across models by rating age and stroke severity consecutively amongst the most important predictive features. For less important features, some differences were observed between the methods. Our analysis suggests that modern machine learning methods can provide explainability which is compatible with domain knowledge interpretation and traditional method rankings. Future work should focus on replication of these findings in other datasets and further testing of different explainability methods.","Zihni, E.; Madai, V. I.; Livne, M.; Galinovic, I.; Khalil, A.

671,"GBA variants in REM sleep behavior disorder: a multicenter study","Objective: To study the role of GBA variants in the risk for isolated rapid-eye-movement (REM)-sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and conversion to overt neurodegeneration. Methods: A total of 4,147 individuals were included: 1,061 iRBD patients and 3,086 controls. GBA was fully sequenced using molecular inversion probes and Sanger sequencing. We analyzed the effects of GBA variants on the risk for iRBD, age at onset (AAO) and conversion rates. Results: GBA variants were found in 9.5% of iRBD patients compared to 4.1% in controls (odds ratio [OR]=2.45, 95% CI=1.87-3.22, p=1x10-10). The estimated OR for mild p.N370S variant carriers was 3.69, 95% CI=1.90-7.14, p=3.5x10-5, while for severe variant carriers it was 17.55, 95% CI=2.11-145.9, p=0.0015. Carriers of severe GBA variants had an average AAO of 52.8 years, 7-8 years earlier than those with mild variants or non-carriers (p=0.029). Of the GBA variant carriers with available data, 52.5% had converted, compared to 35.6% in non-carriers (p=0.011), with a trend for faster conversion among severe GBA variant carriers. However, the results on AAO and conversion were based on small numbers and should be taken with caution. Conclusions: GBA variants robustly and differentially increase the risk of iRBD. The rate of conversion to neurodegeneration is also increased and may be faster among severe GBA variant carriers, although confirmation will be required in larger samples. Screening for RBD in healthy carriers of GBA variants should be studied as a potential way to identify GBA variant carriers who will develop a synucleinopathy in the future.","Krohn, L.; Ruskey, J.

687,"Identification of de novo mutations in prenatal neurodevelopment-associated genes in schizophrenia in two Han Chinese patient-sibling family-based cohorts","Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a severe psychiatric disorder with a strong genetic component. High heritability of SCZ suggests a major role for transmitted genetic variants. Furthermore, SCZ is also associated with a marked reduction in fecundity, leading to the hypothesis that alleles with large effects on risk might often occur de novo. In this study, we conducted whole-genome sequencing for 23 families from two cohorts with matched unaffected siblings and parents. Two nonsense de novo mutations (DNMs) in GJC1 and HIST1H2AD were identified in SCZ patients. Ten genes (DPYSL2, NBPF1, SDK1, ZNF595, ZNF718, GCNT2, SNX9, AACS, KCNQ1 and MSI2) were found to carry more DNMs in SCZ patients than their unaffected siblings by burden test. Expression analyses indicated that these DNM implicated genes showed significantly higher expression in prefrontal cortex in prenatal stage. The DNM in the GJC1 gene is highly likely a loss function mutation (pLI = 0.94), leading to the dysregulation of ion channel in the glutamatergic excitatory neurons. Analysis of rare variants in independent exome sequencing dataset indicates that GJC1 has significantly more rare variants in SCZ patients than in unaffected controls. Data from genome-wide association studies suggested that common variants in the GJC1 gene may be associated with SCZ and SCZ-related traits. Genes co-expressed with GJC1 are involved in SCZ, SCZ-associated pathways and drug targets. These evidence suggest that GJC1 may be a risk gene for SCZ and its function may be involved in prenatal and early neurodevelopment, a vulnerable period for developmental disorders such as SCZ.","Jiang, S.; Zhou, D.; Wang, Y.-Y.; Jia, P.; Wan, C.; Li, X.; He, G.; Cao, D.; Jiang, X.; Kendler, K.

712,"Motivational Strategies for Stroke Rehabilitation: A Descriptive Cross-sectional Study","Background and Purpose: The addition of motivational strategies to a rehabilitation program is thought to enhance patient adherence and improve outcomes. However, little is known about how rehabilitation professionals motivate stroke patients during rehabilitation. The primary objective of this study was to provide a comprehensive and quantitative list of motivational strategies for stroke rehabilitation. In addition, we aimed to examine (1) whether professionals with more clinical experience used a higher number of motivational strategies, (2) the purpose for using each strategy, and (3) the information considered when choosing strategies. Methods: This descriptive, cross-sectional study was conducted using a web survey with a random sample of 407 rehabilitation professionals including physicians, nurses, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech-language-hearing therapists. Results: We received data for 362 participants. Fifteen strategies were found to be used by more than 75% of the respondents reported using to motivate their patients. Almost all of the respondents reported that they actively listen to and praise their patients to increase patient adherence to rehabilitation programs. Respondents with more clinical experience tended to use a higher number of motivational strategies (rho = 0.208, p < 0.001). For 11 of the 15 strategies selected by more than 75% of respondents, the highest percentage of respondents reported that they used the strategies to make rehabilitation worthwhile for their patients. The majority of respondents reported that they decide which motivational strategy to use by considering comprehensive information regarding the patient health condition, environmental factors, and personal factors. Conclusions: The comprehensive list of motivational strategies obtained may be useful for increasing patient adherence to rehabilitation, especially for professionals with less clinical experience. Furthermore, our findings regarding the purpose for using each strategy and the information used to choose strategies might help rehabilitation professionals to utilize the motivational strategy list.","Oyake, K.; Suzuki, M.; Otaka, Y.; Tanaka, S.",20191112,"Rehabilitation Medicine And Physical Therapy","10.1101/19011023",1,"Satoshi Tanaka","Hamamatsu University School of Medicine","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19011023v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19011023v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc",NA,"The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request."
656,"Acute ischemic stroke alters the brain's preference for distinct dynamic connectivity states","Acute ischemic stroke disturbs healthy brain organization, prompting subsequent plasticity and reorganization to compensate for loss of specialized neural tissue and function. Static resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have already furthered our understanding of cerebral reorganization by estimating stroke-induced changes in network connectivity aggregated over the duration of several minutes. In this study, we utilized dynamic resting-state fMRI analyses to increase temporal resolution to seconds and explore transient configurations of motor network connectivity in acute stroke. To this end, we collected resting-state fMRI data of 31 acute ischemic stroke patients and 17 age-matched healthy controls. Stroke patients presented with moderate to severe hand motor deficits. By estimating dynamic connectivity within a sliding window framework, we identified three distinct connectivity configurations of motor-related networks. Motor networks were organized into three regional domains, i.e. a cortical, subcortical and cerebellar domain. Temporal connectivity patterns of stroke patients markedly diverged from those of healthy controls depending on the severity of the initial motor impairment. Moderately affected patients (n=18) spent significantly more time in a weakly connected configuration that was characterized by low levels of connectivity, both locally as well as between distant regions. In contrast, severely affected patients (n=13) showed a significant preference for transitions into a spatially segregated connectivity configuration. This configuration featured particularly high levels of local connectivity within the three regional domains as well as anti-correlated connectivity between distant networks across domains. A third connectivity configuration represented an intermediate connectivity pattern compared to the preceding two, and predominantly encompassed decreased inter-hemispheric connectivity between cortical motor networks independent of individual deficit severity. Alterations within this third configuration thus closely resembled previously reported ones originating from static resting-state fMRI studies post-stroke. In summary, acute ischemic stroke not only prompted changes in connectivity between distinct functional networks, yet also caused severe aberrations in temporal properties of large-scale network interactions depending on the individual deficit severity. These findings offer new vistas on the dynamic neural mechanisms underlying acute neurological symptoms, cortical reorganization and treatment effects in stroke patients.","Bonkhoff, A.

784,"An international multicenter examination of MOG antibody assays","Objectives: To compare the reproducibility of 11 antibody assays for IgG and IgM myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies (MOG-IgG, MOG-IgM) from five international centers. Methods: The following samples were analyzed: MOG-IgG clearly positive sera (n=39), MOG-IgG low positive sera (n=39), borderline negative sera (n=13), clearly negative sera (n=40), and healthy blood donors (n=30). As technical controls, 18 replicates (9 MOG-IgG positive and 9 negative) were included. All samples and controls were re-coded, aliquoted, and distributed to the five testing centers which performed the following antibody assays: five live and one fixed immunofluorescence cell-based assays (CBA-IF, five MOG-IgG, one MOG-IgM), three live flow cytometry cell-based assays (FACS-CBA, all MOG-IgG), and two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA, both MOG-IgG). Results: We found excellent agreement (96%) between the live CBAs for MOG-IgG for samples previously identified as clearly positive or negative from four different national testing centers. The agreement was lower with fixed CBA-IF (90%) and the ELISA showed no concordance with CBAs for detection of human MOG-IgG. All CBAs showed excellent inter-assay reproducibility. The agreement of MOG-IgG CBAs for borderline negative (77%) and particularly low positive (33%) samples was less good. Finally, most samples from healthy blood donors (97%) were negative for MOG-IgG in all CBAs. Conclusion: Live MOG-IgG CBAs showed excellent agreement for high positive and very good agreement for negative samples at four international testing centers. Low positive samples were more frequently discordant than in similar assays for other autoantigens.

738,"Factors associated with risk of developmental delay in preschool children in a setting with high rates of malnutrition: a cross-sectional analysis of data from the IHOPE study, Madagascar","Background: Madagascar has one of the highest rates of stunting and at-risk child development in the world:50% of Malagasy children have moderate to severe stunting. In 2016, a new 10 year National Nutrition Action Plan (PNAN III), supported by the World Bank, was initiated to help address stunting and developmental delay. PIVOT, a health care NGO operating in collaboration with the MOH, conducts a longitudinal study, the IHOPE, to assess the population level impact of their collaborative health system strengthening activities on the rural district of Ifanadiana in southeastern Madagascar. We report factors associated with risk to developmental delay in children ages 3 and 4 years old in Ifanadiana district in 2016. Methods: The household survey data are from a cross-sectional analysis of a one wave of panel data in 2016, at the time of the initiation of PNAN III. Women ages 15 to 49 were interviewed, using the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) Early Child Development Indicator (ECDI) module, which includes questions for physical, socio-emotional, learning and literacy/numeracy domains. ECDI data were analyzed using standardized z scores for relative relationships. We assessed 2 outcomes: at risk for delayed development compared to an international standard, and lower development than peers if ECDI z scores were <1 standard deviation below the international normed population and study mean, respectively. Covariates included demographics (maternal age, education level, household wealth, number of other children under 5 in the house), adult involvement (reading, singing, playing with child), household environment (number and type of childrens books or toys, whether child was left alone or in the care of another child <10 years), and child health (wasting, stunting, underweight, ill in last 4 weeks, vaccination status). We included variables significant in univariable analysis at an alpha of <0.1 in a multivariable model. We constructed the final models using backward stepwise regression on generalized linear models, clustered at the sampling level. Results: Of 432 children ages 3 and 4 years, 173 were at risk for delay compared to international norms and 68 children (16.0%) were considered lower-development compared to their peers. 50.5% of the children had moderate to severe stunting and 19.0% had severe stunting. Greater paternal engagement (OR 1.59(1.13, 2.21)) was associated with being at risk for delay based on ECDI z scores <-1 compared to international norms Factors associated with lower risk for delay included having some adult play with the child and greater engagement from a non-parental adult. Factors associated with low development compared to peers included: under age 5 in the household, having a teenaged mother (age <20 years--OR3.89 (1.32, 11.48)), and having an adult who recently took the child outside. Factors associated with less developmental risk included increased number of developmentally stimulating activities by someone other than a parent(OR 0.28(0.16, 0.50)), and primary child toys are found objects rather than store bought or homemade(OR 0.33 (0.14, 0.73)). Discussion: In this setting of high malnutrition, stunting in children is not associated with lower-development compared to their peers, when adjusting for other factors. Families with teenaged mothers are more likely to have children with lower-development. Non-parent adult involvement seems very relevant to child development in this setting. Further research in the IHOPE longitudinal study may help to clarify direction of association. Interventions targeting adolescent girls before they become parents may be of particular utility in this setting.","Miller, A.

663,"Achieving coordinated national immunity and cholera elimination in Haiti through vaccination","Background Cholera was introduced into Haiti in 2010. Since, there have been over 820,000 reported cases and nearly 10,000 deaths. The year 2019 has seen the lowest reported number of cases since the epidemic began. Oral cholera vaccine (OCV) is safe and effective, but has generally not been seen as a primary tool for cholera elimination due to a limited period of protection and constrained supplies. Regionally, epidemic cholera is contained to the island of Hispaniola. Hence, Haiti may represent a unique opportunity to eliminate cholera by use of OCV. Methods We assess the probability of elimination and the potential health impact of OCV use in Haiti by leveraging simulations from four independent modeling teams. For a 10-year projection period, we compared the impact of five vaccination campaign scenarios, differing in geographic scope, vaccination coverage, and rollout duration to a status quo scenario without vaccination. Teams used common calibration data and assumptions for vaccine efficacy and vaccination scenarios, but all other model features and assumptions were determined independently. Findings A two-department OCV campaign proposed in Haiti's national plan for elimination had less than 50% probability of elimination across models, and only ambitious, nationwide campaigns had a high probability of reaching this goal. Despite their low probability of elimination, two-department campaigns averted a median of 13-58% of infections across models over the five years after the start of vaccination campaigns; a nationwide campaign implemented at the same coverage and rollout duration averted a median of 58-95% of infections across models. Interpretation Despite recent declines in cholera cases in Haiti, bold action is needed to promote elimination of cholera from the region. Large-scale cholera vaccination campaigns in Haiti offer the opportunity to synchronize nationwide immunity, providing near-term protection to the population while improvements to water and sanitation infrastructure create an environment favorable to long-term cholera elimination.","Lee, E.

867,"Redefining multiple sclerosis phenotypes using MRI","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is subdivided into four phenotypes on the basis of medical history and clinical symptoms. These phenotypes are defined retrospectively and lack clear pathobiological underpinning. Since Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) better reflects disease pathology than clinical symptoms, we aimed to explore MRI-driven subtypes of MS based on pathological changes visible on MRI using unsupervised machine learning. In separate train and external validation sets we looked at a total of 21,170 patient-years of data from 15 randomised controlled trials and three observational cohorts to explore MRI-driven subtypes and test whether these subtypes had differential clinical outcomes. We processed MRI data to obtain measures of brain volumes, lesion volumes, and normal appearing white matter T1/T2. We identified three MRI-driven subtypes who were similar in how they accumulated MRI abnormality. Based on the earliest abnormalities suggested by our model they were called: cortex-led, normal appearing white matter-led, and lesion-led subtypes. In the external validation datasets, the lesion-led subtype showed a faster disability progression and higher disease activity than the cortex-led subtype. In all datasets, MRI-driven subtypes were associated with disability progression ({beta}Subtype=0.04, p=0.02; {beta}Stage=-0.06, p<0.001), whilst clinical phenotypes and baseline disability were not. Only the lesion-led subtype showed a significant treatment response in three progressive multiple sclerosis randomised controlled trials (-66%, p=0.009) and in three relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis trials (-89%, p=0.04). Our results show that MRI-driven subtyping using machine learning can prospectively enrich clinical trials with patients who are most likely to respond to treatments.","Eshaghi, A.; Young, A.; Wijertane, P.; Prados, F.; Arnold, D.; Narayanan, S.; Guttmann, C.

668,"A panel of synapse assembly genes as a biomarker for Gliomas","Gliomas are the most common primary brain cancers. In recent years, IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion have been suggested as biomarkers for the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of gliomas. However, these biomarkers are only effective for a part of glioma patients and thus more biomarkers are still emergently needed. Recently, an electrochemical communication between normal neurons and glioma cells by neuro-glioma synapse has been reported. Moreover, it was discovered that breast-to-brain metastasis tumor cells have pseudo synapses with neurons and these synapses were indicated to promote tumor progression and metastasis. Based on the above observations, we first curated a panel of 66 SA genes and then proposed a metric, SA score, to quantify the synapseness for each sample of 12 glioma gene expression datasets from TCGA, CGGA, and GEO. Strikingly, SA score showed excellent predictive ability for the prognosis, diagnosis, and grading of gliomas. Moreover, being compared with the two established biomarkers, IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion, SA score was demonstrated independent and better predictive performance. In conclusion, this study revealed that SA genes contribute to glioma formation and development, and proposed a quantitative method, SA score, as an efficient biomarker for monitoring gliomas.","Ji, X.; Zhang, H.; Cui, Q.",20191104,"Oncology","10.1101/19011114",1,"Qinghua Cui","Peking University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19011114v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19011114v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"The datasets supporting the conclusions of this article are available in TCGA repository, https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/, the FireBrowse repository, http://firebrowse.org/, the CGGA repository, http://www.cgga.org.cn/ and GEO repository, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gds/.

673,"Prevalence of malnutrition and associated factors among adult patients on Antiretroviral Therapy follow up care in Jimma Medical Center, Southwest Ethiopia.","Abstract Background: Malnutrition especially under nutrition is the main problem that is seen over people living with HIV/AIDS and can occur at any age. Multiple factors contributed to malnutrition of HIV/AIDS patients and it need immediate identification and prompt action. The objective of this study was to assess the nutritional status of patients and identify factors associated with malnutrition among HIV/AIDS patients on follow-up care in Jimma medical center, Southwest Ethiopia. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was conducted from March-April, 2016. Data was collected retrospectively from clinical records of HIV/AIDS patients enrolled for follow up care in ART clinic from June 2010 to January 2016. Binary and multiple variable logistic regression was done to identify independent predictor of malnutrition. Results: Data of 971 patients were included in the study. The prevalence of under nutrition (BMI<18.5) was (36.8%) (95% CI: 33.8%-39.8%) and out of which severe malnutrition accounts 9.7%. Overweight and obese was 8.6%. Malnutrition was more likely among widowed patients (AOR=1.7, 95% CI, 1.034-2.798), patients in the WHO clinical AIDS staging of three (AOR=2.3, 95% CI, 1.392-3.693) and four (AOR=3.2, 95% CI, 1.667-5.943), patients with CD4 cell count of <200 cells/mm3 (AOR=2.0, 95% CI, 1.463-2.837) and patients with a functional status of bedridden (AOR=4.677, 95% CI, 1.761-12.419) and ambulatory (AOR=2.763, 95% CI, 1.833-4.165). Conclusion: Both under nutrition and overweight are prevalent among HIV/AIDS patients in Jimma Medical Center, Ethiopia. Malnutrition was significantly associated with clinical outcome of patients. Hence, nutritional assessment, care and support should be strengthened. Critical identification of malnourished patients and prompt interventions should be undertaken.","Daka, D. W.; Ergiba, M.

740,"The role of IgM testing in the diagnosis and post-treatment follow-up of syphilis: a prospective cohort study","Objectives: The diagnosis of repeat syphilis and its follow-up remains challenging. We aimed to investigate if IgM testing may assist in the diagnosis of syphilis reinfection/relapse and its treatment follow-up. Methods: Sera were collected from 120 individuals with a new diagnosis of syphilis (72 with repeat infections) and 30 syphilis negative controls during a cohort study investigating syphilis biomarkers conducted at a STI/HIV clinic in Antwerp, Belgium. Syphilis was diagnosed based on a simultaneous positive treponemal and non-treponemal assay result and/or positive serum PCR targeting polA. Specimens collected at visit of diagnosis, and 3 and 6 months post-treatment were tested by two enzyme immuno assays (EIAs), recomWell (Mikrogen; MI) and Euroimmun (EU), to detect anti-treponemal IgM. Baseline specimens were also tested for anti-treponemal IgM using a line immuno assay (LIA) recomLine (Mikrogen). Quantitative kinetic decay curves were constructed from the longitudinal quantitative EIA results. Results: An overall sensitivity for the diagnosis of syphilis of 59.8 % (95 % confidence interval (CI): 50.3-68.7), 75.0 % (95 %(CI): 66.1-82.3) and 64.2 % (95 %(CI): 54.8-72.6) was obtained for the EU, MI EIAs, and MI LIA, respectively. When only considering repeat syphilis, the diagnostic sensitivity decreased to 45.7 % (95 %(CI): 33.9-58.0), 63.9 % (95 %(CI): 51.7-74.6) and 47.2 % (95 %(CI): 35.5-59.3), respectively. IgM seroreverted in most cases 6 months after treatment. Post-treatment IgM concentrations decreased 30 % faster for initial syphilis compared to repeat infection. The IgM EIAs and IgM LIA agreed from fairly to moderately (Cohen's kappa: 0.36 [EU EIA]; Cohen's kappa: 0.53 [MI EIA]; Cohen's kappa: 0.40 [MI LIA]) with the diagnosis of syphilis. Conclusions: IgM detection was not a sensitive method to diagnose syphilis and was even poorer in the diagnosis of syphilis repeat infections, but might play a role in treatment follow-up.","Osbak, K.

907,"Plasma Proteome Analysis of Patients with Hereditary Transthyretin-Mediated (hATTR) Amyloidosis Establishes Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL) as a Biomarker of Disease and Treatment Response","Background Hereditary transthyretin-mediated (hATTR) amyloidosis is a rare, progressively debilitating, and fatal disease caused by deposition of aggregated transthyretin amyloid in multiple organs and tissues. Highly variable disease penetrance has made it difficult to predict disease onset and progression. Clinically validated, non-invasive plasma biomarkers may facilitate earlier diagnosis and aid monitoring of disease progression. Methods Plasma levels of >1000 proteins were measured in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy who received either placebo or patisiran in the phase 3 APOLLO study (NCT01960348) and in a cohort of healthy individuals. The impact of patisiran treatment on the time profile of each protein was determined by a linear mixed model at 0, 9, and 18 months. Neurofilament light chain (NfL) protein was further assessed using an orthogonal quantitative approach. Findings A significant change in the levels of 66 proteins was observed with patisiran vs placebo, with change in NfL, a marker of neuronal damage, most significant (p<10-20). Analysis of the changes in protein levels demonstrated that the proteome of patients treated with patisiran trended towards healthy individuals at 18 months. Plasma NfL levels in healthy controls were four-fold lower than in patients with hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (16.3 [SD 12.0] pg/mL vs 69.4 [SD 42.1] pg/mL, p<10-16). Levels of NfL at 18 months increased with placebo (99.5 [SD 60.1] pg/mL) and decreased with patisiran treatment (48.8 [SD 29.9] pg/mL). At 18 months, improvement in modified Neuropathy Impairment Score+7 (mNIS+7) in patisiran-treated patients significantly correlated with a reduction in NfL levels (R=0.43, p<10-7). Interpretation The observed correlation of NfL reduction with patisiran treatment and improvement in mNIS+7 suggests it may serve as a biomarker of nerve damage and polyneuropathy in hATTR amyloidosis. This biomarker may enable earlier diagnosis of polyneuropathy in patients with hATTR amyloidosis and facilitate monitoring of disease progression.","Ticau, S.; Sridharan, G.

678,"Prospective Evaluation of a Breast Cancer Risk Model Integrating Classical Risk Factors and Polygenic Risk in 15 Cohorts from Six Countries","PURPOSE Risk-stratified breast cancer prevention requires accurate identification of women at sufficiently different levels of risk. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of a model integrating classical risk factors and a recently developed 313-variant polygenic risk score (PRS) to predict breast cancer risk. METHODS Fifteen prospective cohorts from six countries with 237,632 women (7,529 incident breast cancer patients) of European ancestry aged 19-75 years at baseline were included. Calibration of five-year risk was assessed by comparing predicted and observed proportions of cases overall and within risk categories. Risk stratification for women of European ancestry aged 50-70 years in those countries was evaluated by the proportion of women and future breast cancer cases crossing clinically-relevant risk thresholds. RESULTS The model integrating classical risk factors and PRS accurately predicted five-year risk. For women younger than 50 years, median (range) expected-to-observed ratio across the cohorts was 0.94 (0.72 to 1.01) overall and 0.9 (0.7 to 1.4) at the highest risk decile. For women 50 years or older, these ratios were 1.04 (0.73 to 1.31) and 1.2 (0.7 to 1.6), respectively. The proportion of women in the general population identified above the 3% five-year risk threshold (used for recommending risk-reducing medications in the US) ranged from 7.0% in Germany (~841,000 of 12 million) to 17.7% in the US (~5.3 of 30 million). At this threshold, 14.7% of US women were re-classified by the addition of PRS to classical risk factors, identifying 12.2% additional future breast cancer cases. CONCLUSION Evaluation across multiple prospective cohorts demonstrates that integrating a 313-SNP PRS into a risk model substantially improves its ability to stratify women of European ancestry for applying current breast cancer prevention guidelines.","Wilcox, A.

703,"Microglial activation and tau burden predict cognitive decline in Alzheimer's Disease","Tau pathology, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration are key aspects of Alzheimer's disease. Understanding whether these features predict cognitive decline, alone or in combination, is crucial to develop new prognostic measures and enhanced stratification for clinical trials. Here, we studied how baseline assessments of in vivo tau pathology (measured by [18F]AV-1451 PET), neuroinflammation (indexed via [11C]PK11195 PET) and brain atrophy (derived from structural MRI) predicted longitudinal cognitive changes in patients with Alzheimer's disease pathology. Twenty-six patients (n=12 with clinically probable Alzheimer's dementia and n=14 with amyloid positive Mild Cognitive Impairment) and 29 healthy controls underwent baseline assessment with [18F]AV-1451 PET, [11C]PK11195 PET, and structural MRI. Cognition was examined annually over the subsequent 3 years using the revised Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination. Regional grey-matter volumes, [18F]AV-1451 and [11C]PK11195 binding were derived from fifteen temporo-parietal regions characteristically affected by Alzheimer's disease pathology. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used on each imaging modality separately, to identify the main spatial distributions of pathology. A Latent Growth Curve model was applied across the whole sample on longitudinal cognitive scores to estimate the rate of annual decline in each participant. We regressed the individuals' estimated slope of cognitive decline on the neuroimaging components and examined univariable models with single-modality predictors, and a multi-modality model of prediction, to identify the independent and combined prognostic value of the different neuroimaging markers. PCA identified a single component for the grey-matter atrophy, while two components were found for each PET ligand: one weighted to the anterior temporal lobe, and another weighted to posterior temporo-parietal regions. Across the whole-sample, the single-modality models indicated significant correlations between the slope of cognitive decline and the first component of each imaging modality. In patients, both stepwise backward elimination and Bayesian model selection revealed an optimal predictive model that included both components of [18F]AV-1451 and the first (i.e., anterior temporal) component for [11C]PK11195. However, the MRI-derived atrophy component and demographic variables were excluded from the optimal predictive model of cognitive decline. We conclude that temporo-parietal tau pathology and anterior temporal neuroinflammation predict cognitive decline in patients with symptomatic Alzheimer's disease pathology. This indicates the added value of PET biomarkers in predicting cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease, over and above MRI measures of brain atrophy and demographic data. Our findings also support the strategy for targeting tau and neuroinflammation in disease-modifying therapy against Alzheimer's Disease.","Malpetti, M.; Kievit, R. A.; Passamonti, L.; Jones, P.

675,"Impact of left ventricular assist devices and heart transplant on acute myocardial infarction and heart failure mortality and readmission measures","Abstract Background: Concern has been raised about consequences of including patients with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or heart transplantation (HT) in readmission and mortality measures. Methods: We calculated unadjusted and hospital-specific 30-day risk-standardized mortality (RSMR) and readmission (RSRR) rates for all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with a primary diagnosis of AMI or HF discharged between July 2010 and June 2013. Hospitals were compared before and after excluding LVAD and HT patients. LVAD indication was measured. Results: For the AMI and HF cohorts, <0.2% of patients received an LVAD and <0.1% received HT in either cohort. Less than 2% of hospitals had either >6 patients who received an LVAD or, independently, had >1 HT. The AMI mortality and readmission cohorts used 1.8% and 2.8% of LVADs for semi-permanent/permanent indications, versus 73.8% and 78.0% for HF patients, respectively. The rest were for temporary/external indications. In the AMI cohort, RSMR for hospitals without LVAD patients versus hospitals with >6 LVADs was 14.8% and 14.3%, and RSRR was 17.8% and 18.3%, respectively; the HF cohort RSMR was 11.9% and 9.7% and RSRR was 22.6% and 23.4%, respectively. In the AMI cohort, RSMR for hospitals without versus with HT patients was 14.7% and 13.9% and RSRR was 17.8% and 17.7%, respectively; in the HF cohort, RSMR was 11.9% and 11.0%, and RSRR was 22.6% and 22.6%, respectively. Estimations changed <0.1% after excluding LVAD or HT patients. Conclusion: Hospitals caring for >6 patients with LVAD or >1 HT had lower RSMRs but higher RSRRs on average. Rates were insignificantly changed when these patients were excluded. LVADs were primarily for acute-care in the AMI cohort and chronic support in the HF cohort. LVAD and HT patients are a distinct group with differential care requirements and outcomes, thus should be considered separately from the rest of the HF cohort.","Brandt, E. J.; Ross, J.

685,"Influence of sexual risk behaviour and STI co-infection dynamics on the evolution of HIV set point viral load in MSM.","HIV set-point viral load (SPVL) is an important predictor of HIV progression and transmission. Although it has been reported that anti-retroviral therapy (ART) reduces viral load (VL), increased SPVL levels have been observed in MSM in the decade following the introduction of ART in the Netherlands. Several studies have been devoted to explain these counter-intuitive trends in SPVL. However, to our knowledge, none of these studies has investigated an explanation in which it arises as the result of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) co-factor in detail. In this study, we adapted an event-based, individual-based model to investigate how STI co-infection and sexual risk behaviour affect the evolution of HIV SPVL in MSM before and after the introduction of ART. The results suggest that both STI co-factors and sexual risk behaviour have an effect on SPVL. However, the observed trends in SPVL cannot be explained by sexual risk behaviour and STI co-factors only. We recommend to develop mathematical models including also factors related to viral evolution as reported earlier in the literature. However, this requires more complex models, and the collection of more data for parameter estimation than what is currently available.","Hendrickx, D.

Methods: Using two methods of cluster detection, Morans I and spatial scan statistics, we analyzed the geospatial and temporal distribution of disease cases and rates across Barbados for dengue fever in 2013-2016, and a 2014 chikungunya outbreak. Results: During years with high numbers of dengue cases, hotspots for cases were found with Morans I in south and central regions in 2013 and 2016, respectively. Using smoothed disease rates, clustering was detected every year for dengue. Hotspots were not detected via spatial scan statistics, but coldspots suggesting lower rates of disease activity were found in southwestern Barbados during high case years of dengue. Conclusions: Spatial analysis of surveillance data is useful in identifying outbreak hotspots, complementing existing early warning systems. We caution that these methods should be used in a manner appropriate to available data, and reflecting explicit public health goals--managing for overall case numbers, or targeting anomalous rates for further investigation.","Lippi, C.; Stewart-Ibarra, A.

682,"Influence of Chinese eye exercises on myopia control in an East Asian population: a meta-analysis","Objective: The rates of myopia (-0.50 diopter), and high myopia ([&ge;] -6.0 diopter) have been increasing in East Asian populations; the reasons for which may include the combinations of genetic, environment and behavioural factors. The most affected demography point to the young elite population of intellectuals produced from universities. Of the several recommendations to address the myopia epidemic, the influence of Chinese eye exercises (CEE) have been examined. However, reports have been inconsistent, prompting a meta-analysis to obtain more precise estimates. Methods: Eight articles were included in the meta-analysis where we operated on the hypothesis that CEE either increased or reduced myopia control. We compared the subjects that performed CEE against those that did not. We used and estimated odds ratios [ORs] and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the generic inverse variance method. Subgroup analysis involved quality (high/serious and low/non-serious) and frequency (> 5 times/week) of performing CEE comprised. Heterogeneity was subjected to outlier treatment which split the findings into pre- (PRO) and post- (PSO) outlier. The strength of evidence in our findings were based on high significance (Pa < 10-5), surviving the Bonferroni correction and homogeneity (I2 = 0%). Outcomes with these features comprised our core findings. Results: Our core findings were found in the PSO overall indicating elevated myopia control (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.61-0.86, Pa = 0.0002) and CEE subgroups (Serious: OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.68-0.84, Pa < 10-5; Frequent: OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.45-0.68, Pa < 10-5). The low quality subgroup outcome was null in PRO (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.50-1.86, Pa = 0.92) but conveyed significantly less myopia control in PSO (OR1.57, 95% CI 1.24-2.01, Pa = 0.0002). Conclusions: This meta-analysis found that CEE afforded 28% greater control of myopia. Enabled by outlier treatment, this finding was homogeneous and consistent. Subgroup effects elevated myopia control to 62% when CEE was done up to 5 times a week. Improper CEE performance implied reduced myopia control of up to 57%.","Sangvatanakul, P.; Tangthianchaichana, J.; Tasanarong, A.; Pabalan, N.; Tharabenjasin, P.",20191105,"Ophthalmology","10.1101/19011270",1,"Noel Pabalan","Thammasat University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19011270v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19011270v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"Available upon request"

The subjects were divided into two groups including with and without constipation. Subjects were assigned into one of the 4 groups (G1-4) based on the prevalence of 1) CP and 2) Constipation. Subjects were assigned as CP with constipation (G1), CP without constipation (G2), and controls without CP with constipation (G3) and without CP and without constipation (G4). Subject demographics, use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), motor function, caregiver priorities and child health index of life with disabilities (CPCHILD) were included. In addition to medical metadata, a subset of subjects was evaluated for oral and systemic inflammation through gingival bleeding and serum cytokine levels (TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10) respectively. Statistical significance was evaluated by ANOVA One-Way (parametric data) and Kruskal Wallis (non-parametric data). Results: A significant relationship was found between the type of medication and constipation. Subjects taking GABA and GABA+ (GABA in association with other medication) were more likely to be constipated than the other groups (P < 0.01). Additionally, quality of life was directly correlated with constipation; subjects in G1 presented the lower mean score of CPCHILD (49.0 SD13.1) compared to G2 (71.5 SD 16.7) when compared to G3 (88.9 SD 7.5), and G4 (95.5 SD5.0) (P < 0.01). Inflammation was more severe for patients in G1 (P < 0.001). There were no differences among groups regarding gender (P = 0.332) and age (P = 0.292). Conclusions: Our results suggest that constipation was mostly affected by the use of certain antiepileptic drugs, namely GABA. This showed a direct detrimental effect on CP quality of life, which was influenced by inflammatory cytokines and the dosage and type of AEDs.","Ferreira, A. C.

680,"The Effect of Altered Neural Inputs and Botulinum Neurotoxin Chemical Denervation on the Passive Biomechanical Properties of Hand and Wrist Muscles in Chronic Hemiparetic Stroke","Background and Purpose: Following a hemiparetic stroke, prolonged altered motor neuronal inputs may drive passive mechanical changes within muscle that further amplify the brain injury induced motor impairments, reducing optimal recovery. However, due to confounding factors, i.e. muscle hyperactivity and botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) chemical denervation, there is no consensus on how altered neural inputs following a stroke may affect the muscle's passive mechanical properties. Therefore, the goal of this study is to understand how passive mechanical properties of muscles adapt to prolonged altered neural inputs by minimizing and controlling for muscle hyperactivity and BoNT. Methods: Passive torques about the wrist and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints were quantified in the paretic and non-paretic wrist/fingers of 34 individuals with chronic hemiparetic stroke. Participants' hand impairments ranged from severe to mild and included a group who received BoNT injections. Torques were quantified with the subjects in a sleep or near-sleep state to mitigate muscle hyperactivity and EMGs were continuously monitored to ensure no muscle activity during data collection. Results: Our findings indicate that the passive mechanics of wrist/fingers do not substantially change following a hemiparetic stroke unless the individual previously received BoNT injections. Substantial increases in passive flexion torques were observed in individuals who had received BoNT which resulted in a decrease of up to 68 degrees in passive MCP range of motion in extension. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge this study is the most thorough investigation of in vivo passive elastic torques at the wrist and fingers in chronic hemiparetic stroke. The results indicate increased stiffness observed clinically and in previous studies are likely a result of muscle hyperactivity, or are the result of BoNT injections. Thus, loss of hand function post-stroke is predominately due to motor impairments post stroke suggesting future studies and rehabilitation techniques should focus on these deficits.","Binder-Markey, B.

705,"Performance of the Safer Nursing Care Tool to measure nurse staffing requirements in acute hospitals: a multi-centre observational study","Objectives: To determine the precision of nurse staffing establishments estimated using the SNCT patient classification system, and to assess whether the recommended staff levels correspond with professional judgements of adequate staffing. Setting / population: 81 medical/surgical units in 4 acute care hospitals. Methods: Nurses assessed patients using the SNCT and reported on the adequacy of staffing at least daily for one year. Bootstrap samples of varying sizes were used to estimate the precision of the tool's recommendations for the number of nurses to employ on each unit. Multi-level regression models were used to assess the association between shortfalls from the measured staffing requirement and nurses' assessments of adequate staffing. Results: The recommended minimum sample of 20 days allowed the required number to employ to be estimated with a mean precision of 4.1%. For most units, much larger samples were required to estimate establishments within +/- 1 whole time staff member. Every registered nurse hour per patient day shortfall in staffing was associated with an 11% decrease in the odds of nurses reporting that there were enough staff to provide quality care and a 14% increase in the odds of reporting that necessary nursing care was left undone. No threshold indicating an optimal staffing level was observed. Surgical specialty, patient turnover and more single bedded rooms were associated with lower odds of staffing adequacy. Conclusions: The SNCT can provide reliable estimates of the number of nurses to employ on a unit, but larger samples than the recommended minimum are usually required. The SNCT provides a measure of nursing workload that correlates with professional judgements but the recommended staffing levels may not be optimal. Some sources of systematic variations in staffing requirements for some units are not accounted for. SNCT measurements are a potentially useful adjunct to professional judgements but cannot replace it.","Griffiths, P.; Saville, C.; Ball, J.; Culliford, D.; Pattison, N.; Monks, T.",20191108,"Health Informatics","10.1101/19011320",1,"Peter Griffiths","University of Southampton","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19011320v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19011320v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nd",NA,"Authors are in the process of preparing data for sharing in a publically accessible archive and will do so provided data sharing agreements permit.

707,"Protocol for an observational study evaluating new approaches to modelling diagnostic information from large administrative hospital datasets","Introduction: The Charlson and Elixhauser indices define sets of conditions used to adjust for patients' comorbidities in administrative hospital data. A strength of these indices is the parsimony that results from including only 19 and 30 conditions respectively, but the conditions included may not be the ones most relevant to a specific outcome and population. Our objectives are to: (1) test an approach to developing parsimonious indices for the specific outcome and populations being studied, while comparing performance to the Charlson and Elixhauser indices; and (2) evaluate several approaches that involve models with more diagnosis-related terms and aim to improve prediction performance by capturing more of the information in large datasets. Methods and analysis: This is a modelling study using a linked national dataset of administrative hospital records and death records. The study populations are patients admitted to hospital for acute myocardial infarction, hip fracture, or major surgery for colorectal cancer in England between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2017. The outcome is death within 365 days of the date of admission (acute myocardial infarction and hip fracture) or procedure (colorectal surgery). In the 'First analysis', prognostic indices will be developed based on the presence/absence of individual ICD-10 codes in patients' medical histories. Logistic regression will be used to estimate associations with a full set of sociodemographic and diagnostic predictors from which reduced models (with fewer diagnostic predictors) will be produced using a step-down approach. In the 'Second analysis', models will also account for the timing that each ICD-10 code was last recorded and allow for non-linear relationships and interactions between conditions and the timings of records. Validation will include an overall measure of performance (scaled Brier score) and measures of discrimination (c-statistic) and calibration (such as the Integrated Calibration Index) in bootstrap or cross-validation samples. Sensitivity analyses will include varying the length of medical history analysed, using a comparator that combines the Charlson and Elixhauser sets of conditions, and aggregating ICD-10 codes into clinical groups.","Cowling, T.

706,"Transcriptomics of Type 2 Diabetic and Healthy Human Neutrophils","Objectives: Chronic inflammatory diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular disease, are heterogeneous and often co-morbid, with increasing global prevalence. Uncontrolled type 2 diabetes (T2D) can result in severe inflammatory complications. As neutrophils are essential to inflammation, we conducted RNA-seq transcriptomic analyses to investigate the association between neutrophil gene expression and T2D phenotype. Further, as specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators, including resolvin E1 (RvE1), can actively resolve inflammation, we further surveyed the impact of RvE1 on isolated neutrophils. Methods: Cell isolation and RNA-seq analysis of neutrophils from N=11 T2D and N=7 healthy individuals with available clinical data was conducted. Additionally, cultured neutrophils (N=3 T2D, N=3 healthy) were perturbed with increasing RvE1 doses (0nM, 1nM, 10nM, or 100nM) prior to RNA-seq. Data was evaluated through a bioinformatics pipeline including pathway analysis and post hoc false-discovery rate (FDR)-correction. Results: We observed significant differential expression of 50 genes between T2D and healthy neutrophils (p<0.05), including decreased T2D gene expression in inflammatory- and lipid-related genes SLC9A4, NECTIN2 and PLPP3 (p<0.003). RvE1 treatment induced dose-dependent differential gene expression (uncorrected p<0.05) across groups, including 59 healthy and 216 T2D neutrophil genes. Comparing T2D to healthy neutrophils, 1097 genes were differentially expressed across RvE1 doses, including two significant genes, LILRB5 and AKR1C1, involved in inflammation (p<0.05). Conclusions: Inflammatory- and lipid-related genes were differentially expressed between T2D and healthy neutrophils, and RvE1 dose-dependently modified gene expression in both groups. Unraveling the mechanisms regulating abnormalities in diabetic neutrophil responses could lead to better diagnostics and therapeutics targeting inflammation and inflammation resolution.","Kleinstein, S.

708,"Relations between near-term white matter tract microstructure, medical complications, and 2-year language outcomes after preterm birth","Aim: To determine associations between 2-year language outcomes and near-term equivalent age diffusion MRI (dMRI) white matter tract metrics in a cohort of preterm children. Method: 32 children, gestational age 28.9 (2.4) weeks, underwent dMRI at mean post-menstrual-age 36.4 (1.4) weeks and language assessment with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development - III at 18-24 months. Mean fractional anisotropy (FA) was calculated for 6 white matter tracts. Hierarchical linear regression assessed associations between tract FA, moderating variables, and language. Results: Language outcomes correlated positively with FA of the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF-L) (r = 0.44, p < 0.05), and negatively with FA of the posterior corpus callosum (r = -0.41, p < 0.05). Language-brain associations in the ILF-L were independent of the number of neonatal medical complications. Number of neonatal medical complications moderated the relationship between language and posterior corpus callosum FA. Interpretation: The findings suggest that microstructural properties of white matter tracts in the newborn period are associated with language outcomes in the toddler years. The direction of associations varied by fiber group and may relate to the stage of brain maturation and/or the nature and timing of medical complications related to preterm birth.","Dubner, S.

683,"Physicians in the management and leadership of health care: A systematic review of the conditions conducive to organizational performance","Introduction: The influx of management ideas into health care has triggered considerable debate about if and how managerial and medical logics can co-exist. Recent reviews suggest that clinician involvement in hospital leadership can lead to superior performance. Objective: To systematically explore the conditions instrumental for medical leadership to have an impact on organizational performance. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Psychinfo for peer-reviewed, empirical, English language articles and reviews published between January 1, 2006 and August 12, 2018. We performed a thematic synthesis through inductive line-by-line coding of the included studies. Results: The search yielded 1447 publications, of which 62 were included. Three major themes were identified that described a movement 1. From medical protectionism to management through medicine, 2. From command and control to participatory leadership practices, and 3. Organizational practices to support incidental versus willing leaders. Based on these themes, the authors developed a model to depict conditions that facilitate or impede the influence of medical leadership through a virtuous cycle of management through medicine or a vicious cycle of medical protectionism. Conclusions: This review helps individuals, organizations, educators, and trainers better understand how medical leadership can be both a boon and a barrier to the performance of health care organizations. In contrast to the conventional view of conflicting logics, medical leadership would benefit from a more integrative mental model of management and medicine. Nurturing medical engagement requires participatory leadership enabled through long-term investments at the individual, organizational, and system levels. These combined efforts will enable a shift to new leadership paradigms suitable to the complexity of health care, and establish conditions favorable for large-system transformation and health care reform.

677,"Heterogeneity in prognostic value of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio: a meta-analysis","High pre-treatment values of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) are strongly associated with poorer survival outcomes in cancer patients. Here, we assess heterogeneity in the magnitude of this association and the prognostic potential of the NLR between patient subgroups. We conducted a random effects meta-analysis of 228 published studies (N=75,555 patients) relating NLR with overall survival across 18 cancer types. Cochran's Q test and Higgins I2 statistic were used to assess study heterogeneity. Pooled hazard ratios were compared between groups of studies classified by cancer type, geographic region, therapy type, and cut-off for high NLR to identify study-level characteristics associated with increased prognostic potential of the NLR. Pooled hazard ratios are highest in studies of melanoma and breast cancer and lowest in studies of brain cancer and lung cancer. Radiation as primary treatment also demonstrates a large pooled effect size as compared to other therapies. The NLR has greater prognostic value in certain cancer types and therapeutic regimens. Efforts are needed to comprehensively examine populations in which NLR has maximum prognostic power. Clinically meaningful thresholds for risk stratification should be identified within these patient subgroups to permit prospective validation of the prognostic potential of the NLR.","Howard, R.; Kanetsky, P.

870,"Anxiolytic effects of a galacto-oligosaccharides prebiotic in healthy female volunteers are associated with reduced negative bias and the gut bacterial composition.","Current research implicates pre- and probiotic supplementation as potential mediators for improving symptomology in numerous physical and emotional ailments. The alteration of emotional states via nutrient intake is an attractive concept for clinicians and consumers alike and may be an efficient channel to improved well-being. Here we focus on the period of late adolescence, which is a time of emotional refinement via maturation that significantly influences emotional, social and physical well-being in later years. Effective interventions such as nutritional supplementation in this age group have the potential to offset health-related costs in later life. In this study we examined multiple indices of mood and well-being in 64 healthy females in late adolescence in a 4-week double blind, placebo controlled Galacto-oligosaccharide (GOS) prebiotic supplement intervention. We also obtained stool samples at baseline and follow-up for microbiome sequencing and analyses. We found effects of the GOS intervention on sub-clinical self-reported high trait anxiety, attentional bias, and bacterial abundance, suggesting that dietary supplementation with a GOS prebiotic may be influential in improving indices of pre-clinical anxiety.","Johnstone, N.; Milesi, C.; Burn, O.; Van Den Bogert, B.; Nauta, A.; Hart, K.; Sowden, P.; Burnet, P.

911,"Distinct temporal trends in breast cancer incidence from 1997 to 2016 by molecular subtypes: A population-based study of Scottish cancer registry data","Strategies for breast cancer prevention are informed by assessing whether incidence differs by tumour biology. We describe temporal trends of breast cancer incidence by molecular subtypes in Scotland. Population-based cancer registry data on 72,217 women diagnosed with incident primary breast cancer from 1997 to 2016 were analysed. Age-standardised rates (ASR) and age-specific incidence were estimated by tumour subtype after imputing the 8% of missing oestrogen receptor (ER) status. Joinpoint regression and age- period- cohort models were used to assess whether significant differences were observed in incidence trends by ER status. ER positive tumour incidence steadily increased particularly for women of screening age 50 to 69 years from 1997 till around 2011 (1.6%/year, 95%CI: 1.2 to 2.1). ER negative incidence decreased among all ages at a consistent rate of -0.7%/year (95%CI: -1.5, 0) from around 2000-2016. Compared to the 1941-1959 central birth cohort, women born 1912- 1940 had lower incidence rate ratios (IRR) for ER+ tumours and women born 1960- 1986 had higher IRR for ER- tumours. We show evidence of aetiologic heterogeneity of breast cancer. Future incidence and survival reporting should be monitored by molecular subtypes.","Mesa-Eguiagaray, I.; Wild, S.; Rosenberg, P.; Bird, S. M.; Brewster, D.; Hall, P.

713,"Identification of non-small cell lung cancer subgroups with distinct immuno-therapy outcomes from integrating genomics and electronic health records on a graph convolutional network","Immuno-oncology (IO) therapies have transformed the therapeutic landscape of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, patient responses to IO are variable and influenced by a heterogeneous combination of health, immune and tumor factors. There is a pressing need to discover the distinct NSCLC subgroups that influence response. We have developed a deep patient graph convolutional network, we call DeePaN, to discover NSCLC complexity across data modalities impacting IO benefit. DeePaN employs high-dimensional data derived from both real world evidence (RWE) based electronic health records (EHRs) and genomics across 1,937 IO treated NSCLC patients. DeePaN demonstrated effectiveness to stratify patients into subgroups with significantly different (p-value of 2.2E-11 ) overall survival of 20.35 months and 9.42 months post-IO therapy. Significant differences in IO outcome were not seen from multiple non-graph based unsupervised methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that patient stratification from DeePaN has the potential to augment the emerging IO biomarker of tumor mutation burden (TMB). Characterization of the subgroups discovered by DeePaN indicates potential to inform IO therapeutic insight, including the enrichment of mutated KRAS and high blood monocyte count in the IO beneficial and IO non-beneficial subgroups, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, our work for the first time has proven the concept that graph based AI is feasible and can effectively integrate high-dimensional genomic and EHR data to meaningfully stratify cancer patients on distinct clinical outcomes, with potential to inform precision oncology.","Fang, C.; Xu, D.; Su, J.; Dry, J.; Linghu, B.",20191112,"Health Informatics","10.1101/19011437",1,"Bolan Linghu","Oncology Research and Early Development, Oncology R&D, AstraZeneca, Boston, Massachusetts, 02451, USA","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19011437v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19011437v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"The data source is from the Flatiron NSCLC clinico-genomic Database.

714,"Genomic Epidemiology of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Two Cohorts of High-Risk Military Trainees","Background. MRSA skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) is a significant cause of morbidity in military trainees. To guide interventions, it is critical we understand the epidemiology of MRSA in this population. Methods. Two cohorts ( companies) of US Army Infantry trainees (N=343) at Fort Benning, GA, USA, were followed during their training cycles (Jun.-Dec. 2015). Trainees had nares, oropharynx, perianal and inguinal areas swabbed for MRSA colonization at five ~2-4 week intervals, and monitored for SSTI throughout training. Epidemiological data were collected. Isolates were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq and NovaSeq. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms and clusters were identified. Multi-locus sequence type (MLST) and antimicrobial resistance genes were predicted from de novo assemblies. Results. 87 trainees were positive at least once for MRSA (12 had SSTI, 2 without any colonization). Excluding those positive at baseline, 43.7% were colonized within the first month of training. 244/254 samples were successfully sequenced (including all SSTI). ST8 (n=135, 100% of SSTI), ST5 (n=81) and ST87 (n=21) were the most represented. Three main Clusters were identified, largely corresponding to these STs. Sub-analyses within Clusters showed multiple importations of MRSA, with transmission subsequently predominantly within, rather than between, platoons in each company. Over 50% of trainees were colonized only at other anatomical sites; restricting analyses to nares missed substantial transmission. Conclusions. Serial importations of MRSA into this high-risk setting likely contribute to the ongoing burden of MRSA colonization and infection among military trainees. Sampling multiple anatomical sites is critical for comprehensive characterization of MRSA transmission.","Lee, R. S.; Millar, E. V.; Callendrello, A.; English, C. E.; Elassal, E. M.; Ellis, M.

720,"A pilot biomonitoring study of cumulative phthalates exposure among Vietnamese American nail salon workers","Background: Many California nail salon workers are low-income Vietnamese women of reproductive age who use nail products daily that contain androgen-disrupting phthalates which may increase risk of male reproductive tract abnormalities during pregnancy. Yet, few studies have characterized phthalate exposures among this workforce. Objective: To characterize individual metabolites and cumulative phthalates exposure among a potentially vulnerable occupational group of nail salon workers. Study Design: We collected 17 post-shift urine samples from Vietnamese workers at six San Francisco Bay Area nail salons in 2011, which were analyzed for four primary phthalate metabolites: mono-n-butyl-, mono-isobutyl-, mono(2-ethylhexyl)-, and monoethyl phthalates (MnBP, MiBP, MEHP, and MEP, respectively) (g/L). Phthalate metabolite concentrations and a potency-weighted sum of parent compound daily intake ({Sigma}androgen-disruptor, g/kg/day) were compared to 203 Asian Americans from the 2011-12 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) using Student t-test and Wilcoxin signed rank test. Results: Creatinine-corrected MnBP, MiBP, MEHP (g/g), and cumulative phthalates exposure ({Sigma}androgen-disruptor, g/kg/day) levels were 2.9 (p < 0.0001), 1.6 (p = 0.015), 2.6 (p < 0.0001), and 2.0 (p < 0.0001) times higher, respectively, in our nail salon worker population compared to NHANES Asian Americans. Levels exceeded the NHANES 95th or 75th percentiles among some workers. Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that nail salon workers are disproportionately exposed to multiple phthalates, a finding that warrants further investigation to assess their potential health significance.","Varshavsky, J.

719,"Distinct single cell gene expression in peripheral blood monocytes correlates withtreatment response groups defined by type I interferon in rheumatoid arthritis","Objective: Previously, we have shown that the ratio of IFN{beta}/ activity can predict response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In this study, our objective was to better understand the impact of this type I IFN ratio in monocytes from RA patients. Methods: We compared single cell gene expression in purified classical (CL) and non-classical (NC) monocytes from RA patients. Patients with high vs. low serum IFN{beta}/ ratio were compared to each other, as determined by functional type I IFN assay. Results: We found large differences in monocyte gene expression between patients with different IFN{beta}/ ratios, which was apparent in principal component analysis. Cluster analysis also documented strong differences between these response groups. In CL monocytes, decreased expression of JAK1 and IFI27 were strongly associated with the non-response low IFN{beta}/ ratio. In NC monocytes, increased expression of HLADRB1, TNFA, PDL1, TGFB, and others were associated with the non-response IFN ratio. Interestingly, JAK1 expression was absent in all monocytes from some patients. This pattern was strongly associated with the non-response type I IFN ratio, suggesting a major biological difference between JAK1 expressors and non-expressors. Conclusions: Differences in the ratio of IFN{beta}/ are associated with major changes in gene expression in RA patient monocytes, suggesting differential IFN pathway activation in RA patients who are either more or less likely to respond to TNFi.

789,"Differential asthma risk following respiratory infection in children from three minority populations","Rationale: Severe early-life respiratory illnesses, particularly those caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (HRV), are strongly associated with the development of asthma in children. Puerto Rican children in particular have a strikingly high asthma burden, but prior studies of the potential associations between early-life respiratory illnesses and asthma in Puerto Rican and other minority populations have been limited. Objectives: We sought to determine whether early-life respiratory illness was associated with asthma in Puerto Rican children relative to other minority children. Methods: Using a logistic regression analysis, we examined the association between early-life respiratory illnesses (report of upper respiratory infection (URI), pneumonia, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis/RSV) within the first two years of life and physician-diagnosed asthma after the age of two in a large cohort of minority children. Measurements and Main Results: Early-life respiratory illnesses were associated with greater asthma risk in Puerto Ricans relative to other racial/ethnic minority populations. Specifically, in Puerto Ricans, the odds was 6.15 (95% CI: 4.21-9.05) if the child reported at least one of the following respiratory illness: URI, pneumonia, bronchitis or bronchiolitis. The odds were also higher in Puerto Ricans when considering these conditions separately. Conclusions: We observe population-specific associations between early-life respiratory illnesses and asthma, which was especially significant in Puerto Ricans. Taken together with the known high burden of RSV in Puerto Rico, our results may help explain the high burden of asthma in Puerto Ricans.","Wohlford, E. M.; Borrell, L. N.; Elhawary, J.

733,"Estimating the causal effect of adiposity on carpal tunnel syndrome: a Mendelian randomization study","Background: We aimed to examine evidence for a causal effect of overall and abdominal adiposity on carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR). Methods: The exposure included genetic instruments comprising independent variants associated with body mass index (BMI) (n=322,154), a proxy for overall adiposity, and waist-hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI) (n=210,082), a proxy for abdominal adiposity. Associations of these variants with CTS were obtained from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) conducted in UK Biobank (12,312 CTS cases / 389,344 controls). Causal effects were estimated using inverse-variance weighted regression and conventional MR sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess for horizontal pleiotropy. In follow-up analyses we determined whether type 2 diabetes (T2D) or hyperlipidemia mediated the observed effects. Results: A 1-standard deviation (SD, ~4.7kg/m2) increase in genetically instrumented BMI increased the risk of CTS (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.48-2.02, p=2.68e-12), with consistent effects across sensitivity analyses. This effect translates to an absolute increase of 17 CTS cases per 1000 person years amongst US working populations [95% CI 11.0-23.5]. Univariable MR was consistent with a causal effect of T2D (OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.03-1.11, p=5.20e-05), and the effect of BMI was partially attenuated (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.38-1.68, p=2.85e-08) when controlling for T2D liability in multivariable MR. In contrast, no effect was observed of WHRadjBMI on CTS (OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.74-1.33, p=0.83). Conclusion: These data support a causal effect of overall adiposity on susceptibility to CTS that is only partially mediated through T2D, suggesting that efforts to reduce obesity may mitigate the population burden of CTS.","Daghlas, I.; Varady, N.",20191112,"Neurology","10.1101/19011536",1,"Iyas Daghlas","Harvard Medical School","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19011536v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19011536v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"All summary statistics used for the present analysis are publically available."
730,"Impact of dogs with deltamethrin-impregnated collarson prevalence of visceral leishmaniasis","Leishmaniasis is a vector borne zoonosis which is classified as a neglected tropical disease. Among the three most common forms of the disease, Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) is the most threatening to human health, causing 20,000 to 30,000 deaths worldwide each year. Areas where VL is mostly endemic have unprotected dogs in community and houses. The presence of dogs usually increases VL risk for humans since dogs are the principal reservoir host for the parasite of the disease. Based on this fact, most earlier studies consider culling dogs as a control measure for the spread of VL. A more recent control measure has been the use of deltamethrin-impregnated dog collars (DIDCs) to protect both humans and dogs by putting DIDCs on dogs neck. The presence of dogs helps to grow the sandfly population faster by offering a more suitable blood-meal source. On the other hand, the presence of DIDCs on dogs helps to reduce sandfly population by the lethality of deltamethrin insecticide. This study brings an ecological perspective to this public health concern, aiming to understand the impact of an additional host (here, protected dogs) on disease risk to a primary host (here, humans). To answer this question, we compare two different settings: a community without dogs, and a community with dogs protected with DIDC. Our analysis shows the presence of protected dogs can reduce VL infection risk in humans. However, this disease risk reduction depends on dogs' tolerance for sandfly bites.","Zahid, M.

The aim of the present study to perform a meta-analysis of published studies to validate the association between MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and risk of lung cancer. PubMed, Springer Link, Science Direct and Google Scholar databases were searched for eligible studies. Of the 78 initially identified studies, 11 case control studies with 5,996 patients and 7,404 healthy controls were finally included in the present meta-analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated to assess the association, and all statistical analyses were performed using MIX software (version 1.7). No statistically significant associations were found between the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and lung cancer risk in the additive/ allele contrast, co-dominant/heterozygote, homozygote, dominant and recessive genetic models (C vs. A: OR= 0.95, 95% CI= 0.83-1.08; CC vs. AA: OR= 1.13, 95% CI= 0.83-1.5; AC vs. AA: OR= 0.86, 95% CI= 0.70-1.02; AC+CC vs. AA: OR= 0.89, 95% CI= 0.75-1.05; CC vs. AA+AC: OR= 1.20, 95% CI= 0.89-1.40).

726,"Relation between Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase C677T and A1298C Polymorphisms and Migraine Susceptibility","Migraine is a neurological disorder which impairs the patients quality of life. Several association studies investigating the association between MTHFR gene C677T and A1298C polymorphisms and susceptibility to migraine were published. But the results were conflicting, so authors performed a meta-analysis of published case control studies. Four databases were searched for suitable studies up to December, 2018. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was calculated adopting additive, homozygote, co-dominant, dominant, and recessive genetic models. Results of MTHFR C677T polymorphism studies meta-analysis showed significant association with migraine risk using allele contrast, homozygote, dominant and recessive genetic models (T vs. C: OR = 1.18, 95%CI = 1.00-1.26, p= 0.05; TT vs. CC: OR = 1.24, 95%CI = 1.0-1.5, p= 0.04; CT vs. CC: OR = 1.08, 95%CI = 0.97-1.07, p= 0.25; TT+CT vs. CC: OR = 1.15, 95%CI = 1.0-1.29, p= 0.04; TT vs. CT +CC: OR = 1.97, 95%CI = 1.28-3.42, p= 0.002). However, results of MTHFR A1298 polymorphism studies meta-analysis did not show any association with migraine. Subgroup analysis based on ethnicity and migraine types i. e migraine with aura (MA) and without aura (MO) were also performed.

731,"One-week test-retest reliability of nine binocular tests and saccades used in concussion","Background: Tests of binocular vision (BVTs) and ocular motility are used in concussion assessment and management. Purpose: To determine the one-week test-retest reliability of 9 binocular vision tests (BVTs) and a test of saccades proposed for use in concussion management. Study Design: Prospective test-retest. Methods: We examined the one-week test-retest reliability of 9 BVTs in healthy participants: 3D vision (gross stereoscopic acuity), phoria at 30cm and 3m, ability of eyes to move/fixate in-sync (positive and negative fusional vergence at 30cm and 3m, near point of convergence and near point of convergence-break [i.e. double vision]) and 1 ocular motor test, saccades. Results: We tested 10 males and 10 females without concussion and a mean age of 25.5 (4.1) years. The intraclass correlations suggest good reliability for phoria 3m (0.88) and gross stereoscopic acuity (0.86), and moderate reliability for phoria 30cm (0.69), near point of convergence (0.54), positive fusional vergence (0.54) and negative fusional vergence (0.66) at 30cm, and near point of convergence - break (0.64). There was poor reliability for saccades (0.34), and both positive and negative fusional vergence (0.49 and 0.43, respectively) at 3m. Limits of agreement (LoA) were best for saccade (34%) and worst for phoria 30 cm (121%) and ranged from 58% to 70% for 7 of the 8 other tests. The LoA for phoria at 3m were uninformative because measurements for 18 of 20 participants were identical. Conclusion: We found test-retest reliability of the BVTs and saccades ranging from poor to good in healthy participants, with the majority being moderate. Clinical Relevance: For these vision tests to be clinically useful, the effect of concussion must have a moderate to large effect on the scores of most of the tests.","Long, S.; Schuster, T.; Steele, R.; Leclerc, S.; Shrier, I.",20191112,"Sports Medicine","10.1101/19011619",1,"Ian Shrier","Lady Davis Institute, McGill University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19011619v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19011619v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"The raw data on the test-retest scores used in these analyses is available on the Open Science Foundation (https://osf.io/nbskx/wiki/home/)."

Previous FMT clinical trials have considered the possibility of a ""donor effect"", that is, that FMT material from different donors has different clinical efficacies. Here we lay out rigorous statistical methodology for detecting donor effects, finding that reliable detection of a donor effect requires trials with more than 200 FMT-treated patients. A re-evaluation of previous FMT clinical trials for IBD showed that while there is very little evidence for a non-zero donor effect, the existing data are also not inconsistent with substantial donor effects. Large-scale meta-analysis, combined with careful reporting from clinical trials, will be crucial in determining if donor effects are clinically relevant for IBD.","Olesen, S.

762,"Semantic computational analysis of anticoagulation use in atrial fibrillation from real world data","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and significantly increases stroke risk. This risk is effectively managed by oral anticoagulation. Recent studies using national registry data indicate increased use of anticoagulation resulting from changes in guidelines and the availability of newer drugs. The aim of this study is to develop and validate an open source risk scoring pipeline for free-text electronic health record data using natural language processing. AF patients discharged from 1st January 2011 to 1st October 2017 were identified from discharge summaries (N=10,030, 64.6% male, average age 75.3 {+/-} 12.3 years). A natural language processing pipeline was developed to identify risk factors in clinical text and calculate risk for ischaemic stroke (CHA2DS2-VASc) and bleeding (HAS-BLED). Scores were validated vs two independent experts for 40 patients. Automatic risk scores were in strong agreement with the two independent experts for CHA2DS2-VASc (average kappa 0.78 vs experts, compared to 0.85 between experts). Agreement was lower for HAS-BLED (average kappa 0.54 vs experts, compared to 0.74 between experts). In high-risk patients (CHA2DS2-VASc >2) OAC use has increased significantly over the last 7 years, driven by the availability of DOACs and the transitioning of patients from AP medication alone to OAC. Factors independently associated with OAC use included components of the CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores as well as discharging specialty and frailty. OAC use was highest in patients discharged under cardiology (69%). Electronic health record text can be used for automatic calculation of clinical risk scores at scale. Open source tools are available today for this task but require further validation. Analysis of routinely-collected EHR data can replicate findings from large-scale curated registries.","Bean, D.; Teo, J.; Wu, H.; Oliveira, R.; Patel, R.; Bendayan, R.; Shah, A. M.; Dobson, R.

729,"White Matter Alterations in Borderline Personality Disorder","Borderline personality disorder (BorPD) is characterized by instability and impulsivity of mood, relationships and self-image. This disease is an important area of public health policy; compared to other psychiatric disorders, individuals with BorPD experience the most severe functional impairments. Nevertheless, for the patients that do recover, this recovery is stable and only few relapse back to psychopathology. Given its high rate of remission, the rewards of effective treatment options are clear. Identification of underlying anatomical and physiological changes is crucial to refine current treatments and develop new ones. In this perspective, previous magnetic resonance imaging studies have highlighted alterations associated with BorPD phenotype. In particular, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) has identified many white matter structural alterations in individuals with this diagnosis. Although in its infancy, limiting this line of investigation is a lack of direction at the field level. Hence, the present paper aims to conduct a meta-analysis of DWI findings in individuals with a diagnosis of BorPD, testing the hypothesis that there are specific white matter alterations associated with BorPD. To this end, we performed a meta-analysis of the existing literature of DWI in BorPD representing a total of 123 individuals with BorPD and 117 Controls. Our results indicated that individuals with BorPD show regions of reduced fractional anisotropy in the corpus callosum and fornix. These results survived all jack-knife reshuffles and showed no publication bias. This suggest that alterations in these structures may contribute to psychopathology. Further, the present results lend support to extant psychological and biological models of BorPD.","Kelleher-Unger, I.; Tajchman, Z.; Chittano, G.; Vilares, I.",20191112,"Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology","10.1101/19011676",1,"Iris Vilares","Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, University College London, London, United Kingdom; Department of Psychology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, U","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19011676v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19011676v1.full.pdf","cc_by",NA,"This is a meta-analysis of existing papers in the literature and all the data used came from that publicly-available data.

781,"Influence of electromagnetic radiation emitted by daily-use electronic devices on the Eyemate(R) system","Purpose: Eyemate is a system for the continual monitoring of intraocular pressure (IOP), comprised of an intraocular sensor, and a hand-held reader device. The eyemate-IO sensor is surgically implanted in the eye during cataract surgery. Once implanted, the sensor communicates telemetrically with the hand-held device to activate and record IOP measurements. The aim of this study was to assess the possible influence of electromagnetic radiation emitted by daily-use electronic devices on the eyemate IOP measurements. Methods: The eyemate-IO sensor was placed in a plastic bag, immersed in a sterile sodium chloride solution at 0.9% and placed in a water bath at 37 C. The antenna, connected to a laptop for recording the data, was positioned at a fixed distance of 1 cm from the sensor. Approximately two hours of quasi-continuous measurements was recorded for the baseline and for cordless phone, smart-phone and laptop. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare any possible differences between the baseline and the tested devices. Results: For baseline measurements, the sensor maintained a steady-state. The same behavior was observed with the devices measurements during active and inactive states. Conclusion: We found no evidence of signal drifts or fluctuations associated with the tested devices, thus showing a lack of electromagnetic interference with data transmission. Patients who already have the eyemate-IO sensor implanted, or those considering it, can be informed that the electromagnetic radiation emitted by their daily-use electronic devices does not interfere with IOP measurements made by the eyemate-IO sensor.","Invernizzi, A.; Haykal, S.; Lo Faro, V.; Pennisi, V.; Choritz, L.",20191120,"Ophthalmology","10.1101/19011692",1,"Azzurra Invernizzi","University Medical Centre Groningen","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19011692v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19011692v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"data available under request."

724,"Evaluation of the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program","Background: There is conflicting evidence about whether the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) is associated with an increase in mortality. Methods: In a cohort of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with heart failure (HF), we compared two published approaches to evaluating the association of HRRP and risk-adjusted 30-day mortality, including changes in average mortality across periods and changes in slope of monthly mortality rates across discrete periods. We also tested various methods with simulated data that was designed with an inflection in mortality. Results: We identified 4,313,523 hospitalizations for HF, 1,788,219 for AMI, and 3,758,111 for pneumonia. Monthly slope-change models identified an increase in mortality for HF and pneumonia in the pre-HRRP period (P<.001 for slope-change). The changes in average mortality across the four time periods model found an increase in mortality for HF and pneumonia in the HRRP anticipation period (post-announcement, pre-implementation) as well as following HRRP implementation. However, under those conditions, our simulations reveal that method errs in identifying the timing of a change. Varying the data sources and risk-adjustment strategies had no significant effect on the results. Conclusion: A national policy incentivizing efforts to reduce readmission did not increase the risk of mortality.","Khera, R.; Wang, Y.; Bernheim, S. M.; Lin, Z.; Normand, S.-L. T.; Krumholz, H.

721,"Evaluation of the concentration and profile of serum proteins and immunoglobulins in Mexican patients with advanced gastric cancer","Introduction: Gastric cancer remains an important health problem. Its molecular mechanisms and interactions with the immune system are still not well elucidated. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the concentration and profile of serum proteins and immunoglobulins in Mexican patients with advanced gastric cancer. Materials and methods: We performed a descriptive study. Adult patients from both sexes were included. The problem group was formed of patients with advanced gastric cancer and the control group was formed of healthy subjects. Demographic data, gastric cancer histological type and stage of tumor node metastasis (TNM) system were recorded. The profile and concentration of serum proteins and immunoglobulins was determined and analyzed in different subgroups classified by sex, histologic type and stage of TNM system. To compare the concentrations of serum proteins and immunoglobulins the ANOVA test was performed. A p <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: We included 88 patients with advanced gastric cancer and 74 healthy controls. There were no differences in demographic data among the groups, and the most common gastric cancer type was the diffuse (67.04%). Women with gastric cancer from any type presented higher levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) compared with the control group (p <0.001) and men with gastric cancer of intestinal type in TNM stage III presented higher levels of IgG compared with its counterpart of diffuse type (p <0.001). Also, patients with intestinal type gastric cancer presented higher concentrations of alpha-1 globulins compared with patients with the diffuse type (p <0.05). Finally, patients with diffuse gastric cancer TNM stage IV presented the lowest albumin/globulin ratios. Conclusion: There is a greater concentration of serum IgG in some subgroups of patients with advanced gastric cancer, the concentration of alpha-1 globulins is different between the intestinal and diffuse types and the albumin/globulin ratio is lower in the diffuse type.","Diaz Y Orea, M.

768,"Validity of the Cold Pressor Test and Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire via online self-administration","To determine the feasibility of complex home-based phenotyping, 1,876 research participants from the customer base of 23andMe participated in an online version of a Pain Sensitivity Questionnaire (PSQ) as well as a cold pressor test (CPT) which is used in clinical assessments of pain. Overall our online version of the PSQ performed similarly to the original pen-and-paper version. Construct validity of the PSQ total was demonstrated by internal consistency and consistent discrimination between more and less painful items. Criterion validity was demonstrated by correlation with pain sensitivity as measured by the cold pressor test. Within the same cohort we performed a cold pressor test using a layperson description and household equipment. Comparison with published reports from controlled studies revealed similar distributions of cold pain tolerance times (i.e., time elapsed before removing the hand from the water). Of those who elected to participate in the CPT, a large majority of participants did not report issues with the test procedure or noncompliance to the instructions (97%). We confirmed a large sex difference in CPT thresholds in line with published data, such that women removed their hands from the water at a median of 54.2 seconds, with men lasting for a median time of 82.7 seconds (Kruskal-Wallis statistic, p < 0.0001), but other factors like age or current pain treatment were at most weakly associated, and inconsistently between men and women. We introduce a new paradigm for performing pain testing, called testing@home, that, in the case of cold nociception, showed comparable results to studies conducted under controlled conditions and supervision of a health care professional.","Mcintyre, M.; 23andme Research Team,  ; Kless, A.; Hein, P.; Field, M.; Tung, J.

732,"Urinary incontinence among pregnant women in Southern Brazil: a population-based cross-sectional survey","Background: Urinary incontinence (UI) is a frequent pathology that causes significant harm to the well-being and quality of life of pregnant women. This study aimed to measure the prevalence and to identify factors associated with the occurrence of UI during pregnancy in women living in the municipality of Rio Grande (RS), Southern Brazil, in 2016. Methods: This is a cross-sectional population-based study that included all puerperae living in this municipality who had a child in one of the two local maternity hospitals between January 1 and December 31, 2016. The interviews were held at the hospital within 48 hours after delivery, when previously trained interviewers used a single, standardized questionnaire, seeking information on maternal demographic, behavioral and reproductive/obstetric history, as well as socioeconomic status of the household and care received during pregnancy and childbirth. The multivariate analysis followed a previously defined hierarchical model, using Poisson regression with robust variance adjustment and prevalence ratio (PR) as measure of effect. Results: Among the 2,716 puerperae identified, 2,694 (99.2%) participated in this study. The prevalence of urinary incontinence in the gestational period was 14.7% (95%CI: 13.4%-16.1%). The lowest observed UI rate (8.3%) occurred among adolescent mothers (<20 years), while the highest occurred among those who reported frequent urinary urgency (39.2%). The probability of occurrence of UI, even after adjustment, was significantly higher among those who were older than 30 years old at current pregnancy, whose first pregnancy was before the age of 20 or after 30, who reached the end of gestation weighing 90 kg or more, who exercised regularly during pregnancy and who reported frequent urinary urgency during the gestational period. Conclusions: Urinary incontinence showed a high prevalence in the study population. The identified risk factors can be well administered at primary health care level. The recommendation of regular physical exercise in pregnancy must be reviewed and better investigated with more robust designs because of possible facilitators for the occurrence of UI in this period. Keywords: Urinary incontinence, pregnancy, risk factors, prevalence.","Ting, H. Y.; Cesar, J.

739,"Anterolateral entorhinal cortex thickness as a new biomarker for early detection of Alzheimer's disease","Introduction: Loss of entorhinal cortex (EC) layer II neurons represents the earliest AD lesion in the brain. Research suggests differing functional roles between two EC subregions, the anterolateral EC (aLEC) and the posteromedial EC (pMEC). Methods: We use joint label fusion to obtain aLEC and pMEC cortical thickness measurements from serial MRI scans of 775 ADNI-1 participants (219 healthy; 380 MCI; 176 AD) and use linear mixed-effects models to analyze longitudinal associations between cortical thickness, disease status and cognitive measures. Results: Group status is reliability predicted by aLEC thickness, which also exhibits greater associations with cognitive outcomes than does pMEC thickness. Change in aLEC thickness is also associated with CSF amyloid and tau levels. Discussion: Thinning of aLEC is a sensitive structural biomarker that changes over short durations in the course of AD and tracks disease severity; it is a strong candidate biomarker for detection of early AD.","Holbrook, A.; Tustison, N.; Marquez, F.; Roberts, J.; Yassa, M.

842,"Compromised intestinal barrier underlies gut microbiota dysbiosis of intestinal diseases","Despite recent efforts, a single factor underlying the gut microbiota dysbiosis in intestinal diseases is not identified. We hypothesized that compromised intestinal barrier (CIB) could lead to increased host-derived contents including human cells in the gut, change its physio-metabolic properties, and globally alter gut microbiota and their metabolic capacities. Consistently, we found human DNA contents (HDCs), calculated as the percentage of metagenomic sequencing reads mapped to the human genome, were significantly elevated in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients; HDC correlated with microbial- and metabolic-pathway-biomarkers of CRC, and was the most important contributor to patient stratification. We found similar results in Crohn's disease (CD); additionally, patients treated with diet and drug intervention showed reduced HDC levels over time, and were accompanied by reversing changes of many CD-signature species. Our results suggested that host-derived contents may have greater impact on gut microbiota than previously anticipated, and CIB could be an ideal treatment target that could reverse dysbiosis globally and precisely.","Jiang, P.; Lai, S.; Wu, S.; Yin, X.; Zhang, J.; Zhao, X.-M.; Xu, S.-Q.; Chen, W.",20191129,"Gastroenterology","10.1101/19011833",1,"Weihua Chen","Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19011833v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19011833v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"all data are publicly available. the corresponding links to public database have been included in the manuscript."
737,"Posttraumatic stress disorder is associated with alpha dysrhythmia across the visual cortex and the default mode network","Background: Anomalies in default mode network (DMN) activity and alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations have been independently observed in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Recent spatiotemporal analyses suggest that alpha oscillations support DMN functioning via inter-regional synchronization and sensory cortical inhibition. Therefore, we examined a unifying pathology of alpha deficits in the visual-cortex-DMN system in PTSD. Methods: Patients with PTSD (N = 25) and two control groups - patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (N = 24) and healthy controls (N = 20) - underwent a standard eyes-open resting state (S-RS) and a modified resting state (M-RS) of passively viewing salient images (known to deactivate the DMN). High-density electroencephalogram (hdEEG) were recorded, from which intracortical alpha activity (power and connectivity/Granger causality) was extracted using the exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA). Results: Patients with PTSD (vs. controls) demonstrated attenuated alpha power in the visual cortex and key hubs of the DMN (posterior cingulate cortex/PCC and medial prefrontal cortex/mPFC) at both states, the severity of which further correlated with hypervigilance symptoms. With increased visual input (at M-RS vs. S-RS), patients with PTSD further demonstrated reduced alpha-frequency directed connectivity within the DMN (PCC to mPFC) and, importantly, from the visual cortex (VC) to both DMN hubs (VC to PCC and VC to mPFC), linking alpha deficits in the two systems. Conclusions: These interrelated alpha deficits align with DMN hypoactivity/hypoconnectivity, sensory disinhibition, and hypervigilance in PTSD, representing a unifying neural underpinning of these anomalies. The identification of visual-cortex-DMN alpha dysrhythmia in PTSD further presents a novel therapeutic target, promoting network-based intervention of neural oscillations.","Clancy, K.

772,"Closed Loop Deep Brain Stimulation for Freezing of Gait","Freezing of gait (FOG), a devastating symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), can be refractory to current treatments such as medication and open-loop deep brain stimulation (olDBS). Recent evidence suggests that closed-loop DBS (clDBS), using beta local field potential power from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) as the control variable, can improve tremor and bradykinesia; however, no study has investigated the use of clDBS for the treatment of FOG. In this study, we provide preliminary evidence that clDBS was superior to olDBS in reducing percent time freezing and in reducing freezing behavior (gait arrhythmicity) in a person with PD and FOG. These findings warrant further investigation into the use of clDBS to treat FOG while also minimizing the total energy delivered to maintain a therapeutic effect.","Petrucci, M. N.; Neuville, R.

725,"Prevalence of erectile dysfunction patients with diabetes mellitus and its association with body mass index and glycated hemoglobin in Africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: Mortality and morbidity in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) is attributed to both the micro vascular and macro vascular complications. Variation among primary studies was seen on the prevalence of erectile dysfunction in Africa. Therefore this study was aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of erectile dysfunction patients with diabetes mellitus and its association with body mass index and glycated hemoglobin in Africa. Methods: PubMed Web of Science Cochrane library Scopus Psyinfo Africa online journal and Google Scholar were searched. A funnel plot and Egger s regression test were used to see publication bias. I squared statistic was used to check heterogeneity of studies. DerSimonian and Laird random effects model was applied to estimate the pooled effect size. The subgroup and Meta regression analysis were conducted by country sample size and year of publication. Sensitivity analysis was deployed to see the effect of single study on the overall estimation. STATA version 14 statistical software was used for meta analysis. Result: A total of 20 studies with 5 177 study participants were included to estimate the pooled prevalence. The pooled prevalence of erectile dysfunction patients with diabetes mellitus was 61.62% (95% CI: 48.35, 74.9). BMI greater than or equal to 30kg/m2 (AOR = 1.26; 95% CI: 0.73, 2.16) and glycated hemoglobin greater than or equal to 7%(AOR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.5, 5.9) were identified factors though not statistically significant associated with erectile dysfunction. Conclusions: The prevalence of erectile dysfunction in Africa remains high. Therefore, situation based interventions and country context specific preventive strategies could be developed to reduce the magnitude of erectile dysfunction among patients with diabetes mellitus.

742,"Early Intervention in preterm infants modulates LINE-1 promoter methylation and neurodevelopment","Background: Early life adversity exposure impacts preterm infants neurodevelopment and early intervention protocols may modulate neurodevelopmental outcomes. Neuronal genomes are plastic in response to environment and mobile genetic elements, including LINE-1 (L1), are source of brain genomic mosaicism. Maternal care during early life regulates L1 methylation and copy number variations (CNVs) in mice. Here, we sought to identify the effects of maternal care and positive multisensory stimulation (Early Intervention) on L1 methylation and neurodevelopment in preterm infants. Methods: Very preterm infants were randomized to receive Standard Care or Early Intervention. L1 methylation was measured at birth and at hospital discharge. At 12 months infants neurodevelopment was evaluated with the Griffiths Scales. L1 methylation and CNVs were measured in mouse brain areas at embryonic and postnatal stages. Results: We demonstrated that L1 is hypomethylated in preterm versus term infants at birth. Early Intervention contributes to restore L1 methylation and positively modulates neurodevelopment. We showed that L1 methylation is developmentally-regulated in mice, decreasing in early postnatal life stages, which turns into an increased L1 CNVs specifically in hippocampus and cortex. Conclusions: Here we demonstrated that L1 dynamics can be modulated by Early Intervention, in parallel with ameliorated neurodevelopmental outcomes. We further identified a specific developmental window of the fetal mouse brain, sensitive to early life experience, in which L1 dynamics are fine-tuned contributing to shape the brain genomic landscape.","Fontana, C.; Marasca, F.; Provitera, L.; Mancinelli, S.; Pesenti, N.; Sinha, S.; Passera, S.; Abrignani, S.; Mosca, F.; Lodato, S.; Bodega, B.; Fumagalli, M.",20191115,"Pediatrics","10.1101/19011874",1,"Beatrice Bodega","Istituto Nazionale di Genetica Molecolare Enrica e Romeo Invernizzi (INGM), Milan, Italy","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19011874v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19011874v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"Data available upon request."
826,"Neurofilaments as blood biomarkers at the preataxic and ataxic stage of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3: a cross-species analysis in humans and mice","Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a devastating multisystemic neurodegenerative disease for which targeted molecular therapies are coming into reach (e.g. antisense oligonucleotides). To pave the way for upcoming translational trials, easily accessible biomarkers in SCA3 are needed, particularly for subjects at the preataxic stage and cross-validated also in animal models. We hypothesised that serum neurofilaments might serve as blood biomarkers of disease progression in both human SCA3 and mouse models, expecting increased concentrations already at the preataxic stage. Serum neurofilament light (NfL) and phosphorylated neurofilament heavy (pNfH) levels were determined by ultra-sensitive single molecule array (Simoa) in cross-sectional samples of ataxic and preataxic SCA3 subjects and controls in two independent cohorts (ESMI cohort = cohort #1: n=160, EuroSCA/RiSCA cohort = cohort #2: n=89). Serum NfL and pNfH were also assessed in a 304Q SCA3 knock-in mouse model across presymptomatic and symptomatic disease stages (n=147). Ataxic SCA3 subjects showed increased serum NfL (p<0.001) and pNfH (p<0.001) levels in cohort #1, with NfL levels already increased in preataxic subjects (p<0.001). All these results were replicated in cohort #2 (all p<0.001). Cross-sectional NfL levels correlated with clinical disease severity (Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia [SARA]; r=0.43, p<0.001) and with longitudinal disease progression (annual SARA score change, {varrho}=0.42, p=0.012). CAG count and age were significant predictors of individual NfL concentrations (each p<0.001). NfL levels in preataxic subjects increased with proximity to individual expected onset of ataxia (p<0.001), with significant elevations already 7.5 years before onset. Serum NfL and pNfH increases in SCA3 subjects were paralleled by similar changes in SCA3 knock-in mice, here also already starting at the presymptomatic stage and close to the onset of ataxin-3 protein increase. Serum concentrations of neurofilaments, particularly NfL, might provide easily accessible biomarkers of disease severity in both ataxic and preataxic SCA3 subjects and mice prior to conversion. Neurofilaments thus entail potential applications as progression, onset/proximity and treatment-response markers in both human and murine SCA3 trials.","Wilke, C.; Haas, E.; Reetz, K.; Faber, J.; Garcia-Moreno, H.; Santana, M.

In this study, we present IE-Map, an in-vivo template and atlas of all known substructures of the human labyrinth derived from multi-modal high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging data in a non-invasive manner (no contrast agent or radiation). We reconstructed a common template from 126 inner ears (63 normal subjects) and annotated it with 94 established landmarks and semi-automatic segmentations. Quantitative substructure analysis revealed a correlation of labyrinth parameters with total intracranial volume. No effects of gender or laterality were found.

Residents acknowledge the importance of high-value, cost-conscious care-delivery, yet perceive training to be insufficient. We designed an observational study to gain insight into how the workplace setting relates to residents high-value, cost-conscious care-delivery. Design: This ethnographic study builds on 175 hours of non-participant observations including informal interviews, 9 semi-structured interviews and document analysis. Setting: Department of obstetrics and gynaecology in an academic hospital in the Netherlands. Population or sample: 21 gynaecology residents. Methods: Iterative analysis process of fieldnotes, interview transcripts and documents, including open-coding, thematic analysis and axial analysis by a multidisciplinary research team. Results: Residents rarely consider health care costs, and knowledge regarding costs is often absent. Senior consultants guide residents while balancing benefits, risks and costs, with or without explicating their decision-making process. Identified learning opportunities are elaboration on questions raised concerning high-value, cost-conscious care, checking information about costs that are used in discussions about high-value, cost-conscious care, and having a more open and explicit discussion about high-value, cost-conscious care. Conclusion: Our study emphasizes that the opportunities and potential to train residents to deliver high-value, cost-conscious care in the workplace are present. The challenge resides in capitalizing on these opportunities. We suggest departments to consult external experts to facilitate discussions regarding high-value, cost-conscious care to contribute to informal learning and to create a workplace setting in which high-value, cost-conscious care-delivery is prioritized.

846,"Population based targeted sequencing of 54 candidate genes identifies PALB2 as a susceptibility gene for high grade serous ovarian cancer","Purpose: The known EOC susceptibility genes account for less than 50% of the heritable risk of ovarian cancer suggesting other susceptibility genes exist. The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution to ovarian cancer susceptibility of rare deleterious germline variants in a set of candidate genes. Methods: We sequenced the coding region of 54 candidate genes in 6385 invasive EOC cases and 6115 controls of broad European ancestry. Genes with an increased frequency of putative deleterious variants in cases verses controls were further examined in an independent set of 14,146 EOC cases and 28,661 controls from the ovarian cancer association consortium and the UK Biobank. For each gene, we estimated the EOC risks and evaluated associations between germline variant status and clinical characteristics. Results: The odds ratios (OR) associated for high-grade serous ovarian cancer were 3.01 for PALB2 (95% CI 1.59-5.68; P = 0.00068), 1.99 for POLK (95% CI 1.15-3.43; P = 0.014), and 4.07 for SLX4 (95% CI 1.34-12.4; P = 0.013). Deleterious mutations in FBXO10 were associated with a reduced risk of disease (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.07-1.00, P=0.049). However, based on the Bayes false discovery probability, only the association for PALB2 in high-grade serous ovarian cancer is likely to represent a true positive. Conclusions: We have found strong evidence that carriers of PALB2 deleterious mutations are at increased risk of high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Whether the magnitude of risk is sufficiently high to warrant the inclusion of PALB2 in cancer gene panels for ovarian cancer risk testing is unclear; much larger sample sizes will be needed to provide sufficiently precise estimates for clinical counselling.","Song, H.; Ramus, S.; Dicks, E.; Tyrer, J.; Intermaggio, M.; Chenevix-Trench, G.; Bowtell, D.; Traficante, N.; Brenton, J.; Goranova, T.; Hosking, K.; Piskorz, A.; Van Oudenhove, E.; Doherty, J.; Harris, H.

746,"Rapid identification of genomic structural variations with nanopore sequencing enables blood-based cancer monitoring","Somatic genomic structural variations (SVs) are promising personalized biomarkers for sensitive and specific detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in liquid biopsies. However, affordable and fast identification of such SV biomarkers is challenging, which hinders routine use in the clinic. Here, we developed a novel approach - termed SHARC - for rapid discovery of somatic SVs as personalized tumor biomarkers. SHARC combines low coverage cancer genome sketching by using Oxford Nanopore sequencing with random forest classification and a dedicated filtering pipeline to enrich for somatic SVs. Our method leverages the real-time and long-read capabilities of nanopore sequencing to identify somatic SV breakpoints at nucleotide resolution from a tumor tissue biopsy within three days. We applied SHARC to tumor samples of high-grade ovarian and prostate cancer and validated on average ten somatic SVs per sample with PCR mini-amplicons. An accompanying method for SV breakpoint detection from liquid biopsies was devised based on digital PCR, enabling detection of cancer in a quantitative manner. Using this method, we retrospectively monitored treatment response in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Our work demonstrates that SHARC forms a universal framework for rapid development of personalized biomarker assays for blood-based monitoring of any cancer type.","Espejo Valle-Inclan, J.; Stangl, C.; De Jong, A.

Results: A total of 2,575,411 prescriptions were issued in 2018 for ciclosporin, tacrolimus and diltiazem (over 60mg); of these, 316,119 prescriptions breached NHS guidance (12.3%). Breaches were most common amongst users of the EMIS EHR (in 23.2% of ciclosporin & tacrolimus prescriptions, and 22.7% of diltiazem prescriptions); but breaches were observed in all EHRs. Conclusion: Design choices in EHR strongly influence safe prescribing of ciclosporin, tacrolimus and diltiazem; and breaches are prevalent in general practices in England. We recommend that all EHR vendors review their systems to increase safe prescribing of these medicines in line with national guidance. Almost all clinical practice is now mediated through an EHR system: further quantitative research into the effect of EHR design on clinical practice is long overdue.","Mackenna, B.; Bacon, S.; Walker, A.

1025,"Dengue Epidemiology in a Brazilian Community","Dengue is a major vector-borne disease and has motivated health surveillance systems to implement various measures to control it. The epidemiological characterization of dengue occurrence in a community is an important step to foster control activities. We carried out an epidemiological study of the notified and confirmed cases of dengue, from 2000 to 2005, in Guarulhos, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. A statistical analysis was performed to test the differences, by sex and age, between the database and the individuals of the population. We also performed a time series analysis of the cases from 2000 to 2007. No statistically significant differences (P>0.05) were observed between the proportions for each sex in the data base and in the city population, and in the categories of 15-19 years, 20-24 years, 25-29 years, 55-59 years, 60-64 years and 70-74 years when compared with the corresponding age intervals in the population. In the other age intervals, statistically significant differences were observed (P<0.05). We observed a cyclic variation in the dengue incidence, between 2000 and 2007, with an alternation of two years with a smaller number of cases (2000-2001 and 2004-2005) and two years with a larger number of cases (2002-2003 and 2006-2007). In the seasonality analysis, the number of cases between February and May was higher than the monthly average. Analyzing the spatial distribution of the cases, we observed the process of increasing endemicity of dengue.","Mansho, W.; Ferreira, F.; Kakitani, I.; Azevedo, R.

750,"The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in -thalassemia patients in Pakistan: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Objective: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most commonly reported bloodborne infection in Pakistan. Frequent blood transfusions in {beta}-thalassemia patients expose them to a high risk of HCV infection. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the current data on the prevalence of HCV infection among {beta}-thalassemia patients in Pakistan by using a systematic review and meta-analysis. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Participants: {beta}-thalassemia patients in Pakistan. Data sources: Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search in PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed to identify published articles reporting on the prevalence of HCV among {beta}-thalassemia patients in Pakistan. Only English language articles were considered. Two independent authors selected studies. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Results: The search conceded a total of 138 studies, of which 27 studies were finally considered for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of HCV in {beta}-thalassemia patients in Pakistan was 36.21% (95% CI: 28.98-43.75%) based on 5,789 {beta}-thalassemia patients, but there was considerable heterogeneity. Meta-analysis estimated the HCV prevalence among the {beta}-thalassemia patients at 45.98 % (95% CI: 38.15-53.90%) in Punjab, 31.81% (95% CI: 20.27-44.59%) in Sindh, and 28.04% (95% CI: 13.58-45.26%) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Meta-regression analysis showed that geographical location was a key source of heterogeneity. Conclusions: The pooled prevalence of hepatitis C virus among {beta}-thalassemia patients in Pakistan was 36.21%, but varies regionally within the country. The prevalence is higher than in neighboring countries. With the use of standard prevention procedures during blood transfusion, the risk of HCV transmission among {beta}-thalassemia patients could be controlled hence prevalence of HCV in {beta}-thalassemia patients could be reduced.","Akhtar, S.; Nasir, J.

749,"Mutation prevalence tables for hereditary cancer derived from multi-gene panel testing","Purpose: Multi-gene panel testing for cancer predisposition mutations is becoming routine in clinical care. However, the gene content of panels offered by testing laboratories vary significantly, and data on mutation detection rates by gene and by panel is limited, causing confusion among clinicians on which test would be the most appropriate to order. Moreover, screening guidelines are not described in sufficient granularity to explain how differences in family, personal history, age, and other factors would affect the prevalence of finding a mutation in similar populations. The tool herein quantifies prevalence of mutations in hereditary cancer genes based on personalized clinical and demographic characteristics. Methods: Using results from approximately 150,000 multi-gene panel tests conducted at Ambry Genetics, we built an interactive prevalence tool to explore how differences in ethnicity, age of onset, and personal and family history of different cancers affect the prevalence of pathogenic mutations in 31 cancer predisposition genes, across various clinically available hereditary cancer gene panels. Results: Over 13,000 mutation carriers were identified in this high-risk population. Most of the cases were Non-Hispanic White (74%, n=109,537), but also provide an appreciable dataset for those identifying as Black (n=10,875), Ashkenazi Jewish (n=10,464), Hispanic (n=10,028), and Asian (n=7,090). The most prevalent cancer types were breast (50%), ovarian (6.6%), and colorectal (4.7%), which is expected based on genetic testing guidelines and clinician referral for testing. Conclusion: The Hereditary Cancer Multi-Gene Panel Prevalence Tool presented here can be used to provide insight into the prevalence of mutations on a per-gene and per-multigene panel basis, while conditioning on multiple custom phenotypic variables to include race and cancer type.

748,"Genetic variation near CXCL12 is associated with susceptibility to HIV-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma","Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with a substantially increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). High plasma viral load, low CD4+ T cell counts and absence of antiretroviral treatment (ART) are known predictive factors for NHL. Even in the era of suppressive ART, HIV-infected individuals remain at increased risk of developing NHL compared to the general population. To search for human genetic determinants of HIV-associated NHL, we performed case-control genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in three cohorts of HIV+ patients of European ancestry and meta-analyzed the results. In total, 278 cases and 1924 matched controls were included. We observed a significant association with NHL susceptibility in the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) region on chromosome 10. A fine mapping analysis identified rs7919208 as the most likely causal variant (P = 4.77e-11). The G>A polymorphism creates a new transcription factor binding site for BATF and JUND. Analyses of topologically associating domains and promoter capture Hi-C data revealed significant interactions between the rs7919208 region and the promoter of CXCL12, also known as stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF-1). These results suggest a modulatory role of CXCL12 regulation in the increased susceptibility to NHL observed in the HIV-infected population.","Thorball, C.

743,"The efficacy of DNA MMR enzyme immunohistochemistry as a screening test for hypermutated gliomas","A subset of gliomas has DNA repair defects that lead to hypermutated genomes. While such tumors are resistant to alkylating chemotherapies, they may also express more mutant neoantigens on their cell surfaces, and thus be more responsive to immunotherapies. A fast, inexpensive method of screening for hypermutated gliomas would therefore be of great clinical value. Since immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins Msh2, Msh6, Mlh1, and Pms2 is already used to screen for hypermutated colorectal cancers, we sought to determine whether that panel might have similar utility in gliomas. MMR IHC was scored in 100 WHO grade I-IV gliomas with known tumor mutation burdens (TMB), while blinded to TMB data. Eight of 100 cases showed loss of one or more MMR proteins by IHC, and all 8 were hypermutated. Among the remaining 94 gliomas with intact MMR IHC, only one was hypermutated; that tumor had an inactivating mutation in another DNA repair gene, ATM. Overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 99%, 89%, and 100%, respectively. The strongest correlates with hypermutation were prior TMZ treatment, MGMT promoter methylation, and IDH1 mutation. Among MMR-deficient hypermutated gliomas, 50% contained both MMR-lost and MMR-retained tumor cells. Together, these data suggest that MMR IHC could be a viable front-line screening test for gliomas in which immunotherapy is being considered. They also suggest that not all cells in a hypermutated glioma may actually be MMR-deficient, a finding that might need to be considered when treating such tumors with immunotherapies.","Mccord, M.; Steffens, A.; Javier, R.; Kam, K.-L.; Mccortney, K.; Horbinski, C.",20191115,"Pathology","10.1101/19012005",1,"Craig Horbinski","Northwestern University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012005v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012005v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"No genomic or other publicly available datasets exist in this manuscript."
754,"Mitochondrial DNA copy number and incident heart failure: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study","Background: The association between mitochondrial DNA-copy number (mtDNA-CN) and incident heart failure (HF) in the general population is unclear. Methods: We examined the association between mtDNA-CN and the risk of incident HF among 10,802 participants free of HF at baseline from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, a large bi-racial population-based cohort. mtDNA-CN was estimated using probe intensities on the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human single nucleotide polymorphisms Array 6.0. Incident HF events were identified through hospital discharge codes from 1987 until 2005 and through adjudication by the ARIC HF Classification Committee since 2005. Results: During a median follow-up of 23.1 years, there were 2,227 incident HF events (incidence rate 10.3 per 1000 person-years). In fully adjusted models, the hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for HF comparing the 2nd through 5th quintiles of mtDNA-CN to the 1st quintile were 0.91 (0.80-1.04), 0.82 (0.72-0.93), 0.81 (0.71-0.92), and 0.74 (0.65-0.85), respectively (P for trend < 0.001). In stratified analyses, the associations between mtDNA-CN and HF were similar across examined subgroups. The inverse association between mtDNA-CN and incident HF was stronger in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) than in HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Conclusions: In this prospective cohort, mtDNA-CN was inversely associated with the risk of incident HF suggesting that reduced levels of mtDNA-CN, a biomarker of mitochondrial dysfunction, could reflect early susceptibility to HF.","Hong, Y.

747,"Common variants in Alzheimer's disease: Novel association of six genetic variants with AD and risk stratification by polygenic risk scores","BACKGROUND: Disentangling the genetic constellation underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important. Doing so allows us to identify biological pathways underlying AD, point towards novel drug targets and use the variants for individualised risk predictions in disease modifying or prevention trials. In the present work we report on the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) for AD risk to date and show the combined utility of proven AD loci for precision medicine using polygenic risk scores (PRS). METHODS: Three sets of summary statistics were included in our meta-GWAS of AD: an Spanish case-control study (GR@ACE/DEGESCO study, n = 12,386), the case-control study of International Genomics of Alzheimer project (IGAP, n = 82,771) and the UK Biobank (UKB) AD-by-proxy case-control study (n=314,278). Using these resources, we performed a fixed-effects inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis. Detected loci were confirmed in a replication study of 19,089 AD cases and 39,101 controls from 16 European-ancestry cohorts not previously used. We constructed a weighted PRS based on the 39 AD variants. PRS were generated by multiplying the genotype dosage of each risk allele for each variant by its respective weight, and then summing across all variants. We first validated it for AD in independent data (assessing effects of sub-threshold signal, diagnostic certainty, age at onset and sex) and tested its effect on risk (odds for disease) and age at onset in the GR@ACE/DEGESCO study. FINDINGS: Using our meta-GWAS approach and follow-up analysis, we identified novel genome-wide significant associations of six genetic variants with AD risk (rs72835061-CHRNE, rs2154481-APP, rs876461-PRKD3/NDUFAF7, rs3935877-PLCG2 and two missense variants: rs34173062/rs34674752 in SHARPIN gene) and confirmed a stop codon mutation in the IL34 gene increasing the risk of AD (IL34-Tyr213Ter), and two other variants in PLCG2 and HS3ST1 regions. This brings the total number of genetic variants associated with AD to 39 (excluding APOE). The PRS based on these variants was associated with AD in an independent clinical AD-case control dataset (OR=1.30, per 1-SD increase in the PRS, 95%CI 1.18-1.44, p = 1.1x10-7), a similar effect to that in the GR@ACE/DEGESCO (OR=1.27, 95%CI 1.23-1.32, p = 7.4x10-39). We then explored the combined effects of these 39 variants in a PRS for AD risk and age-at-onset stratification in GR@ACE/DEGESCO. Excluding APOE, we observed a gradual risk increase over the 2% tiles; when comparing the extremes, those with the 2% highest risk had a 2.98-fold (95% CI 2.12-4.18, p = 3.2x10-10) increased risk compared to those with the 2% lowest risk (p = 5.9x10-10). Using the PRS we identified APOE {varepsilon}33 carriers with a similar risk as APOE {varepsilon}4 heterozygotes carriers, as well as APOE {varepsilon}4 heterozygote carriers with a similar risk as APOE {varepsilon}4 homozygote. Considering age at onset; there was a 9-year difference between median onset of AD the lowest risk group and the highest risk group (82 vs 73 years; p = 1.6x10-6); a 4-year median onset difference (81 vs 77 years; p = 6.9x10-5) within APOE {varepsilon}4 heterozygotes and a 5.5-year median onset difference (78.5 vs 73 years; p = 4.6x10-5) within APOE {varepsilon}4 carriers. INTERPRETATION: We identified six novel genetic variants associated with AD-risk, among which one common APP variant. A PRS of all genetic loci reported to date could be a robust tool to predict the risk and age at onset of AD, beyond APOE alone. These properties make PRS instrumental in selecting individuals at risk in order to apply preventative strategies and might have potential use in diagnostic work-up.","De Rojas, I.; Moreno-Grau, S.; Tesi, N.; Grenier-Boley, B.; Andrade, V.; Jansen, I.; Pedersen, N.

780,"Creatine Kinase is Associated with Bleeding after Myocardial Infarction","Background: Highly elevated plasma activity of the ADP scavenging enzyme creatine kinase (CK) might reduce ADP and ADP-dependent platelet activation. Therefore, we studied, whether high CK after myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with bleeding. Method: Data of the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction Study Group phase II trial on the efficacy of angioplasty following intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), are used to assess whether peak plasma CK (CKmax) is independently associated with adjudicated fatal or non-fatal bleeding (primary) and combined bleeding/all-cause mortality (secondary) in multivariable binomial logistic regression analysis, adjusting for baseline and treatment allocation covariates. Results: The included patients (N=3339, 82% men, 88% white, mean age 57 y, SE 0.2), had a history of angina pectoris (55%), hypertension (38%), and/or diabetes mellitus (13%). CKmax ranged between 16 and 55 890 IU/L (mean 2389 IU/L; SE 41), reached within 8 h in 51% of the patients (93% within 24 h). Adjudicated fatal/non-fatal bleeding occurred in 30% of the patients (respectively 26% in the low vs 34% in the high CK tertile), and bleeding/all-cause mortality in 35% (29% in the low, vs 40% in the high CK tertile). The adjusted odds ratio for fatal/non-fatal bleeding (vs not bleeding and survival) was 2.6 [95% CI, 1.8 to 3.7]/log CKmax increase, and 3.1 [2.2 to 4.4] for bleeding/all-cause mortality). Conclusion: Highly elevated plasma CK after MI might be a hitherto overlooked independent indicator of bleeding and hemorrhagic death. This biologically plausible association warrants prospective study of the potential role of CK in hemorrhagic diathesis, and the risk of severe, potentially fatal bleeding with antithrombotic or thrombolytic therapy in the presence of high plasma CK.","Brewster, L.; Fernand, J.",20191119,"Cardiovascular Medicine","10.1101/19012039",1,"L Brewster","CK Science Foundation","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012039v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012039v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"https://biolincc.nhlbi.nih.gov/"

Self-medication is a growing public health phenomenon and is associated with risks such as misdiagnosis and drug toxicity. This study aimed to identify the patterns associated with the practice of self-medication among university students in San Jose, Costa Rica. A descriptive cross-sectional study was designed and conducted to identify variables associated. Information was collected on the conditions treated, medications used, and their sources. The study found that self-medication is highly prevalent among Costa Rican university students. 91.4% of the sample reported self-medicating, with each student consuming an average of 2.15, {+/-} 1,08 drugs. The prevalence found is higher than that reported in previous studies conducted in the country.

Objective: To develop and internally validate a prognostic model to predict individual indirect (non-contact) muscle injury (IMI) risk during a season in elite footballers, only using PHE-derived candidate prognostic factors. Methods: Routinely collected preseason PHE and injury data were used from 119 players over 5 seasons (1st July 2013 to 19th May 2018). Ten candidate prognostic factors (12 parameters) were included in model development. Multiple imputation was used to handle missing values. The outcome was any time-loss, index indirect muscle injury (I-IMI) affecting the lower extremity. A full logistic regression model was fitted, and a parsimonious model developed using backward-selection to remove non-significant factors. Predictive performance was assessed through calibration, discrimination and decision-curve analysis, averaged across all imputed datasets. The model was internally validated using bootstrapping and adjusted for overfitting. Results: During 317 participant-seasons, 138 I-IMIs were recorded. The parsimonious model included only age and frequency of previous IMIs; apparent calibration was perfect but discrimination was modest (C-index = 0.641, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.580 to 0.703), with clinical utility evident between risk thresholds of 37-71%. After validation and overfitting adjustment, performance deteriorated (C-index = 0.580; calibration-in-the-large = -0.031, calibration slope =0.663). Conclusion: The selected PHE data were insufficient prognostic factors from which to develop a useful model for predicting IMI risk in elite footballers. Further research should prioritise identifying novel prognostic factors to improve future risk prediction models in this field.","Hughes, T.; Riley, R.; Callaghan, M. J.; Sergeant, J.

This study sought to determine whether vitamin D levels are associated with the severity of tics and presence and severity of comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methods: This is a cross-sectional sub-study of the European Multicentre Tics in Children Studies (EMTICS). Vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels (ng/ml) were obtained for 327 participants with CTD at study entry and tic severity was measured using the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS). An association between tic severity and presence and severity of comorbid OCD and/or ADHD symptoms was analysed using multilevel models controlling for season, site, sex, age and presence of comorbid OCD and/or ADHD. Results: The participants comprised 247 boys and 80 girls (4-16 years, mean [SD], 10.9 [2.72]). Hypovitaminosis-D ([25(OH)D] < 20ng/ml) was present in 33% of participants with CTD and/ or comorbid OCD and/ or ADHD. The authors found no association between 25(OH)D levels and tic severity or OCD symptom severity.

753,"Evidence linking atopy and staphylococcal superantigens to the pathogenesis of lymphomatoid papulosis, a recurrent CD30+ cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorder","Background: Lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) is a self-healing CD30+ cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorder (CLPD) with paradoxical histology of a malignant lymphoma. Case reports and small patient series suggest an association of LyP with atopy. However, the prevalence of atopy depends on patient recall which is not always reliable. More objective criteria of atopy include skin reactivity to allergens and IgE reactivity to allergens. This study was undertaken to determine if atopy is prevalent in LyP patients using IgE specific antibodies to aeroallergens, and if Staphylococcal aureus enterotoxins might be a pathogenic factors for LyP as proposed for other skin disorders. Methods: Thirty-one samples of patients with CD30+ CLPD were tested for total serum IgE (IgE-t) and 10 IgE-specific airborne allergens with the Phadiatop multiallergen test, which if positive, is regarded as evidence of atopy. Sera was tested for IgE reactive against three Staphylococcal enterotoxins with superantigenic properties (SSAg-IgE). Control sera were obtained from adult subjects evaluated for rhino-sinusitis and a negative Phadiatop test. Patient history of atopy was obtained by retrospective chart review. Findings: Nearly 50% of LyP patients had a positive Phadiatop test and IgE-t was increased compared to non-atopic controls. Seven of 28 (25%) LyP patients had at least one SSAg-IgE at the concentration used to define serologic atopy (0.35 kUa/L) compared to 3/52 (6%) controls (P= 0.028). TSST1-IgE was detected in 7 (23%) specimens of CD30CLPD, often together with SEB-IgE; SEA-IgE was not detected. TSST1-IgE exceeded the 0.35 kUa/L threshold in 3 (6%) controls. Conclusions: LyP patients have an increased prevalence of atopy as determined by the Phadiatop test and increased prevalence of SSAg-IgE compared to controls. Prevalence of serologic atopy exceeded that reported by patient medical history. The results support the hypothesis that an atopic diathesis and possibly SSAg contribute to the pathogenesis of LyP.","Kadin, M. E.; Hamilton, R. C.; Vonderheid, E.

751,"Genome-wide association study of Buruli ulcer in rural Benin","Buruli ulcer, caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is the third mycobacterial disease worldwide characterized by devastating necrotizing skin lesions. The role of host genetics in susceptibility to Buruli ulcer has long been suggested. We conduct the first genome-wide association study of Buruli ulcer on a combined sample of 1,524 well characterized patients and controls from rural Benin. Two-stage analyses identify two novel associated loci located within lincRNA genes: rs9814705 in ENSG00000240095.1 (P = 2.85x10-7; odds ratio = 1.80 [1.43-2.27]), and rs76647377 in LINC01622 (P = 9.85x10-8; hazard ratio = 0.41 [0.28-0.60]). Furthermore, we replicate the protective effect of allele G of a missense variant located in ATG16L1, and previously shown to decrease bacterial autophagy (rs2241880, P = 0.003; odds ratio = 0.31 [0.14-0.68]).

728,"Is There a Health Inequality in Gambling Related Harms? A Systematic Review","Objective: Here we present a systematic review of the existing research into gambling harms, in order to determine whether there are differences in the presentation of these across demographic groups such as age, gender, culture, and socioeconomic status, or gambling behaviour categories such as risk severity and play frequency. Primary and Secondary Outcome Measures: Inclusion criteria were: 1) focus on gambling harms; 2) focus on harms to the gambler rather than affected others; 3) discussion of specific listed harms and not just harms in general terms. Exclusion criteria were: 1) not written in English; 2) not an empirical study (i.e. an editorial piece or letter); 3) not available as a full article. Search: A systematic search was conducted using the Web of Science database in August 2019. Selected studies were assessed for quality using Standard Quality Assessment Criteria. Results: Forty-Seven studies published between 2006 and 2019 met the inclusion criteria. These were categorised into thematic groups for comparison and discussion. There were replicated differences found in groups defined by age, risk severity and gambling behaviours. However, the majority of research regarding gender concluded that harm profiles were similar, or differences could be explained by confounding variables. Conclusion: Harms appear to be dependent on specific social, demographic and environmental conditions that suggests there is a health inequality in gambling related harms. Further investigation is required to develop standardised measurement tools and to understand confounding variables and co-morbidities. With a robust understanding of harms distribution in the population, Primary Care Workers will be better equipped to identify those who are at risk, or who are showing signs of Gambling Disorder, and to target prevention and intervention programmes appropriately.","Raybould, J.; Larkin, M.; Tunney, R.

764,"Behavioral effects of multiple-dose oxytocin treatment in autism: A randomized, placebo-controlled trial with long-term follow-up","Background Intranasal administration of the prosocial neuropeptide oxytocin is increasingly explored as a potential treatment for targeting the core characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, long-term follow-up studies, evaluating the possibility of long-lasting retention effects are currently lacking. Methods Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design, this pilot clinical trial explored the possibility of long-lasting behavioral effects of four weeks of intranasal oxytocin treatment (24 International Units once daily in the morning) in 40 adult men with ASD. To do so, self-report and informant-based questionnaires assessing core autism symptoms and characterizations of attachment were administered at baseline, immediately after four weeks of treatment (approximately 24 hours after the last nasal spray administration), and at two follow-up sessions, four weeks and one year post-treatment. Results No treatment-specific effects were identified in the primary outcome assessing social symptoms (Social responsiveness scale, self- and informant-rated). In particular, with respect to self-reported social responsiveness, improvements were evident both in the oxytocin and in the placebo group, yielding no significant between-group difference (p= .37). Also informant-rated improvements in social responsiveness were not significantly larger in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group (between-group difference: p= .19). Among the secondary outcome measures, treatment-specific improvements were identified in the Repetitive Behavior Scale and State Adult Attachment Measure, indicating reductions in self-reported repetitive behaviours (p= .04) and reduced feelings of avoidance towards others (p= .03) in the oxytocin group compared to the placebo group, up to one month and even one year post-treatment. Treatment-specific effects were also revealed in screenings of mood states (Profile of Mood States), indicating higher reports of vigor (feeling energetic, active, lively) in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group (p= .03). Conclusions While no treatment-specific improvements were evident in terms of core social symptoms, the current observations of long-term beneficial effects on repetitive behaviors and feelings of avoidance are promising and suggestive of a therapeutic potential of oxytocin treatment for ASD. However, given the exploratory nature of this pilot study, future studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term effects of OT administration further.","Bernaerts, S.; Boets, B.; Bosmans, G.; Steyaert, J.; Alaerts, K.",20191118,"Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology","10.1101/19012112",1,"Kaat Alaerts","KU Leuven","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012112v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012112v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd","10.1186/s13229-020-0313-1","Data available upon request."
810,"Phylodynamics of pertussis in the vaccine era: transition to re-emergence","Bordetella pertussis causes whooping cough in humans. Despite high routine vaccination coverage, pertussis has become the most prevalent vaccine-preventable disease in many industrialized countries, since the 1990s. While a plethora of candidate explanations for the resurgence remain hotly debated, two prevailing ideas focus on vaccine driven pathogen adaptation and on the switch to the latest generation vaccines. We use a suite of genomic and epidemiological approaches to characterize pertussis transmission in the Netherlands, between 1949 and 2017, investigate drivers of B. pertussis population diversity, and the role of allele shifts in the resurgence. Reconciling the epidemiological data with sequence data has allowed us to characterize a resurgence that is not accompanied with increased transmission but has unique functional genomic signatures of decreased diversity. Here we show a positive association between genetic diversity and incidence which validates the hypothesis that the resurgence is associated with the expansion of more pathogenic strains. We see a direct effect of vaccination on the replicative fitness of pathogens. Our models suggest, large outbreaks are unlikely to be due to immune evasion and the vaccine switch cannot be contributing to increased pertussis incidence. Therefore, efforts aimed at mitigating the resurgence in the population at large, and particularly in vulnerable infants, are more likely to succeed by maintaining routine vaccine coverage high.","Bento, A.

843,"Obstetrical safety indicators for preventing hospital harms: a scoping review protocol","Introduction: Optimizing the safety of obstetric patient care is a primary concern for many hospitals. Identifying performance indicators that measure aspects of patient care processes related to preventable harms can present opportunities to improve health systems. In this paper, we present our protocol for a scoping review to identify performance indicators for obstetric safety. We aim to identify a comprehensive list of obstetric safety indicators which may help reduce the number of preventable patient harms, to summarize the data and to synthesize the results. Methods and analysis: We will use the methodological framework described by Arksey and O Malley and further expanded by Levac. We will search multiple electronic databases such as Medline, Embase, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library as well as websites from professional bodies and other organisations, using an iterative search strategy. We will include indicators that relate to preventable harms in the process of obstetric care. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts of search results to determine eligibility for inclusion. For records where eligibility is not clear, the reviewers will screen the full text version. If reviewers decisions regarding eligibility differ, a third reviewer will review the full text record. Two reviewers will independently extract data from records that meet our inclusion criteria using a standardized data collection form. We will narratively describe quantitative data, such as the frequency with which indicators are identified, and conduct a thematic analysis of the qualitative data. We will compile a comprehensive list of patient safety indicators identified during our scoping review and organise them according to concepts that best suit the data such as the Donabedian model or the Hospital Harm Framework. We will discuss the implications of the indicators for future research, clinical practice and policy making. We will report the conduct of the review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA ScR) Checklist. Ethics and Dissemination: The sources of information included in this scoping review will be available to the public. Therefore, ethical review for this research is not warranted. We will disseminate our research results using multiple modes of delivery such as a peer-reviewed publication, conference presentations and stakeholder communications.

848,"Asthma Exacerbation Prediction and Interpretation based on Time-sensitive Attentive Neural Network: A Retrospective Cohort Study","Background: Asthma exacerbation is an acute or sub-acute episode of progressive worsening of asthma symptoms and can have significant impacts on the daily life of patients. In 2016, 12.4 million current asthmatics (46.9%) in the U.S. had at least one asthma exacerbation in the previous year. Objective: The objectives of this study were to predict the risk of asthma exacerbations and to explore potential risk factors involved in progressive asthma. Methods: We proposed a time-sensitive attentive neural network to predict asthma exacerbation using clinical variables from electronic health records (EHRs). The clinical variables were collected from the Cerner Health Facts database between 1992 and 2015 including 31,433 asthmatic adult patients. Interpretations of both the patient level and the cohort level were investigated based on the model parameters. Results: The proposed model obtains an AUC value of 0.7003 through 5-fold cross-validation, which outperforms the baseline methods. The results also demonstrate that the addition of elapsed time embeddings considerably improves the performance on this dataset. Through further analysis, it was witnessed that risk factors behaved distinctly along the timeline and across patients. We also found supporting evidence from peer-reviewed literature for some possible cohort-level risk factors such as respiratory syndromes and esophageal reflux. Conclusions: The proposed time-sensitive attentive neural network is superior to traditional machine learning methods and performs better than state-of-the-art deep learning methods in realizing effective predictive models for the prediction of asthma exacerbation. We believe that the interpretation and visualization of risk factors can help the clinical community to better understand the underlying mechanisms of the disease progression.","Xiang, Y.; Ji, H.; Zhou, Y.; Li, F.; Du, J.; Laila, R.; Wu, S.

769,"Risk of Inflammatory Bowel Disease in Psoriasis Patients Treated with Anti-Interleukin-17 Agents: A Bayesian Metaanalysis","Background: Use of interleukin-17 inhibitors (IL-17i) in psoriasis has been associated with an increased risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the clinical significance of this association is not understood. Objectives: To quantify the absolute risk of IBD in patients with psoriasis treated with IL-17i, stratified by known IBD risk factors. Methods: Literature searches were performed to identify known IBD risk factors and the prevalences were quantified by a meta-analysis of proportions. The Bayesian model was used to estimate the probability of a new-onset or a flare of IBD in patients with psoriasis. Results: The prevalence of Crohn disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC) in the general psoriasis population was 0.0010. Use of IL-17i increased the risk of CD to 0.0037 and UC to 0.0028, translating to a number needed to harm (NNH) of 373 for CD and 564 for UC. In patients who had concomitant hidradenitis suppurativa, the use of IL-17i was associated with a decrease in NNH for CD and UC to 18 and 76, respectively, whereas for patients with a family history of IBD, the NNH values were 6 (for CD) and 10 (for UC). Conclusions: In patients with no risk factors, the probability of IBD flare or onset during IL-17i treatment is negligible and additional IBD screening procedures are not indicated. In contrast, the patients with psoriasis who have hidradenitis suppurativa or first-degree family history of IBD as risk factors should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CD and UC during IL-17i therapy.","Gill, N.; Pietrosanu, M.; Gniadecki, R.",20191119,"Dermatology","10.1101/19012179",1,"Navjeet Gill","Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012179v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012179v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"Data used in this study is available in the supplementary materials."
850,"Does the metabolic syndrome exist? The identification of cardio-metabolic profiles in a South Asian population study","OBJECTIVE Research testing the validity of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) as a clinical construct associated with cardiovascular disease risk has produced inconsistent results. This study tested the existence of the MetS, explored alternative cardiometabolic risk characterisations, and examined the relative influence of genetic and environmental factors in a South Asian sample. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Data came from the Colombo Twin and Singleton follow-up Study, CoTaSS-2 (N=3969). Latent class analysis tested the clustering of MetS indicators (waist circumference, high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), medications and diabetes). Regression analyses tested cross-sectional associations between identified latent classes and covariates. Structural equation modelling estimated genetic and environmental influences on these classes. Analyses were stratified by gender (n=1681 men, n=2288 women). RESULTS Three classes were identified in men: 1) ""Healthy"" (52.3%), 2) ""Central obesity, high TG, high FPG"" (40.2%), and 3) ""Central obesity, high TG, diabetes"" (7.6%). Four classes were identified in women: 1) ""Healthy"" (53.2%), 2) ""Very high central obesity, low HDL-C, raised FPG"" (32.8%), 3) ""Very high central obesity, diabetes"" (7.2%) and 4) ""Central obesity, hypertension, raised FPG"" (6.8%). Older age in men and women, and high socioeconomic status in men, was associated with cardiometabolic risk categories, compared to the ""Healthy"" classes. In men, individual differences in cardiometabolic class membership were due to environmental effects. In females, genetic differences significantly predicted class membership. CONCLUSIONS The findings did not support the MetS construct. Instead, distinct clinical profiles were identified in men and women, suggesting different aetiological pathways.","Harber-Aschan, L.; Bakolis, I.; Glozier, N.; Ismail, K.; Jayaweera, K.; Pannala, G.; Pariante, C.; Rijsdijk, F.; Siribaddana, S.; Sumathipala, A.; Zavos, H.; Zunszain, P.; Hotopf, M.",20191129,"Endocrinology","10.1101/19012195",1,"Lisa Harber-Aschan","King\'s College London","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012195v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012195v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"The data used for the purposes of this study are available upon reasonable request and require the approval of the COTASS steering committee."

We investigate this phenomenon in familial Frontotemporal dementia (FTD). METHODS: We studied 121 presymptomatic FTD mutation carriers and 134 family members without mutations, using multivariate data-driven approach to link cognitive performance with both structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging. Atrophy and brain network connectivity were compared between groups, in relation to the time from expected symptom onset. RESULTS: There were group differences in brain structure and function, in the absence of differences in cognitive performance. Specifically, we identified behaviourally-relevant structural and functional network differences. Structure-function relationships were similar in both groups, but coupling between functional connectivity and cognition was stronger for carriers than for non-carriers, and increased with proximity to the expected onset of disease. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that maintenance of functional network connectivity enables carriers to maintain cognitive performance.","Tsvetanov, K. A.; Gazzina, S.; Jones, S.

866,"Dysmetabolic circulating tumor cells are prognostic in Metastatic Breast Cancer","The prognostic value of the circulating tumor cells (CTCs), defined as EpCAM+, Cytokeratin (8, 18, 19)+ and CD45- nucleated cells, has been provided in metastatic breast cancer (mBC), with Level I of evidence. However, CTCs belong to a heterogeneous pool of rare cells, and there is not consensus on an univocal definition of CTCs. Here, we present a definition of metabolically altered CTCs (MBA-CTC) as CD45-negative cells with an increased extracellular acidification rate (iECAR), supported by the presence of iECAR among the hallmarks of cancer. We tested the prognostic value of MBA-CTC present in mBC patients before starting a new systemic therapy (T0) and 3-4 weeks after (T1). Samples were analyzed in parallel with CellSearch platform (CS). Standard RECIST criteria were used to determine patients' responses to treatment. In our cohort of n=31 mBC patients, a level of MBA-CTCs above the cut-off was associated with: i) a shorter median PFS both pre-therapy (123 days vs 306; p<0.0001) and during therapy (139 vs 266 days; p= 0.0009); ii) a worse OS both pre-therapy (p=0.0003, 82% survival vs 20%) and during therapy (p=0.0301, 67% survival vs 38%); iii) good agreement with therapy response (kappa=0.685). Both the trend of MBA-CTCs over time and the combined results of the two assays (MBA and CS) enabled more accurate stratification. MBA and CS results showed fair (K=0.33) and poor (K=0.077) agreement at T0 and T1, respectively. This fact and the increased accuracy in combining results suggest that the assays detect different CTC subsets. In conclusion, MBA-CTCs does provide prognostic information at least equivalent to CS, and are even more informative when analyzed over time or combined with CS-CTCs.","Brisotto, G.; Biscontin, E.; Rossi, E.; Bulfoni, M.; Piruska, A.; Spazzapan, S.; Poggiana, C.; Vidotto, R.; Steffan, A.; Colombatti, A.; Huck, W.; Cesselli, D.; Zamarchi, R.; Turetta, M.; Del Ben, F.",20191202,"Oncology","10.1101/19012211",2,"Rita Zamarchi","Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV-IRCCS, Padua, Italy.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012211v2?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012211v2.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"All data are available in the text and supplementary materials."

Previously determined genetic ancestries for these men were: 71,856 European, 6,253 African, and 2,382 Asian. Where applicable, age of prostate cancer diagnosis, age at last follow-up, TNM stage, PSA, Gleason score, and cause of death were also determined. Median age at last follow-up was 70 years (IQR 63-76). 3,983 men died from prostate cancer, 5,806 died from non-prostate cancer causes, and 70,702 were still alive at the end of follow-up. Patient samples were previously genotyped on a cancer-specific array; PHS1 was adapted for compatibility with this array (PHS2) and tested in the multi-ethnic dataset via Cox proportional hazards models for age of aggressive prostate cancer onset and for age at prostate-cancer-specific death. Results: PHS2 had 46 SNPs: 24 directly genotyped and 22 acceptable proxies (r2>=0.94). PHS2 was predictive of age of aggressive prostate cancer onset in the independent, multi-ethnic dataset (z=48, p<10-16) and in each genetic ancestry: European (z=46, p<10-16), Asian (z=44, p<10-16), and African (z=24, p<10-16). PHS2 was also predictive of age of prostate cancer death in the multi-ethnic dataset (z=16, p<10-16). Comparing the 80th and 20th percentiles of genetic risk, men with high PHS had a hazard ratio of 5.9 for aggressive prostate cancer and 5.7 for prostate cancer death. Within each genetic ancestry group, analogous hazard ratios for aggressive prostate cancer were 5.6, 5.2, and 2.4 for men of European, Asian, and African ancestry, respectively. Conclusions: PHS2 is highly predictive of both age of onset of aggressive prostate cancer and age of prostate-cancer-specific death in a multi-ethnic dataset. Genetic risk stratification via PHS could guide individualized screening and treatment strategies for fatal and potentially fatal prostate cancer for men of European, Asian, and African genetic ancestry.","Huynh-Le, M.-P.; Fan, C.

788,"Macro-parasite transmission in dynamic seasonal environment: Basic Reproductive Number, endemicity, and control","Seasonality of transmission environment, which includes snail populations and habitats, or human-snail contact patterns, can affect the dynamics of schistosomiasis infection, and control outcomes. Conventional modeling approaches often ignore or oversimplify it by applying 'seasonal mean' formulation. Mathematically, such 'averaging' is justified when model outputs/quantities of interest depend linearly on input variables. That is not generally the case for macroparasite transmission models, where model outputs are nonlinear functions of seasonality fashion. Another commonly used approach for Schistosomiasis modeling is a reduction of coupled human-snail system to a single 'human equation', via quasi-stationary snail (intermediate host) dynamics. The basic questions arising from these approaches are whether such 'seasonal averaging' and 'intermediate host reduction' are suitable for highly variable/seasonal environments, and what implications these methods have on models' predictive potential of control interventions. Here we address these questions by using a combination of mathematical analysis and numerical simulation of two commonly used models for macroparasite transmission, MacDonald (MWB), and stratified worm burden (SWB) snail-human systems. We showed that predictions from 'seasonal averaging' models can depart significantly from those of quasi-stationary models. Typically, seasonality would lower endemicity and sustained infection, vs. stationary system with comparable transmission inputs. Furthermore, discrepancies between the two models ('seasonal' and its 'stationary mean') increase with amplitude (or variance) of seasonality. So sufficiently high variability can render infection unsustainable. Similar discrepancies were observed between coupled and reduced 'single host' models, with reduced model overpredicting sustained endemicity. Seasonal variability of transmission raises the question of optimal control timing. Using dynamic simulation, we show that optimal timing of repeated MDA is about half season past the snail peak, where snail population attains its minimal value. Compared to sub-optimal timing, such strategy can reduce human worm burden by factor 2 after 5-6 rounds of MDA. We also extended our models for dynamic snail populations, which allowed us to study the effect of repeated molluscicide, or combined strategy (MDA + molluscicide). The optimal time for molluscicide alone is the end or the start of season, and combined strategy can give additional reduction, and in some cases lead to elimination. Overall, reduced sustainability in seasonal environment makes it more amenable to control interventions, compared to stationary environment.","Huang, Q.; Gurarie, D.; Ndeffo-Mbah, M.; Lo, N.

771,"StartReact increases probability of muscle activity and distance in severe/moderate stroke survivors during two-dimensional reaching task.","Objective: StartReact elicits faster, larger, and more appropriate muscle activation in stroke survivors but has been only cursorily studied to date during multi-jointed reaching. Our objective was to evaluate StartReact on unrestricted, two-dimensional point-to-point reaching tasks post-stroke. Method: Data from 23 individuals with stroke was collected during point-to-point reaching. Voluntary and StartReact trials were compared between mild, severe/moderate, and the unimpaired arm. Results: StartReact showed an increase in probability of muscle activity, larger muscle activity amplitude and faster muscle activity onset. Despite changes in muscle activity, metrics of movement (distance, final error, linear deviation) were largely the same between StartReact and Voluntary trials except in severe/moderate stroke who had larger reaching distances during StartReact. Conclusion: While StartReact impacted many metrics of muscle activity, the most profound effect was on probability of muscle activity increasing 34% compared to Voluntary which allowed severe/moderate subjects to increase reaching distance but did not translate to decrease in final error suggesting that the additional movement was not always directed towards the appropriate target. Significance: These results indicate that SR has the capacity to activate paralyzed muscle in severe/moderate patients, but future studies are needed to explore the possible use of SR in the rehabilitation.

783,"Redefining the multidimensional clinical phenotypes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes","The syndromes caused by frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) have highly heterogenous and overlapping clinical features. There has been great progress in the refinement of clinical diagnostic criteria in the last decade, but we propose that a better understanding of aetiology, pathophysiology and symptomatic treatments can arise from a transdiagnostic approach to clinical phenotype and brain morphometry. In a cross-sectional epidemiological study, we examined 310 patients with a syndrome likely to be caused by frontotemporal lobar degeneration, including behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), the non-fluent (nfvPPA), semantic (svPPA) variants of primary progressive aphasia, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal syndrome (CBS). We also included patients with logopenic primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA) and those who met criteria for PPA but not one of the three subtypes. To date, forty-nine patients have a neuropathological diagnosis. A principal component analysis identified symptom dimensions that broadly recapitulated the core features of the main clinical syndromes. However, the subject-specific scores on these dimensions showed considerable overlap across the diagnostic groups. Sixty-two percent of participants had phenotypic features that met the diagnostic criteria for more than one syndrome. Behavioural disturbance was prevalent in all groups. Forty-four percent of patients with CBS had PSP-like features and thirty percent of patients with PSP had CBS-like features. Many patients with PSP and CBS had language impairments consistent with nfvPPA while patients with bvFTD often had semantic impairments. Using multivariate source-based morphometry on a subset of patients (n=133), we identified patterns of co-varying brain atrophy that were represented across the diagnostic groups. Canonical correlation analysis of clinical and imaging components found three key brain-behaviour relationships that revealed a continuous spectrum across the cohort rather than discrete diagnostic entities. In the forty-six patients with longitudinal follow up (mean 3.6 years) syndromic overlap increased with time. Together, these results show that syndromes associated with FTLD do not form discrete mutually exclusive categories from their clinical features or structural brain changes, but instead exist in a multidimensional spectrum. Patients often manifest diagnostic features of multiple disorders and deficits in behaviour, movement and language domains are not confined to specific diagnostic groups. It is important to recognise individual differences in clinical phenotype, both for clinical management and to understand pathogenic mechanisms. We suggest that the adoption of a transdiagnostic approach to the spectrum of FTLD syndromes provides a useful framework with which to understand disease progression, heterogeneity and treatment.","Murley, A.

773,"Step-downs reduce workers compensation payments to encourage return to work. Are they effective?","Objective: To determine whether step-downs, which cut the rate of compensation paid to injured workers after they have been on benefits for several months, incentivise return to work. Methods: We aggregated administrative claims data from nine Australian workers compensation systems to calculate weekly scheme exit rates, a proxy for return to work. Jurisdictions were further subdivided into four condition subgroups: fractures, musculoskeletal, mental health, and other trauma. The effect of step-downs on scheme exit was tested using a regression discontinuity design. Results were pooled into meta-analyses to calculate combined effects and the proportion of variance attributable to heterogeneity. Results: The combined effect of step-downs was a 0.61 percentage point (95% CI -1.16 to -0.05) reduction in the exit rate, with significant heterogeneity between jurisdictions (I2 = 73%, p = .001). Most significant effects were observed within earliest step-downs, implemented at 13 weeks of benefit payment. Within condition subgroups, only fractures had a significant combined effect (-0.84, 95% CI -1.61 to -0.07), and sensitivity analysis suggested a potentially meaningful effect among mental health claims as well. Conclusions: The results suggest step-downs prompt an anticipatory effect, meaning some claimants leave compensation ahead of the step-down to avoid the reduction in benefits. However, the effects were small and, given their anticipatory nature, probably short-lived. Our findings were statistically significant, but questions remain about practical significance. We find limited evidence that step-downs are an effective incentive for return to work.","Lane, T.; Sheehan, L. R.; Gray, S.

The objective of this research was to evaluate factors that might affect information retrieval (IR) methods and to investigate the interplay between commonly used IR approaches and the characteristics of the cohort definition structure. We used an IR test collection containing 56 test patient cohort definitions, 100,000 patient records originating from an academic medical institution EHR data warehouse, and automated word-base query tasks, varying four parameters. Performance was measured using B-Pref. We then designed 59 taxonomy characteristics to classify the structure of the 56 topics. In addition, six topic complexity measures were derived from these characteristics for further evaluation using a beta regression simulation. We did not find a strong association between the 59 taxonomy characteristics and patient retrieval performance, but we did find strong performance associations with the six topic complexity measures created from these characteristics, and interactions between these measures and the automated query parameter settings. Some of the characteristics derived from a query taxonomy could lead to improved selection of approaches based on the structure of the topic of interest. Insights gained here will help guide future work to develop new methods for patient-level cohort discovery with EHR data.","Chamberlin, S. R.; Bedrick, S. D.; Cohen, A.

760,"Digitising point of care HIV test results to accurately measure, and improve performance towards, the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets","Introduction: High rates of pre-treatment loss to care among persons diagnosed with HIV persist. Linkage to care can be improved through active digitally-based surveillance. Currently, record-keeping for HIV diagnoses in South Africa is paper-based. Aggregated testing data are reported routinely, and only discordant findings result in a specimen being tested at a laboratory and digitised. Methods: The Western Cape Province in South Africa has a Provincial Health Data Centre (PHDC) where person-level routine data are consolidated in a single database, leveraging the existence of a unique patient identifier. To facilitate improved surveillance, a pre-carbonated point-of-care test (PoCT) form was piloted, where one copy was routed to the centralised laboratory and digitised for PHDC inclusion. We evaluated the utility of the intervention using cross-sectional and retrospective cohort analyses, as well as comparisons with reported aggregate data. Results: From May 2017 to June 2018, 11337 digitised point-of-care HIV testing records were linked to the PHDC. Overall, 96% of records in the aggregate dataset were digitised, with 97% linked to the PHDC. Of those tested, 79% were female (median age 27 years). Linkage demonstrated that 51.3% of patients testing HIV-positive were retesting. Of those truly newly diagnosed, 81% were linked to HIV care and 25% were initiated on antiretroviral therapy immediately. Conclusion: Digitisation of PoCT results is feasible and provides individuated HIV testing data to assist in linkage to care and in differentiating newly diagnosed patients from positive patients retesting. Actionable and accurate data can improve the measurement of performance towards the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets.","Jacob, N.; Rice, B.; Kalk, E.; Heekes, A.; Morgan, J.; Hargreaves, J.; Boulle, A.",20191115,"Hiv Aids","10.1101/19012302",1,"Nisha Jacob","University of Cape Town","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012302v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012302v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"Data are not made available as they are unconsented, de-identified routine administrative data housed in the Western Cape Provincial Health Data Centre."
756,"Prevalence and associated occupational factors for low back pain among the bank employees in Dhaka City","Objective: Low Back Pain (LBP) is one of the common health problems among full-time office employees that causes employees absenteeism from work. The purpose of the study is to identify the association between occupational factors and LBP among full-time bank employees in Dhaka City. Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study with 593 full-time bank employees. The one-month complaints of LBP were administered by a musculoskeletal subscale of subjective health complaints by Eriksen et al. A logistic model was performed to identify variables associated with LBP, and a random forest technique was performed to identify the top 5 important variables. Results: The one-month prevalence for LBP was found 36.6% among the bank employees and the prevalence was high (46.6%) for the 41 to 59-year-old age-group. The multiple logistic regression analysis indicates that age (41-59 years) (OR:2.11, CI=1.21-3.74), obesity (OR:2.06, CI=1.01-4.21) and long working hours (>9 hours) (OR:1.42, CI=1.01-2.0) are positively associated with LBP. Age and length of employment have a positive correlation of 0.87. The random forest technique identifies the top 5 important variables are, age, length of employment, long office hours, presence of chronic illness, and physical activity. Conclusion: LBP is highly prevalent in full-time bank employees. The occupational factors like length of employment (>10 years) and long working hours (>9 hours) play a significant role in developing LBP among the bank employees. Moreover, the factors like age, chronic illness, obesity and physical activity should be taken into account in the prevention of LBP in bank employees.

770,"Limited Capacity for Ipsilateral Secondary Motor Areas to Support Hand Function Post-Stroke","Recent findings have shown connections of ipsilateral cortico-reticulospinal tract (CRST), predominantly originating from secondary motor areas, to not only proximal but also distal portions of the arm. In unilateral stroke, CRST from the ipsilateral side is intact and thus has been proposed as a possible backup system for post-stroke rehabilitation even for the hand. We argue that although CRST from ipsilateral secondary motor areas can provide control for proximal joints, it is insufficient to control either hand or coordinated shoulder and hand movements due to its extensive branching compared to contralateral corticospinal tract. To address this issue, we combined MRI, high-density EEG, and robotics in 17 individuals with severe chronic hemiparetic stroke and 12 age-matched controls. We tested for changes in structural morphometry of the sensorimotor cortex and found that individuals with stroke demonstrated higher gray matter density in secondary motor areas ipsilateral to the paretic arm compared to controls. We then measured cortical activity while participants attempted to generate hand opening either supported on a table or while lifting against a shoulder abduction load. The addition of shoulder abduction during hand opening increased reliance on ipsilateral secondary motor areas in stroke, but not controls. Crucially, increased use of ipsilateral secondary motor areas was associated with decreased hand opening ability while lifting the arm due to involuntary coupling between the shoulder and wrist/finger flexors. Together, this evidence implicates a compensatory role for ipsilateral (i.e., contralesional) secondary motor areas post-stroke, but with limited capacity to support hand function.","Wilkins, K.

785,"No Association between HPV Vaccination and Infertility in U.S. Females 18-33 Years Old","Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines have been recommended as primary prevention of HPV-related cancers for over 10 years in the United States, and evidence reveals decreased incidence of HPV infections following vaccination. However, concerns have been raised that HPV vaccines could decrease fertility. This study examined the relationship between HPV immunization and self-reported infertility in a nationally representative sample. Methods: Data from the 2013-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed to asses likelihood of self-reported infertility among women aged 20 to 33, who were young enough to have been offered HPV vaccines and old enough to have been queried about infertility (n=1,114). Two logistic regression models, stratified by marital history, examined potential associations between HPV vaccination and infertility. Model 1 assessed the likelihood of infertility among women who had never been pregnant or whose pregnancies occurred prior to HPV vaccination. Model 2 accounted for the possibility of latent and/or non-permanent post-vaccine infertility by including all women 20-33 years old. Results: 8.1% reported any infertility. Women who had ever been married and had received an HPV vaccine were less likely to report infertility (OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.01-0.57) in model 1. No other associations between HPV and infertility were found. Conclusion: There was no evidence of increased infertility among women who received the HPV vaccine. These results provide further evidence of HPV vaccine safety and should give providers confidence in recommending HPV vaccination. Further research should explore protective effects of HPV vaccines on female and male fertility. What is already known on this subject? Despite evidence that HPV vaccines are safe and effective, concerns persist regarding a purported link between HPV vaccination and infertility. These concerns were refuted by a recent population-based cohort study that found no association between the HPV vaccine and primary ovarian insufficiency. What this study adds? This study broadens the existing evidence by exploring possible associations between HPV vaccination and any self-reported infertility. There was no evidence of infertility among women 20-33 years old who received one or more doses of HPV vaccine. This result provides further evidence of HPV vaccine safety, diminishing remaining concerns among clinicians and the public.","Mooney, K. E.; Schmuhl, N. B.; Zhang, X.; Cooney, L. G.; Conway, J.

776,"Novel meta-analysis pipeline of heterogeneous high-throughput gene expression datasets reveals dysregulated interactions and pathways in asthma","Introduction: Asthma is a complex and chronic inflammatory disorder with varying degrees of airway inflammation. It affects ~235 million people worldwide, and about 8% of the United States population. Unlike single-gene disorders, asthma phenotypes are guided by a highly variable combination of genotypes, making it a complex disease to study computationally. Recently, several independent high-throughput gene expression studies in bioinformatics have identified and proposed numerous molecular drivers involved in asthma initiation and progression. However, there is a poor consensus in our understanding of the molecular factors involved in the mechanism of this disease due to inherent genetic heterogeneity. Such an uncertainty in bioinformatics studies have led to a ""reproducibility crisis"" in the field, where similar analyses can often yield greatly varying results. In this study, we seek to harness heterogeneity in asthma by applying a meta-analysis that explores varying tissue environments. Methods: We use three publicly-available microarray gene expression datasets, belonging to different tissues in asthma patients, from NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). As a meta-analysis, we apply a mixed-model effect size test to determine differentially expressed (DE) genes across all three studies. Then, The datasets are pre-processed and subjected to Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) for identification of functional modules. Using module preservation, we determine modules in asthma that were not preserved in the healthy condition, then combine the three with a Fisher's test for a set of asthma-unique modules. These modules are explored using functional analysis (i.e. GO term analysis). Using the DE genes as well as known transcription factors, we re-construct Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) for each of our shortlisted modules. We then studied the topology of these GRNs using hive plots to reveal underlying dysregulations, paving the way for future analyses. Results: Our analysis reveals a novel perspective to a key interaction in asthma inflammatory regulation, the CHD4-CCL26 transcription relation. Our hive plot analysis is able to explore this gene interaction beyond the typical ""over-expression, under-expression"" results from typical bioinformatics studies. We reveal that CCL26, an important regulator of asthma, appears to increase in expression and topological degree in asthma, but loses connection to CHD4, which seems to be characteristic to the asthma disease. Such analysis suggests that the topology of gene networks, above simply expression values, may be key to understanding the nuanced interactions between fundamental biomarkers and drug targets in complex diseases like asthma.","Guo, B.; Kaushik, A.; Nadeau, K.

777,"Vascular Territory, White Matter Connections and the Neuroanatomical Basis of Memory Impairment after Stroke","Objective: To investigate neuroanatomical correlates of memory impairment 30-90 days after stroke, including the role of white matter connections in the core circuit for episodic memory. Methods: A cohort of 179 patients with first symptomatic ischaemic stroke were enrolled into a longitudinal cognitive study, STRATEGIC. Verbal and visual memory were assessed at 5019 (range 22-109) days. Lesion topography was defined by imaging (n=152). In a representative subgroup (n=53), 3T MRI and tractography was used to define patterns of tract injury and microstructure of uninjured tracts. Results: Lesion location, defined by arterial territory, was associated with verbal memory impairment (F(12,164)=2.62, p=0.003), independent of other factors such as age, risk factor status and lesion volume. Independent lesion symptom mapping identified regions of the left posterior temporal white matter, within the left posterior cerebral artery territory, associated specifically with verbal recall. Visual recognition memory was associated with microstructure of the uninjured fornix but not with lesion location. Conclusions: Infarct location strongly influenced verbal recall performance 50 days after stroke. Damage in two locations underpinned this relationship: the thalamus; and within the left PCA territory, where disconnection of parahippocampal white matter projections contributed to verbal memory impairment in some cases. The correlates of early cognitive prognosis were domain-specific with a different pattern of associations with executive function. The association between microstructure of the uninjured fornix and visual memory might reflect the effects of comorbid pathology on hippocampal circuits.","Wright, P.; O'sullivan, M.

779,"Transdiagnostic expression of interoceptive abnormalities in psychiatric conditions","Background: Interoception, the sensing of information about the internal physiological state of the body, is proposed to be fundamental to normal and abnormal affective feelings. We undertook a cross-sectional characterisation of cardiac interoception in patients accessing secondary mental health services to understand how interoceptive abnormalities relate to psychiatric symptoms and diagnoses. Methods: Patients attending adult mental health services (205 female, 101 male) and controls (42 female, 21 male) participated. Clinical diagnoses spanned affective disorders, personality disorders and psychoses. Physiological, bio-behavioural and subjective interoceptive measures included: 1) Basal heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV); 2) cardiac afferent effects on emotional processing (cardiac cycle modulation of ratings of fear vs. neutral faces); 3) perceptual accuracy, confidence, and metacognitive insight in heartbeat detection, and; 4) self-reported sensitivity to internal bodily sensations. We tested for transdiagnostic differences between patients and controls, then for correlations between interoceptive measures and affective symptoms, and for group differences across clinical diagnostic categories. Results: Patients differed from controls in HRV, cardiac afferent effects on emotional processing, heartbeat discrimination accuracy, and heartbeat detection confidence. Anxiety and depression symptom severity correlated particularly with self-reported sensitivity to interoceptive experiences. Significant differences between diagnostic categories were observed for HRV, cardiac afferent effects on emotional processing, and subjective interoception. Patients with schizophrenia relative to other diagnoses intriguingly showed opposite cardiac afferent effects on emotion processing. Conclusions: This multilevel characterisation identified interoceptive differences associated with psychiatric symptoms and diagnoses. Interoceptive mechanisms have potential value for the clinical stratification and therapeutic targeting of psychiatric disorders.","Critchley, H. D.; Ewing, D.

775,"Appraisal of the pleiotropic effects of intelligence and education on schizophrenia: a univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization study","Education and intelligence are highly correlated and inversely associated with schizophrenia. Counterintuitively, education genetically associates with an increased risk for the disease. To investigate why, this study applies a multivariable Mendelian randomization of intelligence and education. For those without college degrees, older age of finishing school associates with a decreased likelihood of schizophrenia, independent of intelligence, and, hence, may be entangled with the health inequalities reflecting differences in education. A different picture is observed for schooling years inclusive of college: more years of schooling increases the likelihood of schizophrenia, whereas higher intelligence distinctly and independently decreases it. This implies the pleiotropy between years of schooling and schizophrenia is horizontal and likely confounded by a third trait influencing education. A multivariable Mendelian randomization of schooling years and bipolar disorder reveals that the increased risk of schizophrenia conferred by more schooling years is an artefact of bipolar disorder, not education.","Adams, C.

840,"Interpretable AI for beat-to-beat cardiac function assessment","Accurate assessment of cardiac function is crucial for diagnosing cardiovascular disease, screening for cardiotoxicity and deciding clinical management in patients with critical illness. However human assessment of cardiac function focuses on a limited sampling of cardiac cycles and has significant interobserver variability despite years of training. To overcome this challenge, we present the first beat-to-beat deep learning algorithm that surpasses human expert performance in the critical tasks of segmenting the left ventricle, estimating ejection fraction, and assessing cardiomyopathy. Trained on echocardiogram videos, our model accurately segments the left ventricle with a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.92, predicts ejection fraction with mean absolute error of 4.1%, and reliably classifies heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (AUC of 0.97). Prospective evaluation with repeated human measurements confirms that our model has less variance than experts. By leveraging information across multiple cardiac cycles, our model can identify subtle changes in ejection fraction, is more reproducible than human evaluation, and lays the foundation for precise diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. As a new resource to promote further innovation, we also make publicly available one of the largest medical video dataset of over 10,000 annotated echocardiograms.","Ouyang, D.; He, B.; Ghorbani, A.; Langlotz, C.; Heidenreich, P.

808,"PROMISE (Program Refinements to Optimize Model Impact and Scalability based on Evidence): A cluster-randomized, stepped-wedge trial assessing effectiveness of the revised versus original Ryan White Part A HIV Care Coordination Program for patients with barriers to treatment","Introduction: Growing evidence supports combining social, behavioral and biomedical strategies to strengthen the HIV care continuum. However, combination interventions can be resource-intensive and challenging to scale up. Research is needed to identify intervention components and delivery models that maximize uptake, engagement and effectiveness. In New York City (NYC), a multi-component Ryan White-funded medical case management intervention called the Care Coordination Program (CCP) was launched at 28 agencies in 2009 to address barriers to care and treatment. Effectiveness estimates based on >7,000 clients enrolled by April 2013 and their controls indicated modest CCP benefits over usual care for short- and long-term viral suppression, with substantial room for improvement. Methods and analysis: Integrating evaluation findings and CCP service-provider and community-stakeholder input on modifications, the NYC Health Department packaged a Care Coordination Redesign (CCR) in a 2017 request for proposals. Following competitive re-solicitation, 17 of the original CCP-implementing agencies secured contracts. These agencies were randomized within matched pairs to immediate or delayed CCR implementation. Data from three nine-month periods (pre-implementation, partial implementation and full implementation) will be examined to compare CCR versus CCP effects on timely viral suppression (TVS, within four months of enrollment) among individuals with unsuppressed HIV viral load newly enrolling in the CCR/CCP. Based on estimated enrollment (n=824) and the pre-implementation outcome probability (TVS=0.45), the detectable effect size with 80% power is an odds ratio of 2.90 (relative risk: 1.56). Ethics and dissemination: This study was approved by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Institutional Review Board (IRB, Protocol 18-009) and the City University of New York Integrated IRB (Protocol 018-0057) with a waiver of informed consent. Findings will be disseminated via publications, conferences, stakeholder meetings, and Advisory Board meetings with implementing agency representatives.

795,"Cost-effectiveness of implementing objective diagnostic verification of asthma in the United States","Background: Asthma diagnosis in the community is often made without objective testing. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of implementing a stepwise objective diagnostic verification algorithm among patients with community-diagnosed asthma in the United States (US). Methods: We developed a probabilistic time-in-state cohort model that compared a stepwise asthma verification algorithm based on spirometry and methacholine challenge test against the current standard of care over 20 years. Model input parameters were informed from the literature and with original data analyses when required. The target population was US adults (15 y/o or older) with physician-diagnosed asthma. The final outcomes were costs (in 2018 $) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), discounted at 3% annually. Deterministic and probabilistic analyses were undertaken to examine the effect of alternative assumptions and uncertainty in model parameters on the results. Results: In a simulated cohort of 10,000 adults with diagnosed asthma, the stepwise algorithm resulted in the removal of diagnosis in 3,366. This was projected to be associated with savings of $36.26 million in direct costs and a gain of 4,049.28 QALYs over 20 years. Extrapolating these results to the US population indicated an undiscounted potential savings of $56.48 billion over 20 years. Results were robust against alternative assumptions and plausible changes in values of input parameters. Conclusion: Implementation of a simple diagnostic testing algorithm to verify asthma diagnosis might result in substantial savings and improvement in patients quality of life.","Yaghoubi, M.; Adibi, A.; Zafari, Z.; Fitzgerald, J.

787,"Expanded Choices with Greater HIV Prevention Benefits: A Mathematical Model of Long-Acting Injectable and Daily-Oral Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis","Objective: To assess the population impact of long-acting injectable pre-exposure prophylaxis (LAI-PrEP) when available concurrently with daily oral (DO) PrEP among men who have sex with men (MSM). Design: Dynamic network model of HIV transmission among MSM. Methods: We calibrated our model to the current uptake of DO-PrEP (15% among indicated) and HIV prevalence (25.3%) among MSM in the southeastern US. Parameters for LAI-PrEP pharmacokinetics and efficacy were estimated from Phase IIa safety trials in human and macaque models. Primary analyses explored varied conditions of PrEP uptake and proportion choosing LAI-PrEP given initiation. Secondary analyses evaluated uncertainty in pharmacokinetic efficacy and in persistence to LAI-PrEP relative to DO-PrEP. Results: If 50% of MSM currently accessing DO-PrEP choose LAI-PrEP when it becomes available, an additional 14.3% of infections could be averted over 10 years. If the availability of LAI-PrEP increased overall uptake of PrEP to 50%, the expected infections averted would increase to 23.9%. The benefit of LAI-PrEP was weakly sensitive to pharmacokinetics with 9.9% of infections averted even if LAI-PrEP efficacy were half of current empirical estimates. The superiority of LAI-PrEP was strongly attributable to better adherence and persistence with only 4.3% of infections averted if persistence were the same as DO-PrEP. Conclusions: LAI-PrEP availability is projected to decrease HIV incidence. However, increased benefits depend upon improvements to adherence and persistence above current DO-PrEP levels. As LAI-PrEP becomes available, uptake and persistence should be monitored to ensure optimal implementation.","Maloney, K. M.; Driggers, R. A.; Sarkar, S.; Anderson, E.; Malik, A.; Jenness, S.

799,"Global and Historical Distribution of Clostridioides difficile in the Human Diet (1981-2019): Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 21886 Samples Reveal Sources of Heterogeneity, High-Risk Foods, and Unexpected Higher Prevalence Towards the Tropic","Clostridioides difficile (CD) is a spore-forming bacterium that causes life-threatening intestinal infections in humans. Although formerly regarded as exclusively nosocomial, there is increasing genomic evidence that person-to-person transmission accounts for only <25% of cases, supporting the culture-based hypothesis that foods may be routine sources of CD-spore ingestion in humans. To synthesize the evidence on the risk of CD exposure via foods, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting the culture prevalence of CD in foods between January 1981 and November 2019. Meta-analyses, risk-ratio estimates, and meta-regression were used to estimate weighed-prevalence across studies and food types to identify laboratory and geographical sources of heterogeneity. In total, 21,886 food samples were tested for CD between 1981 and 2019 (232 food-sample-sets; 79 studies; 25 countries). Culture methodology, sample size and type, region, and latitude were significant sources of heterogeneity (p<0.05). Although non-strictly-anaerobic methods were reported in some studies, and we confirmed experimentally that improper anaerobiosis of media/sample-handling affects CD recovery in agar (Fisher, p<0.01), most studies (>72%) employed the same (one-of-six) culture strategy. Because the prevalence was also meta-analytically similar across six culture strategies reported, all studies were integrated using three meta-analytical methods. At the study level (n=79), the four-decade global cumulative-prevalence of CD in the human diet was 4.1% (95%CI=-3.71, 11.91). At the food-set level (n=232), the weighted prevalence ranged between 4.5% (95%CI=3-6%; all studies) and 8% (95%CI=7-8%; only CD-positive-studies). Risk-ratio ranking and meta-regression showed that milk was the least likely source of CD, while seafood, leafy green vegetables, pork, and poultry carried higher risks (p<0.05). Across regions, the risk of CD in foods for foodborne exposure reproducibly decreased with Earth latitude (p<0.001). In conclusion, CD in the human diet is a global nonrandom-source of foodborne exposure that occurs independently of laboratory culture methods, across regions, and at variable level depending on food type and latitude. The latitudinal trend (high CD-food-prevalence towards tropic) is inverse to the epidemiological observations of CD-infections (frequent in temperate regions). Findings suggests the plausible hypothesis that ecologically-richer microbiomes in the tropic might protect against intestinal CD colonization/infections despite CD ingestion.","Rodriguez-Palacios, A.; Mo, K.

865,"Can we predict early 7-day readmissions using a standard 30-day hospital readmission risk prediction model?","Despite focus on preventing 30-day readmissions, early readmissions (within 7 days of discharge) may be more preventable than later readmissions (8-30 days). We assessed how well a previously validated 30-day readmission prediction model predicts 7-day readmissions. We re-derived model coefficients for the same predictors as in the original 30-day model to optimize prediction of 7-day readmissions. We compared model performance and compared differences in strength of model factors between the 7-day model to the 30-day model. While there was no substantial change in model performance between the original 30-day and the re-derived 7-day model, there was significant change in strength of predictors. Characteristics at discharge were more predictive of 7-day readmissions, while baseline characteristics were less predictive. Improvements in predicting early 7-day readmissions will likely require new risk factors proximal to the day of discharge.","Saleh, S. N.; Makam, A. N.; Halm, E. A.; Nguyen, O.

814,"Drivers of Frailty from Adulthood into Old Age: Results from a 27-year Longitudinal Population-Based Study in Sweden","Background. Frailty is a strong predictor of adverse aging outcomes. However, the longitudinal drivers of frailty are not well understood. This study aimed at investigating the longitudinal trajectories of a frailty index (FI) from adulthood to late life and identifying the predictors of the level and rate of change in FI. Methods. An age-based latent growth curve analysis was performed in the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (N=1,842; aged 29-102 years) using data from up to 15 measurement waves across 27 years. A 42-item FI was used to measure frailty at each wave. Results. A bilinear, two-slope model with a turning point at age 65 best described the age-related change in FI, showing that the rate of increase in frailty was more than twice as fast after age 65. Underweight, obesity, female sex, overweight, being separated from one's co-twin during childhood, smoking, poor social support and low physical activity were associated with a higher level of FI at age 65, with underweight having the largest effect size. When tested as time-varying predictors, underweight and higher social support were associated with a steeper increase in FI before age 65, whereas overweight and obesity were associated with less steep increase in FI after age 65. Conclusions. Predictors for the level and rate of change in frailty are largely actionable and could provide targets for intervention. Underweight increased the risk of higher FI trajectory until age 65, whereas being overweight or obese were associated with slower progression of frailty towards the oldest ages.","Raymond, E.

Little is known about their physiopathological mechanisms. Objectives: We aimed to identify rare genetic causes to elucidate molecular mechanisms implicated in FMD and SCAD. Methods: We analyzed 29 exomes that included familial and sporadic FMD. Follow-up was conducted by targeted or Sanger sequencing (1,071 FMD and 365 SCAD patients) or lookups in exome (264 FMD) or genome sequences (488 SCAD), all independent and unrelated. We used TRAPD burden test to test for enrichment in patients compared to gnomAD controls. The biological effects of variants on receptor signaling and protein expression were characterized using transient overexpression in human cells. Results: We identified one rare loss-of-function variant (LoF) (MAFgnomAD=0.000075) shared by two FMD sisters in the prostaglandin I2 receptor (hIP) gene (PTGIR), a key player in vascular remodeling. Follow-up in >1,300 FMD patients revealed four additional LoF allele carriers and a putative enrichment in FMD (P=0.0008), in addition to several rare missense variants. We confirmed the LoFs (Q163X and P17RfsX6) and one missense (L67P) to severely impair hIP function in vitro. Genetic analyses of PTGIR in SCAD revealed one patient who carries Q163X, one with L67P and one carrying a rare splicing mutation (c.768+1C>G), but not a significant enrichment (PTRAPD=0.12) in SCAD. Conclusions: Our study shows that rare genetic mutations in PTGIR are enriched among FMD patients and found in SCAD patients, suggesting a role for prostacyclin signaling in non-atherosclerotic stenosis and dissection.","Georges, A.; Albuisson, J.; Berrandou, T.

798,"Labelling chest x-ray reports using an open-source NLP and ML tool for text data binary classification","The chest x-ray is a commonly requested diagnostic test on internal medicine wards which can diagnose many acute pathologies needing intervention. We developed a natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) model to identify the presence of opacities or endotracheal intubation on chest x-rays using only the radiology report. This a preliminary report of our work and findings. Using the General Medicine Inpatient Initiative (GEMINI) dataset, housing inpatient clinical and administrative data from 7 major hospitals, we retrieved 1000 plain film radiology reports which were classified according to 4 labels by an internal medicine resident. NLP/ML models were developed to identify the following on the radiograph reports: the report is that of a chest x-ray, there is definite absence of an opacity, there is definite presence of an opacity, the report is a follow-up report with minimal details in its text, and there is an endotracheal tube in place. Our NLP/ML model development methodology included a random search of either TF-IDF or bag-of-words for vectorization along with random search of various ML models. Our Python programming scripts were made publicly available on GitHub to allow other parties to train models using their own text data. 100 randomly generated ML pipelines were compared using 10-fold cross validation on 75% of the data, while 25% of the data was left out for generalizability testing. With respect to the question of whether a chest x-ray definitely lacks an opacity, the model's performance metrics were accuracy of 0.84, precision of 0.94, recall of 0.81, and receiver operating characteristic area under curve of 0.86.

819,"Structural neuroimaging biomarkers for obsessive-compulsive disorder in the ENIGMA-OCD consortium: medication matters","No diagnostic biomarkers are available for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have provided evidence for structural abnormalities in distinct brain regions, but effect sizes are small and have limited clinical relevance. To investigate whether individual patients can be distinguished from healthy controls, we performed multivariate analysis of structural neuroimaging data from the ENIGMA-OCD consortium. We included 46 data sets with neuroimaging and clinical data from adult ([&ge;]18 years) and pediatric (<18 years) samples. T1 images from 2,304 OCD patients and 2,068 healthy controls were analyzed using standardized processing to extract regional measures of cortical thickness, surface area and subcortical volume. Machine learning classification performance was tested using cross-validation, and possible effects of clinical variables were investigated by stratification. Classification performance for OCD versus controls using the complete sample with different classifiers and cross-validation strategies was poor (AUC-0.57 (standard deviation (SD)=0.02;Pcorr=0.19) to 0.62 (SD=0.03;Pcorr<.001)). When models were validated on completely new data from other sites, model performance did not exceed chance-level (AUC-0.51 (SD=0.11;Pcorr>.99) to 0.54 (SD=0.08;Pcorr>.99)). In contrast, good classification performance (>0.8 AUC) was achieved within subgroups of patients split according to their medication status. To conclude: parcellated structural MRI data do not enable good distinction between patients with OCD and controls. However, classifying subgroups of patients based on medication status enables good identification at the individual subject level.

797,"Olanzapine for the Prevention and Treatment of Nausea and Vomiting Induced by Chemotherapy for Lung Cancer: protocol for a multicenter, double-blind and randomized controlled trial","Background: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is frequently observed after the administration of chemotherapy and significantly influences the quality of life (QoL) of patients. Olanzapine has a high control rate of CINV in patients with cancer when combined with the NK-1 receptor antagonist dexamethasone and 5- hydroxytryptamine (5-HT3) receptor antagonists. The efficacy of a regimen without an NK-1 receptor antagonist remains unknown. Therefore, we designed this randomized trial to provide evidence for the management of CINV. Methods and ananlysis: This is a double-blind, multicenter and randomized controlled trial. Patients with histologically confirmed lung cancer will be assessed by physicians based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and 156 participants will be enrolled and randomized to a placebo group or experiment group to receive treatment for CINV. The primary endpoint is the incidence of delayed CINV. The secondary endpoints are complete response (CR) of acute CINV, CR of delayed CINV, effective control rate (ECR) of CINV and QoL. During the six days after administration, these endpoints will be evaluated and recorded by physicians.","Zhou, J.; Pei-Jie, L.; Su-Han, J.; Lang, H.; Da-Hai, L.; Ming-Ze, C.; Yu, Z.; Hu, M.",20191122,"Oncology","10.1101/19012583",1,"Jianguo Zhou Sr.","Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012583v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012583v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"All of these study data are available upon reasonable request and can be obtained by contacting with the corresponding author."
827,"Shifting of economic responsibilities on vulnerable shoulders for survival of families: a scenario from mining industry in India","Context: Mining industry has boomed precipitously to provide for demand of metal and minerals for emerging infrastructure. It is major occupation in India involving large work force, although it is hazardous. Aims: To assess the socio-demographic profile of sandstone mine workers in Jodhpur and to identify their major social issues. Material and Methods: Study design: Cross-sectional study; Setting: Residential area of mine workers, Jodhpur, Rajasthan; Participants: Mine workers residing in residential areas in Jodhpur district for more than 6 months, and who gave consent for participation in study. Data on socioeconomic status and occupation of each family members was collected; Analysis: Data was analysed using SPSS v.23. P value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: One thousand six hundred four mine workers were enrolled in study. More than three fourth (78.7%) of them were male. Their age ranged between 14 to 82 years with mean age of 37.62 years. Mean age of female workers was significantly higher than of male workers. Average years of working for males was significantly higher than females. Mean age of entry into mines for male workers (20.33) was significantly lower than females (24.59). About 2.68% children below 14 years of age were involved in any sort of income generation activity.

791,"Antimicrobial resistance trends from a hospital and diagnostic facility in Lahore, Pakistan: A five-year retrospective analysis (2014-2018)","Objective: Observing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) trends is critical to identify emerging pathogens and potential disease outbreaks. Determining these trends also allows for policy evaluations and development of interventions. We performed a retrospective analysis of microbiological testing results from a hospital and diagnostic facility in Lahore, Pakistan that represents country-wide sampling. Within this analysis, data was disaggregated by nationality, as it has been suggested that migration increases the burden of AMR. We sought to determine any trends in AMR among populations, which are often at-risk, while contributing to AMR surveillance in Pakistan, which currently does not have a national surveillance network. Methods: Retrospective analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility records from 2014 to 2018 from Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital & Research Centre (SKMCH&RC) in Lahore, Pakistan was performed. All positive microbiological cultures from patients was analyzed to assess antibiotic resistance rates of the most common bacterial isolates and incidence of ESKAPE pathogens and emerging outbreaks among adults and children. Results: For all years, data for a total of 12,702 and 78,130 bacterial and fungal isolates from children and adults, respectively, with Pakistani nationality were analyzed. For all years, data for 597 and 2470 bacterial and fungal isolates for children and adults, respectively, with Afghan nationality were analyzed. AMR rates largely did not vary between populations, but rather followed similar trends. AMR rates also largely agreed with the World Health Organization Global Antimicrobial Surveillance System results for Pakistan. Conclusion: Pakistan requires increased AMR surveillance to identify emerging resistance infections and outbreaks.","Ching, C.; Nizamuddin, S.; Rasheed, F.; Seager, R.

844,"Examining the burden of opioid prescribing for non-cancer pain considering socio-economic differences, in Wales. A retrospective database study examining trends between 2005 and 2015","Objectives: To use a proxy-measure of oral morphine equivalent dose (OMED) to determine trends in opioid burden in people with non-cancer pain and explore differences related to deprivation status. Design, setting and participants: Retrospective cohort study using cross-sectional and longitudinal trend analyses of opioid prescribing data from 78% of Welsh Primary Care General Practices, whose data is shared with the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage (SAIL) databank. Anonymised data for the period 2005 to 2015, for people aged 18 or over, without a recorded cancer diagnosis and who received at least one prescription for an opioid medicine was included. Primary and Secondary outcomes: A proxy-measure of oral morphine equivalence dose (OMED) was used to describe trends in opioid burden over the study period. OMED burden was stratified by 8 drug groups and deprivation, based on the quintile measures of the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation 2011 (WIMD2011). Result: In the 11 years examined, 22 641 424 prescriptions for opioids were issued from 345 primary care general practices in Wales. Daily OMED per 1000 population increased by 94.7% (from 16 266 mg to 31 665 mg). Twenty-eight percent of opioid prescribing occurred in the most deprived quintile. More than 100 000 000mg more OMED was prescribed in the most deprived areas of Wales, compared to the least deprived. Codeine prescribing accounted for 35% of the OMED burden in Wales over the study period. Conclusions: Whilst opioid prescription numbers increased 44% between 2005 and 2015, the OMED burden nearly doubled, with a disproportionate OMED load in the most deprived communities in Wales. Using OMED provides an insightful representation of opioid burden, more so than prescription numbers alone. Socio-economic differences are likely to affect pain presentation, access to support services and increase the likelihood of receiving an opioid prescription.","Davies, E.; Sewell, B.; Jones, M.; Phillips, C.; Rance, J.",20191129,"Pain Medicine","10.1101/19012625",1,"Emma Davies","Swansea University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012625v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012625v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"Dataset available from the Dryad repository, DOI: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.1rn8pk0pf"
794,"Temperature-related disasters in Europe - a cross-sectional analysis of the emergency events database from a pediatric perspective","This study investigates patterns of extreme temperature-related events in Europe and its significance for the public health, with a focus on the vulnerable pediatric population. A generalized additive model of average surface temperature development for the European countries is described and discussed with an in-depth analysis of the influence of temperature on evolutional and behavioral aspects. Methods: Extreme temperature related events are recorded in the publicly available epidemiological database of Emergency Events (EM-DAT). A comparative and descriptive statistical analysis of this data was conducted with a focus on (prospective) records from 1988 onwards. Average surface temperature data was provided by the World Bank's Climate Change Knowledge Portal. The criteria for strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology (STROBE) were respected. Results: Within EM-DAT, extreme temperature-related disasters in Europe were categorized as either heat waves, drought, forest or land fires, or cold waves and severe winter conditions, accordingly. The most frequent type of event recorded were cold waves (36.2%). However, cold waves and severe winter conditions only accounted for about 6,460 casualties (4.4%), while heat waves were responsible for a total of 137,533 casualties (95.1%). During the prospective observational period of the EM-DAT database, heat waves in 2003, 2006, 2010, and 2015, claimed a total of 119,760 casualties. These most severe heatwaves were geographically distributed over Russia (2010), as well as France, Italy, Spain, and Germany, each in 2003. Accordingly, analysis of temperature data revealed an increasing average surface temperature for all assessed European countries, correlating with in an increasing frequency of extreme temperature-related events. Conclusion: This study shows that according to EM-DAT data extreme temperatures are an increasingly important public health threat to the European population as the average European surface temperatures are rising. Although cold waves are more frequently reported in EM-DAT, heat waves are the major cause for temperature-related casualties. Therefore, we conclude that evolutional and cultural resilience against cold and drought is significantly higher than it is against heat. Our results project that the frequency, duration and intensity of heat waves will further increase due to current climatic changes and become a more prevalent problem for future generations. Hence, we propose an emergency plan to inform the public and authorities about measurements to be taken in such extreme heat conditions to overcome the prevailing lack of information available to the public.","Brennenstuhl, H.; Will, M.; Ries, E.; Mechler, K.; Garbade, S.; Ries, M.",20191122,"Public And Global Health","10.1101/19012633",1,"Markus Ries","Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012633v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012633v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in this article (and its Supplementary Information files)."
916,"Impact and cost-effectiveness of nonavalent human papillomavirus vaccination in Switzerland: insights from a dynamic transmission model","AIM: In Switzerland, human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination has been implemented using a quadrivalent vaccine that covers HPV types 16 and 18, responsible for about 70% of cervical cancer. The average national uptake was 56% in girls by the age of 16 years in 2014-2016. A nonavalent vaccine, covering five additional oncogenic HPV types was recommended at the end of 2018. The primary aim of this study was to assess the impact and cost-effectiveness of introducing the nonavalent HPV vaccine in Switzerland compared with the quadrivalent vaccine. METHODS: We developed a dynamic transmission model that describes the spread of 10 high risk HPV types. We informed the model with Swiss data about sexual behaviour and cervical cancer screening, and calibrated the model to cervical cancer incidence in Switzerland. We modelled the impact of quadrivalent and nonavalent vaccines at the achieved (56%) and national recommended uptake (80%) in girls. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) between the nonavalent vaccine, the quadrivalent vaccine and no vaccination. We evaluated costs linked to cervical cancer screening, treatment of different disease stages and vaccination in a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Compared with quadrivalent HPV vaccination in Switzerland at 56% uptake, vaccinating with the nonavalent vaccine would avert 1,175 cervical cancer deaths, 3,641 cases of cervical cancer and 106,898 CIN treatments over 100 years at 56% uptake. Compared with the quadrivalent vaccine, which would prevent an estimated 67% and 72% of cervical cancer cases at 56% and 80% coverage, the nonavalent vaccine would prevent 83% and 89% of all cervical cancers at the same coverage rates. The sensitivity analysis shows that introducing the nonavalent vaccination should improve health outcomes and offers a cost-saving alternative to the quadrivalent vaccine under the current price difference. CONCLUSIONS: All scenarios with quadrivalent and nonavalent vaccination are likely to be cost-effective compared with no vaccination. Switching to the nonavalent vaccine at current and improved vaccination uptake is likely to be cost-saving under the investigated price difference.","Riesen, M.; Bogaards, J. A.; Low, N.; Althaus, C.

800,"Boosting Chinese healthcare service providers utilization of behavioural and pharmacotherapy interventions for cigarette smoking cessation by WeChat WeQuit program","Introduction: In China, standard smoking cessation practices are rarely used by healthcare service providers (HSPs). WeChat, a popular social media app, has been widely used in China. Methods: In this single-blind, randomized trial, undertaken in China with 8-week interventions and follow-up to 52 weeks, about 2,200 providers from different health care settings will be randomly selected to the intervention or control group. This trial will be conducted in China between June 2018 to October 2019. The intervention group will receive regular smoking cessation training program messages by the professional team to 8 weeks and follow to 52 weeks. A hard copy of the manual will be sent to each provider from the intervention group by mail after randomization. The Control group will only communicate by themselves and receive thanks messages for 8 weeks, and follow-up to 52 weeks. The trial will be carried out in two phases. The first phase is the pilot study (n=200, 8-week intervention and follow-up to 16 weeks) and the second is the main study (n=2000, 8-week intervention and follow-up to 52 weeks). The primary outcome measure will be the utilization rate of behavioural and pharmacotherapy interventions for smoking patients from 8 to 52 weeks. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT03556774). Conclusions: This program will be the first evidence-based educational program in smoking cessation designed specifically for the improvement of Chinese HSPs utilization of behavioural and pharmacotherapy interventions for cigarette smoking cessation in health care settings by the WeChat WeQuit program. Implications: This protocol may show that WeChat WeQuit training program will be effective in increasing the provision of effective tobacco cessation interventions by Chinese-speaking HSPs, especially therapists, to patients with cigarette smoking, which will provide valuable insights into bridging the gap between need and services for smoking cessation in China. Overall, we believe this program will be likely to have very substantial public health benefits if it would provide a widely accessible and efficacious smoking cessation information for Chinese HSPs.","Liao, Y.",20191122,"Addiction Medicine","10.1101/19012682",1,"Yanhui Liao","Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012682v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012682v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"No data yet."

We identified 558 autosomal and 10 X-chromosome T2D-associated variants, of which 286 autosomal and 7 X-chromosome variants were previously unreported. Ancestry-specific analyses identified 25 additional novel T2D-susceptibility variants. Transcriptome-wide association analysis detected 3,568 T2D-associations with T2D-colocalized genetically predicted gene expression of 804 genes in 52 tissues, of which 687 are novel. Fifty-four of these genes are known to interact with FDA-approved drugs and chemical compounds. T2D polygenic risk score was strongly associated with increased the risk of T2D-related retinopathy, and additionally showed evidence for association with chronic kidney disease (CKD), neuropathy, and peripheral artery disease (PAD). We investigated the genetic etiology of T2D-related vascular outcomes in the MVP and observed statistical SNP-T2D interactions at 13 variants, including 3 for coronary heart disease, 1 for PAD, 2 for stroke, 4 for retinopathy, 2 for CKD, and 1 for neuropathy. Our findings may identify potential novel therapeutic targets for T2D and genomic pathways that link T2D and its vascular outcomes.","Vujkovic, M.; Keaton, J. M.; Lynch, J. A.; Miller, D.

831,"Algorithmic discovery of dynamic models from infectious disease data","Theoretical models are typically developed through a deductive process where a researcher formulates a system of dynamic equations from hypothesized mechanisms. Recent advances in algorithmic methods can discover dynamic models inductively--directly from data. Most previous research has tested these methods by rediscovering models from synthetic data generated by the already known model. Here we apply Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to discover mechanistic equations for disease dynamics from case notification data for measles, chickenpox, and rubella. The discovered models provide a good qualitative fit to the observed dynamics for all three diseases, However, the SINDy chickenpox model appears to overfit the empirical data, and recovering qualitatively correct rubella dynamics requires using power spectral density in the goodness-of-fit criterion. When SINDy uses a library of second-order functions, the discovered models tend to include mass action incidence and a seasonally varying transmission rate--a common feature of existing epidemiological models for childhood infectious diseases. We also find that the SINDy measles model is capable of out-of-sample prediction of a dynamical regime shift in measles case notification data. These results demonstrate the potential for algorithmic model discovery to enrich scientific understanding by providing a complementary approach to developing theoretical models.","Horrocks, J.; Bauch, C.

823,"Estimating the Per-Application Effectiveness of Chlorhexidine Gluconate and Mupirocin in Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Decolonization in Intensive Care Units","Introduction: Chlorhexidine gluconate and mupirocin are widely used to decolonize patientswith methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and reduce risks of infection in hospitalized populations. The probability that a treated patient would be decolonized, which we term per-application effectiveness, is difficult to directly measure. Quantifying the efficacy of per-application effectiveness of CHG and mupirocin is important for studies evaluating alternative decolonization strategies or schedules as well as identifying whether there is room for improved decolonizing agents. Methods: Using a stochastic compartmental model of an intensive care unit (ICU), the per-application effectiveness of chlorhexidine and mupirocin were estimated using approximate Bayesian computation. Extended sensitivity analysis examined the potential impact of a latent period between MRSA colonization and detection, the timing of decolonization administration, and parameter uncertainty. Results: The estimated per-application effectiveness of chlorhexidine was 0.15 (95% Credible Interval: 0.01, 0.42), while the estimated effectiveness of mupirocin was is 0.15 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.54). A lag in colonization detection markedly reduced both estimates, which were particularly sensitive to the value to the modeled contact rate between nurses and patients. Gaps longer than 24-hours in the administration of decolonizing agents still resulted in substantial reduction of within-ICU MRSA transmission. Discussion: The per-application effectiveness estimates for chlorhexidine and mupirocin suggest there is room for substantial improvement in anti-MRSA disinfectants, either in the compounds themselves, or in their delivery mechanism. Despite these estimates, these agents are robust to delays in administration, which may help in alleviating concerns over patient comfort or toxicity.","Lofgren, E. T.; Mietchen, M. S.; Short, C.

830,"The impact of public health interventions on the future prevalence of ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae:a population based mathematical modelling study","Background: Extended-spectrum betalactamase (ESBL-) producing K. pneumoniae is one of the most common causes of infections with antimicrobial resistant bacteria worldwide. The spread of colonization of humans with this pathogen is on the rise. The future prevalence of colonization with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, and the potential of public health interventions to lower it, remain uncertain. Methods: Based on detailed data on antimicrobial consumption and susceptibility systematically recorded for over 13 years in a Swiss region, we developed a mathematical model to i) reconstruct the observed course of colonization with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae; and ii) to assess the potential impact of public health interventions on future trends in colonization. Results: Simulated prevalence of colonization with ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae stabilized in the near future when rates of antimicrobial consumption and in-hospital transmission remained stable in the main analyses (simulated prevalence in 2025 was 5.3% (5.0%-9.1%) in hospitals and 2.7% (2.1%-4.6%) in the community versus 5.6% (5.1%-9.5%) and 2.8% (2.2%-5.0%) in 2019). The largest changes in future prevalence were observed in simulations that assumed changes in overall antimicrobial consumption. When overall antimicrobial consumption was set to decrease by 50%, prevalence in 2025 declined by 89% in hospitals and by 84% in the community. A 50% decline in transmission rate within hospitals led to a reduction in prevalence of 43% in hospitals and of 13% in the community by 2025. Prevalence changed much less (<9%) across scenarios with reduced carbapenem consumption. Assuming higher rates for the contribution from external sources of colonization, led to decreasing estimations of future prevalence in hospitals. While high uncertainty remains on the magnitude of these contribution, the best model fit suggested that as much as 46% (95% CI: 12%-96 %) of observed colonizations could be attributable to sources other than human-to-human transmission within the geographical setting (i.e., non-local transmission). Conclusions: This study suggests that overall antimicrobial consumption will be, by far, the most powerful driver of future prevalence and that a large fraction of colonizations could be attributed to non-local transmission.","Salzar-Vizcaya, L.; Atkinson, A.; Kronenberg, A.; Pluess, C.; Kouyos, R.; Kachalov, V.; Troillet, N.; Marschall, J.; Sommerstein, R.",20191127,"Infectious Diseases","10.1101/19012765",1,"Rami Sommerstein","Bern University Hospital","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012765v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012765v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"Available upon request: http://www.anresis.ch/"
793,"Aberrant effective connectivity is associated with positive symptoms in first-episode schizophrenia","Schizophrenia is a tenacious psychiatric disorder thought to result from synaptic dysfunction. While symptomatology is traditionally divided into positive and negative symptoms, abnormal social cognition is now recognized a key component of schizophrenia. Nonetheless, we are still lacking a mechanistic understanding of how aberrant synaptic connectivity is expressed in schizophrenia during social perception and how it relates to positive and negative symptomatology. We used fMRI and dynamic causal modelling (DCM) to test for abnormalities in synaptic efficacy in twenty-four patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES) compared to twenty-five matched controls performing the Human Connectome Project (HCP) social cognition paradigm. Patients had not received regular therapeutic antipsychotics, but were not completely drug naive. Our data reveal an increase in excitatory feedforward connectivity from motion-sensitive V5 to posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) in patients compared to matched controls. At the same time, were less accurate than controls in judging social stimuli from non-social stimuli. Crucially, patients with a higher degree of positive symptoms had more disinhibition within pSTS, a region computationally involved in Theory of Mind. We interpret these within a predictive coding framework where increased feedforward connectivity may encode aberrant prediction errors from V5 to hierarchically higher pSTS and local disinhibition within pSTS may reflect aberrant encoding of the precision of cortical representations about social stimuli.","Dietz, M.

802,"Far from MCAR: obtaining population-level estimates of HIV viral suppression","Background: Population-level estimates of disease prevalence and control are needed to assess the effectiveness of prevention and treatment strategies. However, available data are often subject to differential missingness. Consider population-level HIV viral suppression: proportion of all HIV-positive persons who are suppressing viral replication. Individuals with measured HIV status, and, among HIV-positive individuals, those with measured viral suppression are likely to differ from those without such measurements. Methods: We discuss three sets of assumptions sufficient to identify population-level suppression over time in the intervention arm of the SEARCH Study (NCT01864603), a community randomized trial in rural Kenya and Uganda (2013-2017). Using data on nearly 100,000 participants, we compare estimates from an unadjusted approach assuming data are missing-completely-at-random (MCAR); stratification on age group, sex, and community; and, targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) with Super Learner to adjust for baseline and time-updated predictors of measurement. Results: Despite high annual coverage of testing, estimates of population-level viral suppression varied by identification assumption. Unadjusted estimates were most optimistic: 50% of HIV-positive persons suppressed at baseline, 80% at Year 1, 85% at Year 2, and 85% at Year 3. Stratification on baseline predictors yielded slightly lower estimates, and full adjustment reduced estimates further: 42% of HIV-positive persons suppressed at baseline, 71% at Year 1, 76% at Year 2, and 79% at Year 3. Conclusions: Estimation of population-level disease burden and treatment coverage require appropriate adjustment for missingness. Even in ""Big Data"" settings, estimates relying on the MCAR assumption or baseline stratification should be interpreted with caution.","Balzer, L.

803,"Accurate influenza forecasts using type-specific incidence data for small geographical units","Influenza incidence forecasting is used to facilitate better health system planning and could potentially be used to allow at-risk individuals to modify their behavior. For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) runs an annual competition to forecast influenza-like illness (ILI) at the regional and national levels in the US, based on a standard discretized incidence scale. Here, we use a suite of forecasting models to analyze type-specific incidence at the smaller spatial scale of clusters of nearby counties. We used data from point-of-care (POC) diagnostic machines over three seasons, in 10 clusters, capturing: 57 counties; 1,061,891 total specimens; and 173,909 specimens positive for Influenza A. Total specimens were closely correlated with comparable CDC ILI data. Mechanistic models were substantially more accurate when forecasting influenza A positive POC data than total specimen POC data, especially at longer lead times. Also, models that fit individual counties separately were better able to forecast clusters than were models that directly fit to aggregated cluster data. Public health authorities may wish to consider developing forecasting pipelines for type-specific POC data in addition to ILI data. Simple mechanistic models will likely improve forecast accuracy when applied at small spatial scales to pathogen-specific data before being scaled to larger geographical units and broader syndromic data. Highly local forecasts may enable new public health messaging to encourage at-risk individuals to temporarily reduce their social mixing.","Turtle, J.; Riley, P.; Ben-Nun, M.; Riley, S.",20191122,"Epidemiology","10.1101/19012807",1,"Steven Riley","Predictive Science In, Imperial College London","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012807v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012807v1.full.pdf","cc_by",NA,"All weekly incidence data for the smallest spatial unit (counties) are available immediately from the authors for non-commercial use in a format that can be used immediately with the forecasting tools used to generate these results.

796,"Access to internet, smartphone usage, and acceptability of mobile health technology among cancer patients","Purpose: The use of mobile health (mHealth) technologies to augment patient care, enables providers to communicate remotely with patients enhancing the quality of care and patient engagement. Few studies addressed barriers to its implementation, especially in medically underserved populations. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 151 cancer patients was conducted at an academic medical center in the United States. A trained interviewer performed structured interviews regarding the barriers and facilitators of current and desired utilization of technology for healthcare services. Results: Of the 151 participants, 35.8% were male and ages ranged from 21-104 years. Only 73.5% of participants currently have daily access to internet, and 68.2% currently own a smartphone capable of displaying mobile applications. Among all participants, utilization of a daily mHealth application was significantly higher in patients with a college-level degree (OR; 2.78, p<0.01) and lower in older patients (OR; 0.05, p<0.01). Differences in utilization when adjusted for current smartphone use and daily access to internet were nonsignificant. Among smartphone users, the desire to increase cancer knowledge was associated with a higher likelihood of utilizing a mHealth application (OR; 261.53, p<0.01). Conclusion: The study suggests the access to mobile technology is the predominant determinant of utilization. Healthcare organizations should consider these factors when launching patient engagement platforms.","Potdar, R.; Thomas, A.; Dimeglio, M.; Mohiuddin, K.; Djibo, D.

832,"Influenza-associated mortality for circulatory and respiratory causes during the 2013-2014 through the 2018-2019 influenza seasons in Russia","Background: Information on influenza-associated mortality in Russia is limited and largely related to deaths with influenza in the diagnosis that represent a small fraction of all influenza-associated deaths. Methods: Using previously developed methodology (Goldstein et al., Epidemiology 2012), we regressed the monthly rates of mortality for respiratory causes, as well as circulatory causes (available from the Russian Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat)) during the 2013/14 through the 2018/19 influenza seasons linearly against the monthly proxies for the incidence of influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B (obtained using data from the Smorodintsev Research Institute of Influenza (RII) on influenza/ARI consultations, testing of respiratory specimens and genetic/antigenic characterization of influenza viruses), adjusting for the baseline rates of mortality not associated with influenza circulation and temporal trends. Results: For the 2013/14 through the 2018/19 seasons, influenza circulation was associated with an average annual 17636 (95% CI (9482,25790)) deaths for circulatory causes and 4179 (3250,5109) deaths for respiratory causes, with the largest number of deaths (32298 (18071,46525) for circulatory causes and 6689 (5019,8359) for respiratory causes) estimated during the 2014/15 influenza season. Influenza A/H3N2 was responsible for 51.8% of all circulatory influenza-associated deaths and 37.2% of all respiratory influenza-associated deaths. Influenza A/H1N1 was responsible for 23.4% of all circulatory influenza-associated deaths and 29.5% of all respiratory influenza-associated deaths. Influenza B was responsible for 24.9% of all circulatory influenza-associated deaths and 33.3% of all respiratory influenza-associated deaths, with the overwhelming majority of those deaths being caused by the B/Yamagata viruses. Compared to the 2013/14 through the 2015/16 seasons, during the 2016/17 through the 2018/19 seasons (when levels of influenza vaccination were significantly higher), the volume of influenza-associated mortality declined by about 16.1%, or 3809 annual respiratory and circulatory deaths. Conclusions: Influenza circulation is associated with a substantial mortality burden in Russia, particularly for circulatory deaths, with some reduction in mortality rates observed following the major increase in influenza vaccination coverage. Those results support the potential utility of further extending the levels of influenza vaccination, the use of quadrivalent influenza vaccines, and extra efforts for protecting individuals with circulatory disease in Russia, including vaccination and the use of antiviral medications.","Goldstein, E.",20191127,"Epidemiology","10.1101/19012856",1,"Edward Goldstein","Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012856v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19012856v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nd","10.17513/mjpfi.12945","The manuscript is based on aggregate, publicly available data

835,"Individual differences in the course of youth depression: The importance of renitence and reversion","Studies of developmental trajectories of depression are important for understanding its etiology. Existing studies have been limited by short time frames and no studies have explored a key factor: differential patterns of responding to life events. This paper introduces a novel analytic technique, growth mixture modeling with structured residuals, to examine the course of youth depression symptoms in a large, prospective cohort (N=11,641, ages 4-16.5). Age-specific critical points were identified at ages 10 and 13 where depression symptoms spiked for a minority of children. However, most depression risk was due to dynamic responses to environmental events, drawn not from a small pool of persistently depressed children, but a larger pool of children who varied across higher and lower symptom levels.","Hawrilenko, M.; Masyn, K.

801,"Stereotactic arrhythmia radioablation for refractory scar-related ventricular tachycardia","Background: Stereotactic radiosurgery is a form of radiotherapy that is performed in a single session and focuses high-dose ionizing radiation beams from a collimated radiation source to a small, localized area of the body. Recently, stereotactic radiosurgery has been applied to arrhythmias (stereotactic arrhythmia radioablation - STAR), with promising results reported in patients with refractory, scar-related ventricular tachycardia (VT), a cohort with known high morbidity and mortality. Objective: Herein, we describe our experience with the use of CyberKnife, a frameless image-guided linear accelerator stereotactic radiosurgery system, in conjunction with CardioPlan, a cardiac specific radiotherapy planning software, to treat patients with scar-related VT, detailing its early and mid- to long-term results. Methods: This is a pilot, prospective study of patients undergoing STAR for refractory VT. The anatomical target for radioablation was defined based on the clinical VT morphology, electroanatomical mapping, and study-specific pre-procedural imaging with cardiac computed tomography. The target volume delineated with the aid of CardioPlan was treated with a prescription radiation dose of 25 Gy delivered in a single fraction by CyberKnife in an outpatient setting. Ventricular arrhythmias and radiation-related adverse events were monitored at follow-up to determine STAR efficacy and safety. Result: Five patients (100 % male, 63 {+/-} 12 years old, 80 % ischemic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular ejection fraction 34 {+/-} 15 %) with refractory VT underwent STAR between January and June 2018. Radioablation was delivered in 82 {+/-} 11 minutes without acute complications. During a mean follow-up of 12 {+/-} 2 months, all patients experienced clinically significant mid- to late-term ventricular arrhythmia recurrence; two patients died of complications associated with their advanced heart failure. There were no clinical or imaging evidence of radiation necrosis or other radiation-induced complications in the organs at risk surrounding the scar targeted by radioablation. Conclusion: Despite good initial results, STAR did not result in effective ventricular arrhythmia control in the long term in a selected, high-risk population of patients with scar-related VT. The safety profile was confirmed to be favorable, with no radiation-related complications observed during follow-up. Further studies are needed to explain these disappointing results.","Gianni, C.; Rivera, D.; Burkhardt, J.

812,"Common health conditions in childhood and adolescence, school absence, and educational attainment: Mendelian randomization study","Objectives: To assess the causal relationship of different health conditions in childhood and adolescence with educational attainment and school absence. Design: Longitudinal observational study and Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses. Setting: Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a population sample of children from South-West England born in 1991-1992. Participants: 6113 unrelated children with available GCSE records and genetic data (50% female). Exposures: Six common health conditions with known genetic markers measured at age 10 (primary school) and 13 (mid-secondary school). These were: symptoms of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), depression, asthma, migraines and BMI. Genetic liability for these conditions and BMI was indexed by polygenic scores. Main outcome measures: Educational attainment at age 16 (total GCSE and equivalents points score), school absence at age 14-16. Results: In multivariate-adjusted observational models, all health conditions except asthma and migraines were associated with poorer educational attainment and greater school absence. Substantial mediation by school absence was seen for BMI (e.g. 35.6% for BMI at 13) and migraines (67% at age 10), with more modest mediation for behavioural and neurodevelopmental measures of health. In genetic models, a unit increase in genetically instrumented BMI z-score at age 10 predicted a 0.19 S.D. decrease (95% CI: -0.28 to -0.11) in attainment at 16, equivalent to around a 1/3 grade difference in each subject. It also predicted 8.6% more school absence (95% CI:1.3%, 16.5%). Similar associations were seen for BMI at age 13. Consistent with previous work, genetic liability for ADHD predicted lower educational attainment, but did not clearly increase school absence. Conclusions: Triangulation across multiple approaches supported a causal, negative influence of higher BMI on educational attainment and school absence. Further research is required to understand the mechanisms linking higher BMI with school absence and attainment.","Hughes, A.; Wade, K. H.; Rice, F.; Dickson, M.; Davies, A.; Davies, N.

833,"A Cognitive Development Chart for School-age Children and Adolescents","Objective: To evaluate the reliability and predictive utility of a time-efficient cognitive development chart that seeks to identify children and adolescents with high-risk for multiple outcomes such as mental health problems, substance use, and educational difficulties. Method: We analyzed data from the Brazilian High-Risk Cohort for Psychiatric Disorders (HRC), a longitudinal school-based study conducted from 2010-2011 to 2013-2014. Participants were 2,239 children and adolescents, 6 to 17 years of age, who completed the cognitive assessment at baseline. The task used to track cognitive development was the Two Choice Reaction Time task (<3 minutes of duration, computer-based), which assesses the accuracy and speed of perceptual decision-making. Mental health, substance use, and educational outcomes were assessed by validated standardized methods. Key variables were measured at baseline and 3-year follow-up. The predictive utility was assessed using static (deviations from the age-expected performance at baseline) and dynamic (deviations from the age-expected change in performance over time) indicators. Results: The reliability of the task parameter was high (intra-class correlation coefficient = 0.8). Static indicators of cognitive development significantly predicted concurrent mental, intellectual and educational difficulties, as well as incident and persistent educational difficulties and substance use in the 3-year follow-up. Dynamic indicators predicted persistent mental health problems. Conclusion: Primary-care and mental health professionals need a time-efficient tool for tracking deviations from age-expected cognitive development, which predicts multiple unwanted outcomes at the same time. If replicated, future results could support the generation of tools for tracking risk for mental health, substance use, and educational difficulties.","Simioni, A. R.; Pine, D.; Sato, J. R.; Pan, P.

811,"Identifying the drivers of multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae at a European level","Beta-lactam- and in particular carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae represent a major public health threat. Despite strong variation of resistance across geographical settings, there is limited understanding of the underlying drivers. To assess these drivers, we developed a transmission model of cephalosporin- and carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. The model is parameterized using antibiotic consumption and demographic data from eleven European countries and fitted to the resistance rates for Klebsiella pneumoniae for these settings. The impact of potential drivers of resistance is then assessed in counterfactual analyses. Based on reported consumption data, the model could simultaneously fit the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing and carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL and CRK) across eleven European countries over eleven years. The fit could explain the large between-country variability of resistance in terms of consumption patterns and fitted differences in hospital transmission rates. Based on this fit, a counterfactual analysis found that reducing nosocomial transmission and antibiotic consumption in the hospital had the strongest impact on ESBL and CRK prevalence. Antibiotic consumption in the community also affected ESBL prevalence but its relative impact was weaker than nosocomial consumption. Finally, we used the model to estimate a moderate fitness cost of CRK and ESBL at the population level. This work highlights the disproportionate role of antibiotic consumption in the hospital and of nosocomial transmission for resistance in gram-negative bacteria at a European level. This indicates that infection control and antibiotic stewardship measures should play a major role in limiting resistance even at the national or regional level.","Kachalov, V.

834,"Electrophysiological Studies of Reception of Facial Communication in Autism Spectrum Disorder and Schizophrenia","Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SZ) are both characterized by difficulty with social cognition. Likewise, social brain activity is atypical in both disorders and indicates atypical reception of facial communication, a key area in the Research Domain Criteria framework for identifying common biological underpinnings of psychiatric disorders. To identify areas of overlap and dissociation between ASD and SZ, this paper reviews studies of electrophysiological (EEG) response to facial stimuli across ASD and SZ populations. We focus on findings regarding amplitude and latency of four brain responses implicated in social perception: P100, N170, N250, and P300. There were many inconsistent findings in both the ASD and SZ literatures; however, replication across studies was strongest for delayed N170 latency in ASD and attenuated N170 amplitude in SZ. EEG responses corresponded with clinical symptoms in multiple samples. These results highlight the challenges associated with replicating research findings in heterogeneous clinical populations, as well as the need for transdiagnostic research and for designing studies to examine relationships among continuous quantifications of behavior and neural activity across neurodevelopmental disorders.","Levy, E.

853,"The Project for Objective Measures Using Computational Psychiatry Technology (PROMPT): Rationale, Design, and Methodology","Background: Depressive and neurocognitive disorders are debilitating conditions that account for the leading causes of years lived with disability worldwide. Overcoming these disorders is an extremely important public health problem today. However, there are no biomarkers that are objective or easy-to-obtain in daily clinical practice, which leads to difficulties in assessing treatment response and developing new drugs. Due to advances in technology, it has become possible to quantify important features that clinicians perceive as reflective of disorder severity. Such features include facial expressions, phonic/speech information, body motion, daily activity, and sleep. The overall goal of this proposed study, the Project for Objective Measures Using Computational Psychiatry Technology (PROMPT), is to develop objective, noninvasive, and easy-to-use biomarkers for assessing the severity of depressive and neurocognitive disorders. Methods: This is a multi-center prospective study. DSM-5 criteria for major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and major and minor neurocognitive disorders are inclusion criteria for the depressive and neurocognitive disorder samples. Healthy samples are confirmed to have no history of psychiatric disorders by Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview, and have no current cognitive decline based on the Mini Mental State Examination. Participants go through approximately 10-minute interviews with a psychiatrist/psychologist, where participants talk about non-specific topics such as everyday living, symptoms of disease, hobbies, etc. Interviews are recorded using RGB and infrared cameras, and an array microphone. As an option, participants are asked to wear wrist-band type devices during the observational period. The interviews take place [&le;]10 times within up to five years of follow-up. Various software is used to process the raw video, voice, infrared, and wearable device data. A machine learning approach is used to predict the presence of symptoms, severity, and the improvement/deterioration of symptoms. Discussion: The PROMPT goal is to develop objective digital biomarkers for assessing the severity of depressive and neurocognitive disorders in the hopes of guiding decision-making in clinical settings as well as reducing the risk of clinical trial failure. Challenges may include the large variability of samples, which makes it difficult to extract the features that commonly reflect disorder severity.

836,"An application of machine learning to assist medication order review by pharmacists in a health care center","The objective of this study was to determine if it is feasible to use machine learning to evaluate how a medication order is contextually appropriate for a patient, in order to assist order review by pharmacists. A neural network was constructed using as input the sequence of word2vec embeddings of the 30 previous orders, as well as the currently active medications, pharmacological classes and ordering department, to predict the next order. The model was trained with data from 2013 to 2017, optimized using 5-fold cross-validation, and tested on orders from 2018. A survey was developed to obtain pharmacist ratings on a sample of 20 orders, which were compared with predictions. The training set included 1 022 272 orders. The test set included 95 310 orders. Baseline training set top 1, top 10 and top 30 accuracy using a dummy classifier were respectively 4.5\%, 23.6\% and 44.1\%. Final test set accuracies were, respectively, 44.4\%, 69.9\% and 80.4\%. Populations in which the model performed the best were obstetrics and gynecology patients and newborn babies (either in or out of neonatal intensive care). Pharmacists agreed poorly on their ratings of sampled orders with a Fleiss kappa of 0.283. The breakdown of metrics by population showed better performance in patients following less variable order patterns, indicating potential usefulness in triaging routine orders to less extensive pharmacist review. We conclude that machine learning has potential for helping pharmacists review medication orders. Future studies should aim at evaluating the clinical benefits of using such a model in practice.","Thibault, M.; Lebel, D.",20191127,"Health Informatics","10.1101/19013029",1,"Maxime Thibault","CHU Sainte-Justine","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19013029v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19013029v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc",NA,"The dataset used for this study may be accessed under a data sharing agreement.

839,"Adopting a new model of care for treating patients with chronic limb threatening ischaemia: early results of a vascular limb salvage clinic","Background Vascular limb salvage services can potentially improve outcomes for patients with chronic limb threatening ischaemia (CLTI) and/or diabetic foot ulceration (DFU). This study aims to evaluate the early outcomes for a vascular limb salvage (VaLS) clinic and investigate times-to-treatment. Methods A retrospective analysis involving all patients diagnosed with CLTI/DFU within the VaLS clinic from February 2018-February 2019 was undertaken. Data were compared to two comparator cohorts; patients managed prior to the clinic, between May 2017-February 2018 (Pre-Clinic (PC)), and patients managed outside of clinic, between February 2018-February 2019 (Alternative Pathways (AP)). Major amputation at 12 months was the primary outcome. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and adjusted Coxs proportional hazard models were utilised to compare outcomes. Results Six-hundred and forty-six patients (VaLS=200, PC=252, AP=194) were included (median age=73 years, median follow-up=365 days). Within the VaLS clinic, patients underwent assessment within a median of 2.1[IQR 1.3-3.1] days from referral. No differences in median time from assessment to treatment were identified (VaLS=6.1[3.9-11.1] vs. AP=5.7[2.6-12.9] days, p=.394; VaLS vs. PC=6.1[2.8-22.8] days, p=.888). The VaLS cohort had a significantly lower rate of major amputation at 12 months (9.5%) compared to both the AP (19.6%, aHR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24-0.74, p=.003) and the PC (19.4%; aHR 0.45, 95% CI 0.27-0.78, p=.004) cohorts, after adjustment for potential confounding. Conclusions A limb salvage clinic can help reduce the rate of major amputation and provides a model which delivers timely vascular assessment. Whilst early outcomes are promising, further evaluation is required to assess longer-term outcomes and reduce time-to-treatment.","Nickinson, A. T.

When change scores are regressed onto initial impairments, the resulting slope is approximately 0.7 for a variety of outcomes. These findings have led to the 70% ""proportional recovery rule"" and the argument that proportional recovery represents a biological phenomenon. Previous studies of proportional recovery are confounded by statistical limitations that come from regressing change scores onto initial impairments in bounded scales. Objective. Our goal is to show that data claimed as evidence for proportional recovery are generally consistent with random patterns of recovery, once statistical limitations are taken into account. Methods. Using a pooled dataset of N=373 Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) upper extremity scores extracted from published literature, we ran simulations to illustrate three main arguments: (1) Mathematical coupling renders the traditional null-hypothesis significance test irrelevant in proportional recovery studies; (2) Proportional recovery is one of many alternative hypotheses; (3) Current evidence claimed in favor of proportional recovery is consistent with uniform random recovery. Results. Our simulations show that if all data were included (no exclusion of ""non-fitters"") regressing change scores onto initial impairments in a bounded scale would lead to a slope of 0.5. Similarly, cluster analysis will spuriously identify groups of fitters and non-fitters, leading to a slope for the fitters of 0.7, when the underlying recovery is random. Conclusions. These results cast doubt on the validity of ""proportional recovery"" as a population level-statistic and a biological phenomenon.","Lohse, K. R.; Hawe, R.; Dukelow, S.; Scott, S.

837,"A Metabolomics Approach for Early Prediction of Vincristine-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy","Vincristine is a core chemotherapeutic drug administered to pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. Despite its efficacy in treating leukemia, it can lead to severe peripheral neuropathy in a subgroup of the patients. Peripheral neuropathy is a debilitating and painful side-effect that can severely impact an individual's quality of life. Currently, there are no established predictors of peripheral neuropathy incidence during the early stage of chemotherapeutic treatment. As a result, patients who are not susceptible to peripheral neuropathy may receive sub-therapeutic treatment due to an empirical upper cap on the dose, while others may experience severe neuropathy at the same dose. Contrary to previous genomics based approaches, we employed a metabolomics approach to identify small sets of metabolites that can be used to predict a patient's susceptibility to peripheral neuropathy at different time points during the treatment. Using those identified metabolites, we developed a novel strategy to predict peripheral neuropathy and subsequently adjust the vincristine dose accordingly. In accordance with this novel strategy, we created a free user-friendly tool, VIPNp, for physicians to easily implement our prediction strategy. Our results showed that focusing on metabolites, which encompasses both genotypic and phenotypic variations, can enable early prediction of peripheral neuropathy in pediatric leukemia patients.","Verma, P.; Devaraj, J.; Skiles, J.

845,"Polygenic background modifies penetrance of monogenic variants conferring risk for coronary artery disease, breast cancer, or colorectal cancer","Background: Genetic variation can predispose to disease both through (i) monogenic risk variants in specific genes that disrupt a specific physiologic pathway and have a large effect on disease risk and (ii) polygenic risk that involves large numbers of variants of small effect that affect many different pathways. Few studies have explored the interaction between monogenic risk variants and polygenic risk. Methods: We identified monogenic risk variants and calculated polygenic scores for three diseases, coronary artery disease, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer, in three study populations - case-control cohorts for coronary artery disease (UK Biobank; N=12,879) and breast cancer (Color Genomics; N=19,264), and an independent cohort of 49,738 additional UK Biobank participants. Results: In the coronary artery disease case-control cohort, increased risk for carriers of a monogenic variant ranged from 1.3-fold for those in the lowest polygenic score quintile to 12.6-fold for those in the highest. For breast cancer, increased risk ranged from 2.4 to 6.9-fold across polygenic score quintiles. Among the 49,738 UK Biobank participants who carried a monogenic risk variant, the probability of disease at age 75 years was strongly modified by polygenic risk. Across individuals in the lowest to highest percentiles of polygenic risk, the probability of disease ranged from 17% to 78% for coronary artery disease; 13% to 76% for breast cancer; and 11% to 80% for colon cancer. Conclusions: For three important genomic conditions, polygenic risk powerfully modifies the risk conferred by monogenic risk variants.","Fahed, A. C.; Wang, M.; Homburger, J. R.; Patel, A.

851,"Metagenomic analysis of common intestinal diseases reveals relationships among microbial signatures and powers multi-disease diagnostic models","Intestinal diseases can share clinical symptoms and gut microbiome alterations, necessitating cross-disease comparisons and the use of multi-disease models. Here, we performed meta-analyses on fecal metagenomes of Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and colorectal cancer (CRC), and identified 65 marker species and 74 marker pathways that were significantly altered in >=2 studies of the same disease. We grouped marker species by their co-occurrences into disease-specific and mixed clusters according to whether all the cluster members belong to the same disease, and revealed their distinct phylogenetic relationships: species in disease-specific clusters are phylogenetically related, while those in mixed clusters are more distant; strikingly, UC- and CRC-specific species are phylogenetically closer than to CD-specific ones, likely because UC-patients have higher risk of CRC. Consistent to their phylogenetic relationships, marker species had similar within-cluster and different between-cluster metabolic preferences. In CD and CRC, most marker species correlated with an indicator of leaky gut, suggesting a link between gut dysbiosis and human derived contents. In fact, our results suggested that due to physio-metabolic alterations, the diseased gut may represent a stressed environment and pose stronger selection to gut microbes; consequently, marker species in diseases showed more coordinated changes than the controls. With the marker species and pathways, we constructed three high-performance (including multi-disease) models with AUROC of 0.88 and true positive rates up to 89%, and explained their putative clinical applications. Together, our results improved our understanding on the relationships among common intestinal diseases, and strongly support the feasibility of metagenome-based multi-disease diagnosis.","Jiang, P.; Wu, S.; Zhao, X.-M.; Chen, W.",20191129,"Gastroenterology","10.1101/19013136",1,"Weihua Chen","Huazhong University of Science and Technology","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19013136v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19013136v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"Correspondence and requests for materials should be addressed to W.H.C. and X.M.Z.."
868,"Impact of a city-wide school-located influenza vaccination program over four years on vaccination coverage, school absences, and laboratory-confirmed influenza: a prospective matched cohort study","Background: It is estimated that vaccinating 50-70% of school-aged children for influenza can produce population-wide indirect effects. We evaluated a city-wide, school-located influenza vaccination (SLIV) intervention that aimed to increase influenza vaccination coverage. The intervention was implemented in over 95 pre-schools and elementary schools in northern California from 2014 to 2018. Using a matched prospective cohort design, we estimated intervention impacts on student influenza vaccination coverage, school absenteeism, and community-wide indirect effects on laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations. Methods and Findings: We used a multivariate matching algorithm to identify a nearby comparison school district with similar pre-intervention characteristics and matched schools in each district. To measure student influenza vaccination, we conducted cross-sectional surveys of student caregivers in 22 school pairs (2016 survey N = 6,070; 2017 survey N = 6,507). We estimated the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalization from 2011-2018 using surveillance data from school district zip codes. We analyzed student absenteeism data from 2011-2018 from each district (N = 42,487,816 student-days). To account for pre-intervention differences between districts, we estimated difference-in-differences (DID) in influenza hospitalization incidence and absenteeism rates using generalized linear and log-linear models with a population offset for incidence outcomes. The number of students vaccinated by the SLIV intervention ranged from 7,502 to 10,106 (22-28% of eligible students) each year. During the intervention, influenza vaccination coverage among elementary students was 53-66% in the comparison district. Coverage was similar between the intervention and comparison districts in 2014-15 and 2015-16 and was significantly higher in the intervention site in 2016-17 (7% 95% CI 4, 11) and 2017-18 (11% 95% CI 7, 15). During seasons when vaccination coverage was higher among intervention schools and the vaccine was moderately effective, there was evidence of statistically significant indirect effects: adjusting for pre-intervention differences between districts, the reduction in influenza hospitalizations in the intervention site was 76 (95% CI 20, 133) in 2016-17 and 165 (95% CI 86, 243) in 2017-18 among non-elementary school aged individuals and 327 (5, 659) in 2016-17 and 715 (236, 1195) in 2017-18 among adults 65 years or older. The reduction in illness-related school absences during influenza season was 3,538 (95% CI 709, 6,366) in 2016-17 and 8,249 (95% CI 3,213, 13,285) in 2017-18. Limitations of this study include the use of an observational design, which may be subject to unmeasured confounding, and caregiver-reported vaccination status, which is subject to poor recall and low response rates. Conclusion: A city-wide SLIV intervention in a large, diverse urban population decreased the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalization in all age groups and decreased illness-specific school absence rates among students during seasons when the vaccine was moderately effective, suggesting that the intervention produced indirect effects. Our findings suggest that in populations with moderately high background levels of influenza vaccination coverage, SLIV programs can further increase coverage and reduce influenza across communities.","Benjamin-Chung, J.; Arnold, B.

855,"Quality of life in cancer patients treated with mistletoe: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: Mistletoe extracts are used as an adjunct therapy for cancer patients, but there is dissent as to whether this therapy has a positive impact on quality of life (QoL). Methods: We conducted a systematic review searching in several databases (Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Science Citation Index, clinicaltrials.gov, opengrey.org) by combining terms that cover the fields of 'neoplasm', 'quality of life' and 'mistletoe'. We included prospective controlled trials that compared mistletoe extracts with a control in cancer patients and reported QoL or related dimensions. The quality of the studies was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool version 2.We conducted a quantitative meta-analysis. Results: We included 26 publications with 30 data sets. The studies were heterogeneous. The pooled standardized mean difference (random effects model) for global QoL after treatment with mistletoe extracts vs. control was d = 0.61 (95% CI 0.41-0.81; p<0,001). The effect was stronger for younger patients, with longer treatment, in studies with lower risk of bias, in randomized and blinded studies. Sensitivity analyses support the validity of the finding. 50% of the QoL subdomains (e.g. pain, nausea) show a significant improvement after mistletoe treatment. Most studies have a high risk of bias or at least raise some concern. Conclusion: Mistletoe extracts produce a significant, medium-sized effect on QoL in cancer. Risk of bias in the analyzed studies is likely due to the specific type of treatment, which is difficult to blind; yet this risk is unlikely to affect the outcome.","Loef, M.; Walach, H.",20191129,"Oncology","10.1101/19013177",1,"Harald Walach","Poznan University of Medical Sciences","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19013177v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19013177v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nd",NA,"Data will be made available on publication and are available for review purposes on request from the authors."
852,"Multimodal neuroimaging and suicidality in a US population-based sample of school-aged children","Importance: Suicide deaths and suicidality are considered a public health emergency, yet their brain underpinnings remain elusive. Objective: To examine individual, environmental, and clinical characteristics, as well as multimodal brain imaging correlates of suicidality in a US population-based sample of school-aged children. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of the first wave of data from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study Setting: Multicenter population-based study Participants: Children aged 9-10 years from unreferred, community samples with suicidality data available (n=7,994). Following quality control, we examined structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) (n=6,238), resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) (n=4,134), and task-based fMRI (range n=4,075 to 4,608). Exposure: Lifetime suicidality, defined as suicidal ideation, plans and attempts reported by children or/and caregivers. Main Outcomes and Measures: Multimodal neuroimaging analyses examined differences with Welch t-test and Equivalence Tests, with observed effect sizes (ES, Cohen d) and their 90% confidence interval (CI) < |0.15|. Predictive values were examined using the area under precision-recall curves (AUPRC). Measures included, cortical volume and thickness, large-scale network connectivity and task-based MRI of reward processing, inhibitory control and working memory. Results: Among the 7,994 unrelated children (3,757 females [47.0%]), those will lifetime suicidality based on children (n=684 [8.6%]; 276 females [40.4%]), caregiver (n=654 [8.2%]; 233 females [35.6%]) or concordant reports (n=198 [2.5%]; 67 females [33.8%]), presented higher levels of social adversity and psychopathology on themselves and their caregivers compared to never-suicidal children (n=6,854 [85.7%]; 3,315 females [48.3%]). A wide range of brain areas was associated with suicidality, but only one test (0.06%) survived statistical correction: children with caregiver-reported suicidality had a thinner left bank of the superior temporal sulcus compared to never-suicidal children (ES=-0.17, 95%CI -0.26, -0.08, pFDR=0.019). Based on the prespecified bounds of |0.15|, ~48% of the group mean differences for child-reported suicidality comparisons and a ~22% for parent-reported suicidality comparisons were considered equivalent. All observed ES were relatively small (d[&le;]|0.20|) and with low predictive value (AUPRC[&le;]0.10). Conclusion and Relevance: Using commonly-applied neuroimaging measures, we were unable to find a discrete brain signature related to suicidality in youth. There is a great need for improved approaches to the neurobiology of suicide.","Vidal-Ribas, P.; Janiri, D.; Doucet, G. E.; Pornpattananangkul, N.; Nielson, D.

861,"The role of synovial T-cell infiltration following knee joint injury in symptoms and progression to osteoarthritis","Objectives: Identification of osteoarthritis(OA)-specific synovial inflammatory pathways, and when in the clinical course they are active, is critical for their utility as therapeutic targets. We directly compared the mononuclear inflammatory/immune-cell responses following joint injury that does and does-not lead to OA, to define bona-fide OA-associated cellular events. Methods: We undertook detailed temporal flow-cytometric and mRNA expression analysis in mice after sham or medial-meniscal-destiblization (DMM) surgery. We compared this with patients with meniscal injury and OA, and evaluated the role of synovial monocytes/macrophages versus lymphocytes in catabolic metalloproteinase secrection in vitro. We determined the effect of transient acute or delayed systemic T-cell depletion on DMM-induced OA pathology. Results: OA-inducing/DMM and non-OA-inducing/Sham surgery had identical synovial monocyte/macrophage number, activation and polarization. The number and activation of synovial (not splenic or peripheral-blood) CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes was increased from 1-day after DMM versus Sham, and showed a persistent cyclical elevation throughout OA onset and progression. There was a temporal imbalance in synovial Th17/Treg and Th1/Th2 lymphocytes during DMM-induced OA initiation and progression. We confirmed early post-injury and late-OA CD3/CD8 T-cell responses in synovial tissues from patients, identified an association between CD8 and early post-injury symptoms, and defined a significant role for CD3+T-cells in synovial metalloproteinase secretion. Anti-CD3 cell-depletion studies in mice confirmed a key role for the earliest post-injury T-cell response in long-term OA pathology. Conclusions: We identify a hitherto unappreciated pathophysiological role of acute T-cell activation after joint injury in long-term post-traumatic OA risk, providing a novel diagnostic and therapeutic target.","Moradi, B.; Jackson, M.

862,"Current practice and challenges in screening for visual perception deficits after stroke: a qualitative study","AIM: We aimed to document current clinical practice and needs in screening for visual perception problems after stroke to inform development of new screening tools. METHODS: We interviewed 25 health care professionals (12 occupational therapists, 13 orthoptists) from 16 organisations in England. Interviews were transcribed and coded in NVivo Software. Data were thematically analysed using the Value Proposition Canvas, a model which establishes what people want to achieve, the challenges they face and what facilitates their jobs. RESULTS: Participants' understanding of visual perception varied and often included sensory and cognitive deficits. Occupational therapists commonly screened for visual field deficits and hemispatial neglect, while other aspects of visual cognition were rarely assessed. They decided on referrals to orthoptists for further assessment. Screening generally occurred during functional assessments and/or with in-house developed tools. Challenges to practice were: lack of time, lack of training, environmental and stroke survivor factors (e.g. aphasia), insufficient continuation of care, and test characteristics (e.g. not evidence-based). Facilitators to practice were: quick and practical tools, experienced staff or tools with minimal training requirements, a streamlined care pathway between a stroke unit and eye hospital supported by occupational therapists and orthoptists. CONCLUSION: Screening employs non-standardised assessments and rarely covers visual perceptual deficits in higher order perception. Our service evaluation demonstrates the need for a standardised visual perception screen, which should ideally be 15 minutes or less, be portable, and require minimal equipment. The screen should be suitable for bedside testing in noisy environments, inclusive for participants with aphasia and evidence-based.","Vancleef, K.; Colwell, M.

879,"Word embeddings trained on published case reports are lightweight,effective for clinical tasks, and free of protected health information","Rationale: Word embeddings are used to create vector representations of text data but not all embeddings appropriately capture clinical information, are free of protected health information, and are computationally accessible to most researchers. Methods: We trained word embeddings on published case reports because their language mimics that of clinical notes, the manuscripts are already de-identified by virtue of being published, and the corpus is much smaller than those trained on large, publicly available datasets. We tested the performance of these embeddings across five clinically relevant tasks and compared the results to embeddings trained on a large Wikipedia corpus, all publicly available manuscripts, notes from the MIMIC-III database using fastText, GloVe, and word2vec, and using different dimensions. Tasks included clinical applications of lexicographic coverage, semantic similarity, clustering purity, linguistic regularity, and mortality prediction. **Results:** The embeddings trained using the published case reports performed as well as if not better on most tasks than those using other corpora. The embeddings trained using all published manuscripts had the most consistent performance across all tasks and required a corpus with 100 times as many tokens as the corpus comprised of only case reports. Embeddings trained on the MIMIC-III dataset had small but marginally better scores on the clustering tasks which was also based on clinical notes from the MIMIC-III dataset. Embeddings trained on the Wikipedia corpus, although containing almost twice as many tokens as all available published manuscripts, performed poorly compared to those trained on medical and clinical corpora. **Conclusion:** Word embeddings trained on freely available published case reports performed well for most clinical task, are free of protected health information, and are small compared to commonly used embeddings trained on larger clinical and non-clinical corpora. The optimal corpus, dimension size, and which embedding model to use for a given task involves tradeoffs in privacy, reproducibility, performance, and computational resources.","Flamholz, Z.

859,"Schizophrenia polygenic risk score and cannabis use modify psychosis expression in first episode psychosis patients and population controls","Background Diagnostic categories within the psychosis spectrum are widely used in clinical practice, however psychosis may occur on a continuum. Therefore, we explored whether the continuous distribution of psychotic symptoms across categories is a function of genetic as well as environmental risk factors, such as polygenic risk scores (PRSs) and cannabis use. Methods As part of the EU-GEI study, we genotyped first episode psychosis patients (FEP) and population controls, for whom transdiagnostic dimensions of psychotic symptoms or experiences were generated using item response bi-factor modelling. Linear regression was used, separately in patients and controls, to test the associations between these dimensions and schizophrenia (SZ) PRSs, as well as the combined effect of SZ-PRS and cannabis use on the positive symptom/experience dimensions. Results SZ-PRS was associated with negative (B=0.18; 95%CI 0.03 to 0.34) and positive (B=0.19; 95%CI 0.03 to 0.36) symptom dimensions in 617 FEP, and with all the psychotic experience dimensions in 979 controls. The putative effect of SZ-PRS on either symptom or experience dimensions was of a small magnitude. Cannabis use was additionally associated with the positive dimensions both in FEP (B=0.31; 95%CI 0.11 to 0.52) and in controls (B=0.26; 95%CI 0.06 to 0.46), independently from SZ-PRS. Conclusions We report two validators to the latent dimensional structure of psychosis. SZ risk variants and cannabis use independently map onto specific dimensions, contributing to variation across the psychosis continuum. Findings support the hypothesis that psychotic experiences have similar biological substrates as clinical disorders.","Quattrone, D.; Reininghaus, U.; Richards, A.

858,"Social and Health Seeking Determinants of Antibiotic Use in Vietnamese Children Under 5: Analysis of National Household Survey Data","Background Antibiotic resistance is an important global public health issue, perpetuated by increases in antibiotic use. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), tackling antibiotic resistance bacteria is especially challenging. Due to high rates of infectious disease and continuing high mortality from untreated bacterial infections, policy must balance tackling both antibiotic access and antibiotic overuse. This paper investigates the social and health-seeking determinants that impact appropriate and inappropriate antibiotic use in Vietnamese children under 5 for Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI). Methods Descriptive analyses and logistic regression models were performed on country-wide household data from UNICEF Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys in 2006, 2011, 2014. Results Results show that antibiotic overuse is higher in those who sought care from a healthcare provider than those who self-treated. In 2014, children who sought care at private facilities and government facilities were more likely to overuse antibiotics for mild respiratory infections (OR 6.1 and OR 3.8 respectively) than those who did not seek care at private and government facilities respectively. Furthermore, higher socioeconomic level was associated with both appropriate antibiotic use for pneumonia and inappropriate for mild ARI. Children in the poorest households in 2011 and 2014 were less likely to appropriately use antibiotics than those from other socioeconomic levels (OR 0.37 and 0.025 respectively). And children in the poorest households in 2014 were less likely to inappropriately use antibiotics for mild ARI than all other socioeconomic levels (OR 0.36). Conclusions These findings support, challenge, and broaden current understandings of antibiotic usage in Vietnam. Our results suggest that inappropriate antibiotic use arises from the provider and institutional level. Consequently, we argue that community education efforts and enforcing antibiotics as prescription-only is insufficient. Instead, more focus should be made on reducing financial incentives and infrastructural weaknesses at hospitals and health centres.

897,"A preliminary report on alcohol-associated DNA methylation and suicidal behavior: evidence using Mendelian randomization","Alcohol consumption, a risk factor for suicide, is associated with changes in DNA methylation, which may play a role in the pathophysiology of suicidality. Here, Mendelian randomization probes whether alcohol-associated changes in DNA methylation mediate risk for suicidal behavior. The results suggest that higher alcohol-associated DNA methylation levels at cg18120259 confer a weak causal effect. cg18120259 is instrumented by a cis-methylation quantitative trait locus (rs9472155) that is upstream of VEGFA and associated with circulating VEFG levels. To ascertain whether the cg18120259 finding is confounded by VEGF levels, a Mendelian randomization of VEGF levels on suicidality was performed, revealing a null effect. This implies circulating VEGF levels (observed among suicide attempters) may mark but not cause suicide. Both mechanisms should be re-examined in large replication studies, as the information might be harnessed for early detection of at-risk individuals and possibly save lives.","Adams, C.

857,"Quantitative Analysis of Ablation Technique Predicts Arrhythmia Recurrence Following Atrial Fibrillation Ablation","Background: Optimal ablation technique, including catheter-tissue contact during atrial fibrillation (AF) radiofrequency (RF) ablation is associated with improved procedural outcomes. We used a custom developed software to analyze high frequency catheter position data to study the interaction between catheter excursion during lesion placement, lesion-set sequentiality and arrhythmia recurrence. Methods: 100 consecutive patients undergoing first time RF ablation for paroxysmal AF were analyzed. Spatial positioning of the ablation catheter sampled at 60 Hz during RF application was extracted from the CARTO3 system (Biosense Webster Inc., USA) and analyzed using custom developed MATLAB software to determine precise catheter spatial 3D excursion during RF ablation. The primary end point was freedom from atrial arrhythmia lasting longer than 30 seconds after a single ablation procedure. Results: At one year, 86% of patients were free from recurrent arrhythmia. There was no significant difference in clinical, echocardiographic or ablation characteristics between patients with and without recurrent arrhythmia. Analyzing 15,356,998 position data-points revealed that lesion-set sequentiality and mean lesion catheter excursion were predictors of arrhythmia recurrence. Analyzing arrhythmia recurrence by mean single-lesion catheter excursion (excursion > 2.81mm) and by sequentiality (using 46% of lesions with inter-lesion distance >6mm as cutoff) revealed significantly increased arrhythmia recurrence in the higher excursion group (23% vs. 6%, p=0.03) and in the less sequential group (24% vs. 4%, p=0.02). Conclusion: Ablation lesion sequentiality measured by catheter inter-lesion distance and catheter stability measured by catheter excursion during lesion placement are potentially modifiable factors affecting arrhythmia recurrence after RF ablation for AF.","Jankelson, L.; Dai, M.; Bernstein, S.; Park, D.; Holmes, D.; Aizer, A.; Chinitz, L.; Barbhaiya, C.",20191129,"Cardiovascular Medicine","10.1101/19013318",1,"Lior Jankelson","NYU School of Medicine","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19013318v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19013318v1.full.pdf","cc_no","10.1016/j.ahj.2019.11.011","Data is available"
856,"The care of older adults with extreme obesity in nursing homes: A collective case study","Objective: To establishthe preparednessof nursing homes to deliver high quality, safe and equitable bariatric carefor older adults with extreme obesity. Design and methods: A collective case study approach was used. Data collection included observational and interview data from three nursing homes, and a review of 224,200 resident admissions over a 3-year period in New Zealand. Participants: Twenty eight health care workers from three nursing homes in the North Island of New Zealand. Results: Despite a willingness by healthcare staff to care for older adults with extreme obesity, nursing homes were not well equipped to provide safe equitable care for this resident population. Key areas of concern for nursing homes related to limitations in the infrastructure, and financial barriers relating to government funded contracted care services which incorporated equipment procurement and safe staffing ratios. Conclusion: Nursing homes are unprepared to accommodate the existing and increasing number of older adults with extreme obesity who will require bariatric specific care. Government agencies and policy makers will need to consider the financial implications of the increasing need for bariatric level support within aged care, as well as the impact on individual nursing home resources and quality of care provided. Considerable sector and government attention is needed in relation to infrastructure and funding, to allow for the provision of high quality, safe and equitable care for this population group.","Hales, C.; Amankwaa, I.; Gray, L.; Rook, H.",20191129,"Health Systems And Quality Improvement","10.1101/19013326",1,"Caz Hales","Victoria University of Wellington","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19013326v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19013326v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"No data is publicly available"
860,"Interpreting chest X-rays via CNNs that exploit disease dependencies and uncertainty labels","Chest radiography is one of the most common types of diagnostic radiology exams, which is critical for screening and diagnosis of many different thoracic diseases. Specialized algorithms have been developed to detect several specific pathologies such as lung nodule or lung cancer. However, accurately detecting the presence of multiple diseases from chest X-rays (CXRs) is still a challenging task. This paper presents a supervised multi-label classification framework based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for predicting the risk of 14 common thoracic diseases. We tackle this problem by training state-of-the-art CNNs that exploit dependencies among abnormality labels. We also propose to use the label smoothing technique for a better handling of uncertain samples, which occupy a significant portion of almost every CXR dataset. Our model is trained on over 200,000 CXRs of the recently released CheXpert dataset and achieves a mean area under the curve (AUC) of 0.940 in predicting 5 selected pathologies from the validation set. This is the highest AUC score yet reported to date. The proposed method is also evaluated on the independent test set of the CheXpert competition, which is composed of 500 CXR studies annotated by a panel of 5 experienced radiologists. The performance is on average better than 2.6 out of 3 other individual radiologists with a mean AUC of 0.930, which ranks first on the CheXpert leaderboard at the time of writing this paper.","Pham, H.

899,"A novel methodology to measure waiting times for community-based specialist care in a public healthcare system","Background: Monitoring of waiting time (WT) in healthcare systems is essential, since long WT are associated with adverse health outcomes, reduced patient satisfaction and increased private financing. Objective: To develop a methodology for routine national monitoring of WT for community-based non-urgent specialist appointments, in a public healthcare system. Design: Observational historical study using data from computerized appointment scheduling systems of all Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) in Israel. Data sources: Data included available appointments for community-based specialists and actual number of visits. The first 50 available appointments from each specialist appointment book were collected throughout December 2018. Five most frequently visited specialties - orthopedics, ophthalmology, gynecology, dermatology and otolaryngology - were included. Data collection/extraction approach: WT offered to HMO members (OWT) were calculated for two scenarios:  specific physician and  any physician in the clinic's geographical region. Distribution of OWT was calculated separately for each specialty and geographical region, combined to create the nationwide distribution, and expressed as mean, standard deviation and percentiles. Principal findings: Estimated national median OWT for ""specific"" physician, ranged from 6 days (ophthalmology) to 13 days (dermatology), with large variation between geographic regions. OWT for  any physician were 28-50% shorter than for  specific physician. Conclusions: This novel method offers a solution for ongoing national WT measurement, using computerized scheduling systems. It integrates patient preferences for physician choice and allows identification of differences between specialties and regions, setting the ground for interventions to strengthen public healthcare systems.","Wilf Miron, R.; Novikov, I.; Ziv, A.; Mandelbaum, A.; Ritov, Y.; Luxenburg, O.",20191209,"Health Systems And Quality Improvement","10.1101/19013367",1,"Rachel Wilf Miron","Gertner Institue of Epidemiology & Health Policy Research","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19013367v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19013367v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"Data is available upon request"
854,"Predicting dengue importation into Europe, using machine learning and model-agnostic methods.","The geographical spread of dengue is a global public health concern. This is largely mediated by the importation of dengue from endemic to non-endemic areas via the increasing connectivity of the global air transport network. The dynamic nature and intrinsic heterogeneity of the air transport network make it challenging to predict dengue importation. Here, we explore the capabilities of state of the art machine learning algorithms to predict dengue importation. We trained four machine learning classifiers algorithms, using a 6-year historical dengue importation data for 21 countries in Europe and connectivity indices mediating importation and air transport network centrality measures. Predictive performance for the classifiers was evaluated using the area under the receiving operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, and specificity measures. Finally, we applied practical model agnostic methods, to provide an in-depth explanation of our optimal model's predictions on a global and local scale. Our best performing model achieved high predictive accuracy, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic score of 0.94 and a maximized sensitivity score of 0.88. The predictor variables identified as most important were the source country's dengue incidence rate, population size, and volume of air passengers. Network centrality measures, describing the positioning of European countries within the air travel network, were also influential to the predictions. We demonstrated the high predictive performance of a machine learning model in predicting dengue importation and the utility of the model-agnostic methods to offer a comprehensive understanding of the reasons behind the predictions. Similar approaches can be utilized in the development of an operational early warning surveillance system for dengue importation.","Salami, D.; Sousa, C. A.; Martins, M. D. R.

872,"Evaluation of Prognostic Utility of Tumor Mutation Burden for Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) response to Immune Checkpoint Blockade Therapy: A Single Institute Study","IMPORTANCE: The role of Tumor Mutation Burden (TMB) as a prognostic and/or predictive biomarker for Immune Checkpoint Blockade (ICB) therapy in a real-world clinical setting is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether TMB status provided by a clinically and commercially available tumor genomic profiling (TGP) assay is associated with overall survival of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with ICB from a single institute. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Outcomes and genetic testing data were collected for 188 NSCLC patients treated within the Cleveland Clinic system between August 2012 and July 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall survival (OS) from time receiving ICB therapy. RESULTS: Among 188 patients with NSCLC (median age, 62 years; 49.5% female), 86 (45.7%) received ICB therapy. Patients were grouped into three categories based on the status of TMB (in mutations/Mb): high (>= 20/Mb), intermediate (>=5 to <= 20/Mb), and low (<5/Mb). In patients treated with ICB, TMB high status was not significantly associated with improved OS from therapy initiation (HR: 0.90 [95% CI, 0.52-2.49, P>0.8], median OS difference: 9.7 months). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients with NSCLC from a single institute with a longitudinal database of clinical data including TGP results, exploratory analyses do not show statistical significance for the prognostic utility of TMB. These findings indicate that there is a need for more prospective data on the use of TMB status as a guide for ICB therapy in a routine care setting.","Clemenceau, J. R.; Lee, S.

873,"Using a genetic risk score to estimate the earliest age of Alzheimer's disease-related physiologic change in Body Mass Index","Abstract Objectives: Weight loss is common in the years before an Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, likely due to changes in appetite and diet. The age at which this change in body mass index (BMI) emerges is unclear but may point to the earliest manifestations of AD, timing that may be important for identifying windows of intervention or risk reduction. We examined the association between AD genetic risk and cross-sectional BMI across adults in mid- to late-life as an innovative approach to determine the age at which BMI changes and may indicate preclinical AD. Design: Observational study Setting: UK Biobank Participants: 407,386 UK Biobank non-demented participants aged 39-70 with Caucasian genetic ancestry enrolled 2007-2010. Main Outcome Measures: BMI (kg/m2) was constructed from height and weight measured during the initial visit. A genetic risk score for AD (AD-GRS) was calculated as a weighted sum of 23 genetic variants previously confirmed to be genome-wide significant predictors of AD (Z-scored). We evaluated whether the association of AD-GRS with BMI differed by age using linear regression with adjustment for sex and genetic ancestry, stratified by age grouping (40-60, 61+). We calculated the earliest age at which high AD-GRS predicted divergence in BMI compared to normal age-related BMI trends with linear and quadratic terms for age and interactions with AD-GRS. Results: In 39-49 year olds, AD-GRS was not significantly associated with lower BMI (0.00 kg/m2 per SD in AD-GRS; 95%CI: -0.03,0.03). In 50-59 year olds AD-GRS was associated with lower BMI (-0.03 kg/m2 per 1 SD in AD-GRS; 95%CI:-0.06,-0.01) and this association was stronger in 60-70 year olds (-0.09 kg/m2 per 1 SD in AD-GRS; 95%CI:-0.12,-0.07). Model-based BMI age-curves for people with high versus low AD-GRS scores began to diverge after age 47. Interpretation: Genetic factors that increase AD risk begin to predict lower BMI in adults by age 50, with greater effect later in older ages. Weight loss may manifest as an early pathophysiologic change associated with AD.","Brenowitz, W.; Zimmerman, S.; Filshtein, T.; Yaffe, K.; Walter, S.; Hoffmann, T.; Jorgenson, E.; Whitmer, R.; Glymour, M.",20191204,"Epidemiology","10.1101/19013441",1,"Willa Brenowitz","UCSF","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19013441v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19013441v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"Researchers can apply to UK Biobank (www.ukbiobank.ac.uk) to access the data used in this study.

871,"Left frontal white matter atrophy links to timing mechanisms relevant for apraxia of speech","Objective: In some patients with apraxia of speech (AOS), we observed impaired perceptual timing abilities, which lead us to propose a shared mechanism of impaired perceptual timing underlying impaired rhythm discrimination (perceptual processing) and AOS (motor speech output). Given that considerable white matter damage is often observed in these patients, we here investigate whether white matter changes are related to impaired rhythm processing as one possible mechanism underlying AOS. Methods: We applied deformation-based morphometry (DBM) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 12 patients with the nonfluent variant (NFV) of Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) with AOS, as well as 11 patients with the semantic variant and 24 controls. Results: Seventy-five percent of the patients with NFV displayed impaired rhythm processing and the severity of their impairment correlated with their degree of AOS. Moreover, left frontal white matter volume loss adjacent to the supplementary motor area (SMA) correlated with impaired rhythm processing. In addition, we obtained tract-based metrics of the left Aslant tract, which is typically damaged in NFV. The structural integrity of the left Aslant tract also correlated with rhythmic discrimination abilities in NFV. Conclusions: Our data suggest that a shared white matter substrate adjacent to the SMA contributes to impaired rhythm perception and motor speech impairments. This indicates that impaired perceptual timing may be one of the neurocomputational mechanisms underlying AOS. Our observation that regional variations in left frontal lobe atrophy are linked to the phenotypical heterogeneity in NFV may lead the way for earlier diagnosis.","Bruffaerts, R.; Schaeverbeke, J.; Grube, M.; Gabel, S.; De Weer, A.-S.; Dries, E.; Van Bouwel, K.; Griffiths, T.; Sunaert, S.; Vandenberghe, R.",20191204,"Neurology","10.1101/19013458",1,"Rose Bruffaerts","KU Leuven","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19013458v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19013458v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request."
876,"Cortical complexity analyses and their cognitive correlate in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia","The changes of cortical structure in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are usually described in terms of atrophy. However, neurodegenerative diseases may also affect the complexity of cortical shape, such as the fractal dimension of the brain surface. Thirty-two people with symptomatic AD-pathology (clinically probable AD, n=18, and amyloid-positive mild cognitive impairment, n=14), 24 with FTD and 28 healthy controls underwent high-resolution 3T structural brain MRI. Using surface-based morphometry, we created vertex-wise cortical thickness and fractal dimension maps for group comparisons and correlations with cognitive measures in AD and FTD. In addition to the well-established pattern of cortical thinning encompassing temporoparietal regions in AD and frontotemporal areas in FTD (FDR p < 0.05), we observed reductions of fractal dimension specifically involving precuneus and posterior cingulate for AD and orbitofrontal cortex and insula for FTD. Correlational analyses between fractal dimension and cognition showed that these regions were particularly vulnerable with regards to memory and language impairment in both AD and FTD. This study demonstrates a distinct pattern of fractal dimension impairment and correlation with cognition. Further studies are required to assess cortical complexity measures at earlier disease stages (e.g. in prodromal/ asymptomatic carriers of FTD-related gene mutations) to assess whether fractal dimension represents a sensitive imaging marker for prevention and diagnostic strategies.","Nicastro, N.; Malpetti, M.; Cope, T.

Objectives The aim of this study was to determine the association between volcanic SO2 gases on general population respiratory health in the Icelandic capital area some 250 km from the eruption site. Methods Respiratory health outcomes were: asthma medication dispensing (AMD) from the Icelandic Medicines Register, medical doctor consultations in primary care (PCMD) and hospital emergency department visits (HED) in Reykjavik (population: 215 000) for respiratory disease from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2014. The associations between daily counts of health events, and daily mean SO2 concentration and high SO2 levels (24-hour mean SO2 >125{nu}g/m3) were analyzed using generalized additive models. Results After the eruption began, AMD was higher than before (129.4 vs. 158.4 individuals per day, p<0.05). Increases in SO2 concentration were associated with an estimated increase in AMD by 1.05% (95% CI 0.48 - 1.62%) per 10 {nu}g/m3 at lag 0-2, 1.51% (95% CI 0.63 - 2.40%) increase in individuals under 18 years of age. PCMD for respiratory causes increased by 1.52% (95% CI 1.04 - 2.00%) per 10 {nu}g/m3 SO2 at lag 0-2. For HED, only effect estimated for individuals aged 64 years and older were significantly increased, by 1.541% (95% CI 0.02 - 3.07%) per 10 {nu}g/m3 SO2 at lag 0-2. Following days with SO2 levels above 125 {nu}g/m3, AMD and PCMD were increased in all age groups, in AMD mostly so in individuals under 18 by 20.4%(95%CI 4.8 - 23.4%), and adult PCMD visits by 24.1%(95%CI 16.8 - 31.3%). HED was significantly increased in elderly by 26.3% (95%CI 5.56-47.0). Discussion High levels of volcanic SO2 are associated with increases in dispensing of AMD, and health care utilization in primary and tertiary care. Individuals with prevalent respiratory disease may be particularly susceptible.","Carlsen, H.

880,"HIV-1 founder variant multiplicity is determined by the infection stage of the source partner","During sexual transmission, the large genetic diversity of HIV-1 within an individual is frequently reduced to one founder variant that initiates infection. Understanding the drivers of this bottleneck is crucial to develop effective infection control strategies. Genetic characteristics of the potential founder viruses and events in the recipient partner are both known to contribute to this bottleneck, but little is understood about the importance of the source partner. To test the hypothesis that the source partner affects the multiplicity of HIV founder variants, we developed a phylodynamic model calibrated using genetic and epidemiological data on all existing transmission pairs for whom the direction of transmission and the infection stage of the source partner are known. Our results demonstrate the importance of infection stage of the source partner, and not exposure route, in determining founder variant multiplicity. Specifically, acquiring infection from someone in the acute (early) stage of infection increases the risk of multiple variant transmission when compared with someone in the chronic (later) stage of infection. This study provides the first direct test of source partner characteristics to explain the low frequency of multiple founder strain infections and can inform clinical intervention study design and interpretation.","Villabona-Arenas, C.

883,"Null effect of circulating sphingomyelins on risk for breast cancer: a Mendelian randomization report using Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) data.","Background. Changes in cellular metabolism are a hallmark of cancer and are linked with sphingolipid synthesis. Due to immense interest in how sphingolipids influence chemoresistance, more is known about the impact of sphingolipids during cancer treatment and progression than about the potential role of sphingolipids in the induction of tumors in humans. Methods. Because estrogen triggers sphingolipid signaling cascades, the causal role of circulating levels of sphingomyelin (a type of sphingolipid) on breast cancer was investigated with a well-powered Mendelian randomization design. Results. The results reveal a null effect (OR = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.85, 1.05; P = 0.30). Conclusion. Despite the role sphingomyelins play during chemoresistance and cancer progression, circulating sphingomyelins do not appear to initiate or protect from breast cancer. Impact. This finding comprises the first causal report in humans that sphingomyelins on breast cancer initiation is null.

917,"Rate of Force Development is Related to Maximal Force, Muscle Quality and Physical Function in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease Predialysis","ABSTRACT Physical function is severely compromised in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and worsens with continued decreases in kidney function. Neuromuscular force capacity is a key determinant of physical function in healthy older adults, though its importance in persons with CKD is less understood. This study aimed to determine the relationships among rate of force development (RFD), muscle quality and physical function in a group of community-dwelling, middle-aged and older men (n=14; age=71.2+/-6.2 years) with CKD stages 3 and 4 (eGFR=37.5+/-10.4 ml/min per 1.73 m2). Force characteristics were determined from maximal knee extensor isometric contractions and muscle quality was estimated using ultrasound grayscale analysis. Physical function was assessed by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and 5-repetition sit-to-stand (STS). eGFR was positively related to SPPB (r=0.54, p=0.044) and inversely related to STS (r=0.62, p=0.029). RFD was positively related to SPPB at time points 0-50 ms, 50-100 ms, and 0-300 ms (RFD0-50, r=0.73, p=0.010; RFD50-100, r=0.67, p=0.022 and RFD0-300 r=0.61, p=0.045); and inversely related to STS at time points 0-50 ms, 50-100 ms, and 0-300 ms (RFD0-50, r=-0.78, p=0.007; RFD50-100, r=-0.78, p=0.006 and RFD0-300 r=-0.76, p=0.009), respectively. RFD was positively associated with maximal voluntary force (MVF) at time points 50-100 ms, 100-200 ms, and 0-300 ms (RFD50-100, r=0.72, p=0.011; RFD100-200, r=0.66, p=0.025; and RFD0-300 r=0.70, p=0.016). Neither MVF nor muscle quality was significantly associated with functional measures. These findings highlight the relationships between RFD and physical function in middle-aged and older men with CKD stages 3 and 4.","Gollie, J. M.; Harris-Love, M. O.; Patel, S. S.; Blackman, M.

878,"Independently Carriage of IL-1RN*2 Allele Associated with Increased Risk of Gastric Cancer in The Sudanese Population.","Background: Helicobacter pylori is responsible for gastric cancer in approximately tens of millions of patients. Gastric cancer in Sudan represents one of the top causing death among cancers with about 686 cases per year and a 2.7 % mortality rate. IL-1RN VNTR polymorphism has been reported to increase the risk of gastric cancer. Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the association of the 86 bp VNTR polymorphism of IL- 1RN gene and the susceptibility to H. pylori infection and gastric cancer in the Sudanese population. Materials and methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from 114 subjects. Of whom 60 had gastritis and duodenitis, 26 had a peptic ulcer, 16 had gastric cancer and 12 had normal gastroscopy findings. H. pylori infection was investigated by specific 16S rRNA. And IL-1RN VNTR polymorphism at intron 2 was genotyped using the PCR method and direct sequencing for random samples. Results: The positive H. pylori infection rate among participants was 47.37%. There is a lack of a significant difference in IL- 1RN genotype with H. pylori infection (p-value=1.0000). The IL-1 RN L/L genotype was significantly more frequent in a patient with benign disorders (gastritis or duodenitis or peptic ulcer), Odd=6.000 (95% CI =1.750-20.57, P=0.0056). While the heterozygote genotype 2/L was associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer with OR = 12.83 (95% CI = 1.261-130.6, P=0.0302). Conclusion: Independently carriage of IL-1RN *2 allele was associated with increased risk of gastric cancer in the Sudanese population. Notwithstanding the relatively small sample size of the study population, our findings show that the host genetic can be a useful tool for identifying high-risk individuals among dyspeptic patients; and also underscore the role played by host genetics in gastric carcinogenesis.

877,"The genetic and clinical landscape of nanophthalmos in an Australian cohort","Purpose: Refractive error is caused by a disparity between the axial length and focusing power of the eye. Nanophthalmos is a rare ocular abnormality in which both eyes are abnormally small, typically causing extreme hyperopic refractive error, and associated with an increased risk of angle-closure glaucoma. Methods: A cohort of 40 individuals from 13 unrelated nanophthalmos kindreds were recruited, with 11 probands subjected to exome sequencing. Results: Nine probands (69.2%) were assigned a genetic diagnosis, with variants in PRSS56 (4), MFRP (3), and previously reported variants in TMEM98 (1) and MYRF (1). Two of the four PRSS56 probands harboured the previously described c.1066dupC frameshift variant implicated in over half of all reported PRSS56 kindreds, with surrounding haplotypes distinct from each other, and from a previously reported Tunisian c.1066dupC haplotype. Individuals with a genetic diagnosis had shorter mean axial lengths (P=7.22x10-9) and more extreme hyperopia (P=0.0005) than those without a genetic diagnosis, with recessive forms associated with the shortest axial lengths and highest hyperopia. All individuals with an axial length below 18 mm in their smaller eye (17/17) were assigned a genetic diagnosis. Conclusions: These findings detail the genetic architecture of nanophthalmos in an Australian cohort of predominantly European ancestry, their relative clinical phenotypes, and highlight the shared genetic architecture of rare and common disorders of refractive error.","Siggs, O.; Awadalla, M.

875,"Alien limb in the corticobasal syndrome: phenomenological characteristics and relationship to apraxia","Alien limb refers to movements that seem purposeful but are independent of patients' reported intentions. Alien limb often co-occurs with apraxia in the corticobasal syndrome, and anatomical and phenomenological comparisons have led to the suggestion that alien limb and apraxia may be causally related as failures of goal-directed movements. Here, we characterised the nature of alien limb symptoms in patients with the corticobasal syndrome (n=30) and their relationship to limb apraxia. Twenty-five patients with progressive supranuclear palsy Richardson syndrome served as a disease-control group. Structured examinations of praxis, motor function, cognition and alien limb were undertaken in patients attending a regional specialist clinic. Twenty-eight patients with corticobasal syndrome (93%) demonstrated significant apraxia and this was often asymmetrical, with the left hand preferentially affected in 77% of patients. Moreover, 83% reported one or more symptoms consistent with alien limb. The range of these phenomena was broad, including changes in the sense of ownership and control as well as unwanted movements. Regression analyses showed no significant association between the severity of limb apraxia and both the occurrence of an alien limb and the number of alien limb phenomena reported. Bayesian estimation showed a low probability for a positive association between alien limb and apraxia, suggesting that alien limb phenomena are not likely to be related to severe apraxia. Our results shed light on the phenomenology of these disabling and as yet untreatable clinical features, with relevance to theoretical models of voluntary action.","Lewis-Smith, D.

Therefore, we aimed to establish whether rs641738 is a risk factor for NAFLD through meta-analysis. Data from 131,096 participants (7,692 with liver biopsies and 45,419 with imaging) was included in the meta-analysis. The minor T-allele of rs641738C>T was associated with higher liver fat on CT/MRI using an additive genetic model (+0.05 standard deviations [95% CI: 0.01,0.09], p=0.025), and with an increased risk of NAFLD (per-allele OR: 1.09 [95% CI: 1.01,1.17]), nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (OR: 1.11 [95% CI: 1.02,1.21]), advanced fibrosis (OR: 1.14 [95% CI: 1.05,1.23]), and hepatocellular carcinoma (OR: 1.43 [95% CI: 1.22,1.67]) in adults with NAFLD. Sub-group analysis did not demonstrate a difference in Caucasians and non-Caucasians. Rs641738C>T was not associated with markers of insulin resistance but was associated with higher risk of stroke in the UK Biobank.

887,"How do interventions impact malaria dynamics between neighboring countries? A case study with Botswana and Zimbabwe","Malaria is a vector-borne disease that is responsible for over 400,000 deaths per year. Although many countries world wide have taken measures to decrease the incidence of malaria many regions remain endemic, and in some parts of the world malaria incidence is increasing. While control efforts are largely focused at national levels, the movement of individuals between countries may complicate the efficacy of elimination efforts. Here, we consider the case of neighboring countries Botswana and Zimbabwe, connected by human mobility. Both have improved malaria rates in recent years, but are not yet reached elimination. We use a two-patch Ross-MacDonald Model with Lagrangian human mobility to examine the coupled disease dynamics between these two countries. In particular, we are interested in the impact that interventions for controlling malaria applied in one country can have on the incidence of malaria in another country. We find that dynamics and interventions in Zimbabwe can dramatically influence pathways to elimination in Botswana, largely driven by Zimbabwe's population size and larger basic reproduction number.","Agusto, F.; Goldberg, A.; Ortega, O.; Ponce, J.; Zaytseva, S.; Sindi, S.

Methods: Tremor rating scale (TRS) hemi scores were analyzed in 13 ET patients, stimulated in both the VIM and the PSA in a randomized, crossover trial. Distances of PSA and VIM contacts to population based DRTTs were calculated. The relationships between distance to DRTT and stimulation amplitude, as well as DBS efficiency (TRS improvement per amplitude) were investigated. Results: PSA contacts were closer to the DRTT (p=0.019) and led to a greater improvement in TRS hemi scores (p=0.005) than VIM contacts. Proximity to the DRTT was related to lower amplitudes (p<0.001) and higher DBS efficiency (p=0.017). Conclusions: Differences in tremor outcome and stimulation parameters between contacts in the PSA and the VIM can be explained by their different distance to the DRTT.","Dembek, T.

885,"MAKING DENSENET INTERPRETABLE A CASE STUDY IN CLINICAL RADIOLOGY","The monotonous routine of medical image analysis under tight time constraints has always led to work fatigue for many medical practitioners. Medical image interpretation can be error-prone and this can increase the risk of an incorrect procedure being recommended. While the advancement of complex deep learning models has achieved performance beyond human capability in some computer vision tasks, widespread adoption in the medical field has been held back, among other factors, by poor model interpretability and a lack of high-quality labelled data. This paper introduces a model interpretation and visualisation framework for the analysis of the feature extraction process of a deep convolutional neural network and applies it to abnormality detection using the musculoskeletal radiograph dataset (MURA, Stanford). The proposed framework provides a mechanism for interpreting DenseNet deep learning architectures. It aims to provide a deeper insight about the paths of feature generation and reasoning within a DenseNet architecture. When evaluated on MURA at abnormality detection tasks, the model interpretation framework has been shown capable of identifying limitations in the reasoning of a DenseNet architecture applied to radiography, which can in turn be ameliorated through model interpretation and visualization.","Ngan, K.

886,"Measuring Tibial Forces is More Useful than Varus-Valgus Laxities for Identifying and Correcting Overstuffing in Kinematically Aligned Total Knee Arthroplasty","Identifying and correcting varus-valgus (V-V) malalignment of the tibial component is important when balancing a kinematically aligned total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Accordingly, the primary objective was to determine whether the tibial forces or V-V laxities are more sensitive to, and thus more useful for identifying and correcting, V-V malalignments of the tibial component that overstuff a compartment. Calipered kinematically aligned TKA was performed on nine human cadaveric knees. Medial and lateral tibial forces and V-V laxities were measured from 0{degrees} to 120{degrees} flexion with an unmodified reference tibial component and modified tibial components that introduced {+/-}1{degrees} and {+/-}2{degrees} V-V malalignments from the reference component to overstuff either the medial or lateral compartment. Changes in the tibial forces were most sensitive to V-V malalignments at 0{degrees} flexion (medial = 118{+/-}34 N/deg valgus malalignment and lateral = 79{+/-}20 N/deg varus malalignment). The varus and valgus laxities were most sensitive to V-V malalignments at 30{degrees} flexion (-0.6{+/-}0.1 deg/deg varus malalignment) and 120{degrees} flexion (-0.4{+/-}0.2 deg/deg valgus malalignment), respectively. The maximum average signal-to-noise ratios of the sensitivities to changes in tibial forces and V-V laxities were 8.4 deg-1 and 0.9 deg-1, respectively, based on reported measurement errors (i.e., noise) using current intraoperative technologies (14 N and 0.7{degrees}). Because of the greater signal-to-noise ratios, measuring tibial forces is more useful than V-V laxities for identifying and correcting V-V malalignments of the tibial component that overstuff a compartment. Clinical Significance: The sensitivities of tibial forces provide objective guidance to surgeons performing V-V recuts of the tibia.","Roth, J. D.; Howell, S. M.; Hull, M.

Several factors are known to influence the HIV-1 reservoir size and decay rate on suppressive antiretroviral treatment (ART), but little is known about the role of human genetic variation. Methods We measured the reservoir size at three time points over a median of 5.4 years, and searched for associations between human genetic variation and two phenotypic readouts: the reservoir size at the first time point and its decay rate over the study period. We assessed the contribution of common genetic variants using genome-wide genotyping data from 797 patients with European ancestry enrolled in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study and searched for a potential impact of rare variants and exonic copy number variants using exome sequencing data generated in a subset of 194 study participants. Results Genome- and exome-wide analyses did not reveal any significant association with the size of the HIV-1 reservoir or its decay rate on suppressive ART. Conclusions Our results point to a limited influence of human genetics on the size of the HIV-1 reservoir and its long-term dynamics in successfully treated individuals.","Thorball, C.

889,"Interactive Psychometrics for Autism with the Human Dynamic Clamp: Interpersonal Synchrony from Sensory-motor to Socio-cognitive Domains","Background: The Human Dynamic Clamp (HDC) is a human-machine interface for studying realistic social interaction under controlled and reproducible conditions. Here, we propose to probe the validity of the HDC as psychometric instrument for quantifying social abilities in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASDs) and neurotypical development. Methods: To study behavioral synchrony, we derived from interaction with the HDC avatar, five standardized scores following a gradient from sensory-motor and motor to higher socio-cognitive skills, in a sample of 155 individuals (113 with ASDs, 42 typically developing participants; aged 5 to 25 years; IQ>70). Results: We conducted regression analyses with normative modeling on global scores according to four sub-conditions (avatar behavior ""cooperative/competitive"", human task ""in-phase/anti-phase"", diagnosis and age at inclusion). Children with ASDs tend to have significant lower scores than controls for motor skills. Independently of the phenotype, socio-cognitive skills increase with developmental age, while being affected by the ongoing task and the behavior of the avatar. Discussion: The weaker performance in participants with ASDs for motor skills suggests convergent validity for this score of the HDC during social interaction. Results provide additional evidence of a relationship between sensory-motor and socio-cognitive skills. As we found a significant main effect of age at inclusion, HDC may be used as a marker of aging of socio-cognitive skills during real-time social interaction. Conclusion: Through its standardized and objective evaluation, the HDC not only represents a valid paradigm for the study of interpersonal synchrony but also a clinically relevant psychometric instrument for the evaluation and stratification of socio-motor dysfunctions.","Baillin, F.; Lefebvre, A.; Pedoux, A.; Beauxis, Y.; Engemann, D.; Maruani, A.; Amsellem, F.; Bourgeron, T.; Delorme, R.; Dumas, G.",20191206,"Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology","10.1101/19013771",1,"Guillaume Dumas","Institut Pasteur","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19013771v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19013771v1.full.pdf","cc_by",NA,"The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are not publicly available due to restriction of ethical consents but aggregated data are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request."
893,"Prevention of bone loss and fractures following solid organ transplantations: Protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis","Purpose Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients can develop skeletal diseases caused by underlying conditions and the use of immunosuppressants. As a result, SOT recipients are at risk for decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture incidences. We propose a network meta-analysis (NMA) that incorporates all available RCT data to provide the most comprehensive ranking of antiresorptive interventions according to their ability to decrease fracture incidences and increase BMD in SOT recipients. Methods We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, CENTRAL and Chinese literature sources for RCTs, and we will include adult SOT recipients who took antiresorptive therapies starting at the time of transplant with relevant outcomes. We will perform title and full-text screening as well as data extraction in duplicate. We will report changes in BMD as weighted or standardized mean differences, and fracture incidences as risk ratios. We will use SUCRA scores to provide rankings of interventions, and we will examine the quality of evidence using risk of bias and CINeMA. Results The results of this systematic review and network meta-analysis will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. Conclusions To our knowledge, this systematic review and network meta-analysis will be the most comprehensive quantitative analysis regarding the management of bone loss and fractures in SOT recipients. Our analysis should be able to provide physicians and patients with an up-to-date recommendation for pharmacotherapies in reducing incidences of bone loss and fractures associated with SOT.","Deng, J.; Hou, W.",20191206,"Transplantation","10.1101/19013797",1,"Jiawen Deng","McMaster University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19013797v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19013797v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nd",NA,"All available data are presented in the manuscript and supplementary materials."

Methods: Using pretreatment MRIs, we manually identified 88 patients with GBM that had a significant cystic component at presentation. Results: Compared to patients with noncystic GBM (N=405), patients with cystic GBM had significantly longer overall survival and were significantly younger at presentation. However, among patients who received the current standard-of-care treatment, cystic GBM (N=40) was not significant for outcome. We also did not observe a significant survival benefit when comparing this standard-of-care cystic cohort to patients with cystic GBM diagnosed before the standard was established (N=19), but the analogous result for patients with noncystic GBM gives a sizeable benefit, as expected (N=144, N=111, respectively). We also report differences in the absolute and relative sizes of imaging abnormalities on MRI and the prognostic implication of cysts based on sex. Conclusion: Together, these results may explain later studies that note no significant survival benefit for patients with cystic GBM receiving current standard-of-care. We discuss hypotheses for these observed differences, including the possibility that the presence of a cyst could indicate a less aggressive tumor.","Curtin, L.; Whitmire, P.; Rickertsen, C.

892,"Utilization of Family Planning and Associated Factors among Reproductive Age Women with Disability in Arba Minch , Southern Ethiopia","Introduction globally, one type of contraceptive was used by around 63 percent of women. Women with disabilities account for 10 percent of all women and make up three-quarters of the disabled people in low and middle-income countries. Objective to assess utilization of family planning and associated factors among reproductive-age women with disability group in Arba Minch town, southern Ethiopia from 1st March to April 15, 2019. Methods community-based cross-sectional study with simple random sampling was used to select 4l8 reproductive age women with disabilities. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and interview by eight trained females who completed grade twelve two of which communicate by speaking and sign language. Data were entered using Epi info 7 and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. A statically significant variable in the final model was declared by AOR, 95%CI and p-value <0.05. Result in the current study family planning utilization among all reproductive-age women with disabilities was 33.7%. Family planning utilization was 2.2 times higher among those who have employed compared with those with not employed (AOR2.2 95% CI, 1.77- 4.15). Women who had a positive attitude were 2.3 times more likely to use family planning than negative attitudes (AOR 2.3:95% CI, 1.21- 3.87). Besides these women who got married were almost four times more likely to use family planning methods than unmarried (AOR 3.9:95% CI, 2.31-6.63). Conclusion The level of family planning utilization was low among reproductive women with disabilities and factors associated were attitude, marital status, & employed status, therefore governmental and non-governmental organization should promote for women with disabilities to change the attitude and creating job opportunities.","Mesfin, Y.; G/Meskel, F.; Estifanious, W.; Gizachew, Y.; Jemal, S.; Atnafu, N.; Nuriye, K.",20191206,"Sexual And Reproductive Health","10.1101/19013821",1,"Yibeltal Mesfin","Wolkite University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19013821v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19013821v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"http://www.wku.edu.et/midwifery"
890,"Local authority variation in uptake of the HPV vaccine in Greater Manchester and school-level factors: a cross-sectional ecological study","Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the main cause of cervical cancer and contributes to a number of other cancers that affect both men and women. Vaccines exist that offer protection against the most common cancer-causing HPV types. In England, a school-based vaccination programme for girls has been in place since 2008 but vaccine coverage rates have declined since its introduction. Understanding variation between schools and between local authorities may help to inform quality improvement and guide policy development and commissioning. Methods: Cross-sectional, ecological analysis of vaccine uptake among 164 schools representing 13,127 children in eight out of ten local authorities in Greater Manchester. Logistic mixed effects regression models were used to test for associations between school level factors and vaccine uptake, while allowing for variation between local authorities. Results: In multivariable mixed effects models, lower vaccination rates were associated with: increasing numbers of children eligible for vaccination; increasing proportions of children eligible for free school meals; increasing proportions of children with English as an additional language; Ofsted inadequate ratings; Christian and Muslim faith schools; independent schools and special schools. Conclusions: Consistent with previous studies on vaccine uptake, this study identifies a number of factors that are associated with uptake of the school-based HPV vaccine programme. We also show that local authority variation remains after adjustment for the mix of schools in each area. This evidence may be used to guide vaccine providers, commissioners, and policymakers who want to increase uptake of the school-based HPV vaccine.","Senior, S.

891,"Self-selected step length asymmetry is not explained by energy cost minimization in individuals with chronic stroke.","Background: Asymmetric gait post-stroke is associated with decreased mobility, yet individuals with chronic stroke often self-select an asymmetric gait despite being capable of walking more symmetrically. The purpose of this study was to test whether self-selected asymmetry could be explained by energy cost minimization. We hypothesized that short-term deviations from self-selected asymmetry would result in increased metabolic energy consumption, despite being associated with long-term rehabilitation benefits. Other studies have found no difference in metabolic rate across different levels of enforced asymmetry among individuals with chronic stroke, but used methods that left some uncertainty to be resolved. Methods: In this study, ten individuals with chronic stroke walked on a treadmill at participant-specific speeds while voluntarily modulating step length asymmetry. We included only participants with significant self-selected asymmetry who were able to significantly alter asymmetry using visual biofeedback. Conditions included targeting zero asymmetry, self-selected asymmetry, and double the self-selected asymmetry. Participants were trained with the biofeedback system in one session, and data were collected in three subsequent sessions with repeated measures. Self-selected asymmetry was consistent across sessions. A similar protocol was conducted among unimpaired participants. Results: Participants with chronic stroke substantially altered step length asymmetry using biofeedback, but this did not affect metabolic rate (ANOVA, p = 0.8). In unimpaired participants, self-selected step length asymmetry was close to zero and corresponded to the lowest energy cost (ANOVA, p = 6e-4). While the symmetry of unimpaired gait may be the result of energy cost minimization, self-selected step length asymmetry in individuals with chronic stroke cannot be explained by a similar least-effort drive. Conclusions: Interventions that encourage changes in step length asymmetry by manipulating metabolic energy consumption may be effective because these therapies would not have to overcome a metabolic penalty for altering asymmetry.","Nguyen, T.

903,"Prevalence and impact of oprD mutations in Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in cystic fibrosis","Defective OprD porins contribute to carbapenem resistance and may be important in Pseudomonas aeruginosa adaptation to cystic fibrosis airways. It is unclear whether oprD mutations are fixed in populations of shared strains that are transmitted between patients or whether novel variants arise during infection. We investigated oprD sequences and antimicrobial resistance of two common Australian shared strains, constructed P. aeruginosa mutants with the most common oprD allelic variants and compared characteristics between patients with or without evidence of infection with strains harbouring these variants. Our data show that three independently acquired nonsense mutations arising from a 1-base pair substitution are fixed in strain sub-lineages. These nonsense mutations are likely to contribute to reduced carbapenem susceptibility in the sub-lineages without compromising in vitro fitness. Not only was lung function worse among patients infected with strains harbouring the nonsense mutations than those without, but they also had an increased hazard rate of lung transplantation/death. Our findings further highlight that understanding adaptive changes may help to distinguish patients with greater adverse outcomes despite infection with the same strain.","Sherrard, L. J.; Wee, B.

902,"Enough evidence and other endings: a descriptive study of stable Cochrane systematic reviews in 2019.","Background: From 2006 to 2019, Cochrane reviews could be designated ""stable"" if they were not being updated but highly likely to be current. This provides an opportunity to observe practice in ending systematic reviewing and what is regarded as enough evidence. Methods: We identified Cochrane reviews designated stable in 2013 and 2019 and reasons for this designation. For those with conclusions stated to be so firm that new evidence is unlikely to change them, we assessed conclusions, strength of evidence ratings, and recommendations for further research. We assessed the fate of the 2013 stable reviews. We also estimated usage of formal analytic methods to determine when there is enough evidence in protocols for Cochrane reviews. Results: Cochrane reviews were rarely designated stable. In 2019, there were 507 stable Cochrane reviews (6.6% of 7,645 non-withdrawn reviews). The most common reasons related to no, little, or infrequent research activity expected (331 of 505; 65.5%). Only 39 reviews were stable because of firm conclusions unlikely to be changed by new evidence (7.7%), but that declaration was mostly not supported by judgments made in the review about strength of evidence and implications for research. Among the 180 reviews stable in 2013, 16 reverted to normal status (8.9%), with 2 of those changing conclusions because of new studies. Few Cochrane protocols specified an analytic method for determining when there was enough evidence to stop updating the review (116 of 2,415; 4.8%). Conclusion: Cochrane reviews were more likely to end because important future primary research activity was believed to be unlikely, than because there was enough evidence. Judgments about the strength of evidence and need for research were often inconsistent with the declaration that conclusions were unlikely to change. The inconsistencies underscore the need for reliable analytic methods to support decision-making about the conclusiveness of evidence.","Bastian, H.; Hemkens, L.

900,"Exploring barriers and facilitators to integrated hypertension-HIV management in Ugandan HIV clinics using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR)","Background: Persons Living with HIV (PLHIV) receiving antiretroviral therapy have increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Integration of services for hypertension (HTN), the primary CVD risk factor, into HIV clinics is recommended in Uganda. Our prior work demonstrated multiple gaps in implementation of integrated HTN care along the HIV treatment cascade. In this study, we sought to explore barriers to, and facilitators of, integrating HTN screening and treatment into HIV clinics in Eastern Uganda. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study at three HIV clinics with low, intermediate, and high HTN care cascade performance, which we classified based on our prior work. Guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), we conducted semi-structured interviews with health services managers, health care providers and hypertensive PLHIV (n=83). Interviews were transcribed verbatim. Three qualitative researchers used both deductive (CFIR model-driven) and inductive (open coding) methods to develop relevant codes and themes. Ratings were performed to determine valence and strengths of each CFIR construct regarding influencing HTN/HIV integration. Results: Of the 39 CFIR constructs assessed, 17 were relevant to either barriers or facilitators to HTN/HIV integration. Six constructs strongly distinguished performance and were barriers, three of which were in the Inner setting (Organizational Incentives & Rewards, Available Resources, Access to Knowledge & Information); two in Characteristics of individuals (Knowledge & Beliefs about the Intervention and Self-efficacy) and one in Intervention characteristics (Design Quality & Packaging). Four additional constructs were weakly distinguishing and negatively influenced HTN/HIV integration. There were four facilitators for HTN/HIV integration related to the intervention (Relative advantage, Adaptability, Complexity and Compatibility). The remaining four constructs negatively influenced HTN/HIV integration but were non-distinguishing. Conclusion: Using the CFIR, we have shown that while there are modifiable barriers to HTN/HIV integration in the Inner setting, Outer setting, Characteristics of individuals and implementation Process, HTN/HIV integration is of interest to patients, health care providers and managers. Improving access to HTN care among PLHIV will require overcoming barriers and capitalizing on the facilitators using a health system strengthening approach. These findings are a springboard for designing contextually appropriate interventions for HTN/HIV integration in low- and middle-income countries.","Muddu, M.; Tusubira, A.

904,"Personalized Connectome Mapping to Guide Targeted Therapy and Promote Recovery of Consciousness in the Intensive Care Unit","There are currently no therapies proven to promote early recovery of consciousness in patients with severe brain injuries in the intensive care unit (ICU). Early recovery of consciousness would benefit patients and families by reducing the likelihood of premature withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy and may decrease ICU complications related to immobility, facilitate self-expression, enable autonomous decision-making, and increase access to rehabilitative care. Here, we present the connectome-based clinical trial platform (CCTP), a new mechanistic paradigm for developing and testing targeted therapies that promote early recovery of consciousness in the ICU. The scientific premise of the CCTP is that personalized brain connectome maps can be used to select patients for targeted therapies that promote recovery of consciousness. Structural and functional MRI connectome maps will identify circuits that may be amenable to neuromodulation. Patients will be selected for clinical trials in the CCTP paradigm based on connectomes that are likely to respond to targeted therapies. To demonstrate the utility of this precision approach, we describe STIMPACT (Stimulant Therapy Targeted to Individualized Connectivity Maps to Promote ReACTivation of Consciousness), a CCTP-based clinical trial in which intravenous methylphenidate will be used to promote early recovery of consciousness in the ICU (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03814356). We propose that the CCTP has the potential to transform the therapeutic landscape in the ICU and improve outcomes for patients with severe brain injuries.","Edlow, B. L.; Barra, M. E.; Zhou, D.

901,"Using Paired Agent-Based Simulations To Test Strategies For Limiting The Effects Of Epidemics","Agent-based simulations are widely used nowadays in public health research for comparing different strategies for mitigating epidemics and for planning appropriate responses in the aftermath of crises in large urban areas because they can capture fine scale heterogeneities that may have important non-linear effects on the results. Given the costs of implementing strategies, decision-makers have to be convinced that the proposed treatment/procedure leads to a statistically significant improvement. This paper presents an innovative method for constructing paired agent-based simulations where exactly the same set of random effects is applied to simulations with and without the treatment/procedure. Statistical Analysis of Variance distinguishes the sum of squares between groups (BSS) from the sum of squares within groups (WSS). Our aim was to filter out the within sum of squares (WSS) leaving only the sum of squares between the control group and the treatment group (BSS). We propose to filter out the WSS by constructing paired simulations because as is well known, when paired t-tests can be used, they are much more powerful than ordinary t-tests. Pearson's Chi-squared goodness of fit, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and the Kullback-Leibler Divergence are then used to test whether the effect is statistically significant. This procedure has been tested on a case-study on the propagation of the Zika epidemic in Rio de Janeiro in 2015.","Armstrong, M.; Coelho, F.

915,"Knowledge about benefits and risks of undergoing cataract surgery among cataract patients in Southern China","Objective: To develop a theoretical framework for assessing knowledge about the possible outcomes of undergoing cataract surgery, and explore the association of knowledge level with psychological status and decision quality among patients with cataract in Southern China. Methods: The details of the knowledge scale were based on the health education information booklet provided by National Eye Institute, NIH. We used a theory-based approach to assess gist knowledge, which comprises conceptual and numeric questions related to knowledge of the possible surgical outcomes. The scale was then used in a cross-sectional study to assess the association of knowledge score with psychological status and decision quality of cataract patients, including worry, anxiety, attitudes, intentions, decisional conflict, confidence in decision making, anticipated regret and temporal orientation. Results: A total of 489 participants with age-related cataract were included in this study, and 10.2% (50/489) of them had adequate level of knowledge. The knowledge scale was significantly associated to the levels of worry (Odds Ratio (OR) = 0.36, 95%CI: 0.18, 0.70; P = 0.003), anxiety (beta coefficient = -5.36, 95%CI: -8.88,-1.84; P = 0.003), inaction regret (OR = 0.49, 95%CI : 0.28, 0.88; P = 0.016) and decision conflict (beta coefficient = -7.93, 95%CI: -12.81, -3.04; P = 0.002) in multivariate analyses adjusted for age, sex, education level and literacy level. Conclusion: The level of knowledge adequacy with cataract surgery outcomes is high in China and was associated with psychological status and decision quality. These findings suggest that strategies targeting knowledge of possible surgical outcomes may reduce psychological stress and improve decision quality among patients with age-related cataract.","Ye, G.; Qu, B.; Shi, W.; Chen, X.; Ma, P.; Zhong, Y.; Chen, S.; Lamoureux, E.; Zheng, Y.",20191211,"Ophthalmology","10.1101/19014100",1,"Yingfeng Zheng","State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19014100v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19014100v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"All data included in this manuscript is available."
910,"Out of hospital cardiac arrests in the Gulf Region: a scoping review","Background Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major cause of mortality worldwide. Recent studies demonstrated low survival rates in Middle Eastern countries. Anecdotally there are unique demographic, cultural and logistical challenges in this region. However, there remains a paucity of data published on OHCA in the Middle East. In order to address OHCA in a meaningful manner in the region, we first need to quantify the issue. Methods We conducted a scoping review of published and grey literature on OHCA in the Gulf Cooperative Council region that utilised Arksey and O'Malley's framework. Electronic databases and grey literature sources were identified and searched. Subject matter experts in the region were consulted. All types of studies in English and Arabic were included. Results A total of 24 studies were included from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, Kuwait, and Qatar. No literature was identified from the state of Bahrain. OHCA victims in the region are younger, predominantly male, and more co-morbid than those in Western studies. We observed low Emergency Medical Service utilisation, low bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation, return of spontaneous circulation, and survival to discharge rates across the region. There are differences in characteristics of OHCA among ethnic groups. Discussion and conclusions We identified unique characteristics associated with OHCA in the region, variances in processes and outcomes when compared to Western studies, and a lack of coordinated effort to research and address OHCA. We recommend creating lead agencies responsible for coordinating and developing strategies such as community response, public education, and reporting databases.","Batt, A.

912,"The epidemiology of systematic review updates: a longitudinal study of updating of Cochrane reviews, 2003 to 2018.","Background: The Cochrane Collaboration has been publishing systematic reviews in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) since 1995, with the intention that these be updated periodically. Objectives: To chart the long-term updating history of a cohort of Cochrane reviews and the impact on the number of included studies. Methods: The status of a cohort of Cochrane reviews updated in 2003 was assessed at three time points: 2003, 2011, and 2018. We assessed their subject scope, compiled their publication history using PubMed and CDSR, and compared them to all Cochrane reviews available in 2002 and 2017/18. Results: Of the 1,532 Cochrane reviews available in 2002, 11.3% were updated in 2003, with 16.6% not updated between 2003 and 2011. The reviews updated in 2003 were not markedly different to other reviews available in 2002, but more were retracted or declared stable by 2011 (13.3% versus 6.3%). The 2003 update led to a major change of the conclusions of 2.8% of updated reviews (n = 177). The cohort had a median time since publication of the first full version of the review of 18 years and a median of three updates by 2018 (range 1-11). The median time to update was three years (range 0-14 years). By the end of 2018, the median time since the last update was seven years (range 0-15). The median number of included studies rose from eight in the version of the review before the 2003 update, to 10 in that update and 14 in 2018 (range 0-347). Conclusions: Most Cochrane reviews get updated, however they are becoming more out-of-date over time. Updates have resulted in an overall rise in the number of included studies, although they only rarely lead to major changes in conclusion.","Bastian, H.; Doust, J.; Clarke, M.; Glasziou, P.",20191211,"Epidemiology","10.1101/19014134",1,"Hilda Bastian","Bond University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19014134v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19014134v1.full.pdf","cc_by",NA,"Data and supporting files, including analytic code, are available at GitHub"
914,"Knowledge and attitudes regarding infant BLS among babysitters and nursemaids in north rural Jordan","Background: There is a lack of national data related to the public knowledge and attitudes concerning Basic Life Support (BLS) for an infant. This study is the first to assess the knowledge and attitude regarding infant BLS among babysitters and nursemaids who are working in registered nurseries in North Jordan. Methods: A semi-structured questionnaire was conducted among a convenience sample of 77 child caretakers (babysitters and nursemaids) who were looking after infants in registered nurseries in the north of Jordan. Results: The findings show that the majority of participants were not aware of skills for managing foreign body aspiration (or CPR) among infants, while more than two-thirds of them never attended training and or education sessions regarding managing foreign body aspiration among infants. Conclusions: This research strongly recommends training for babysitters and care centre staff. The findings of this study indicated that caregivers in Jordanian kindergartens and nurseries lack awareness regarding safe infant care. As such, there is a lack of basic skills for resuscitation in urgent cases; which can increase the risk of sudden and unexpected child death. Accordingly, the infant life support course is highly recommended for babysitters and nursemaids. Health care professionals could help to implement infant basic life support training courses through local community basic service centres, non-governmental organizations, local associations, universities and health colleges through providing workshops that aim at enhancing knowledge and skills for infant BLS among caregivers and babysitters.","Hamadneh, S.",20191211,"Public And Global Health","10.1101/19014175",1,"Shereen Hamadneh","Al al-Bayt University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19014175v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19014175v1.full.pdf","cc0_ng",NA,"data available if the reviewer requested"

However, a lack of interoperability among healthcare systems still imposes a high cost to patients, hospitals, and insurers. Currently, most systems pass messages using idiosyncratic messaging standards that require specialized knowledge to interpret. This increases the cost of systems integration and often puts more advanced uses of data out of reach. In this project, we demonstrate how two open standards, FHIR and RDF, can be combined both to integrate data from disparate sources in real-time and make that data queryable and susceptible to automated inference. To validate the effectiveness of the semantic engine, we perform simulations of real-time data feeds and demonstrate how they can be combined and used by client-side applications with no knowledge of the underlying sources.","Cotter, D.

920,"The influence of common polygenic risk and gene sets on social skills group training response in autism spectrum disorder","Social skills group training (SSGT) is one of the most frequently used behavior interventions in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Current evidence suggests that the effects are moderate and heterogeneous. Genetic predisposition could be one of the factors contributing to this heterogeneity. Therefore, we used polygenic risk score (PRS) and gene-set analysis to investigate the association between SSGT response and common variants in autistic individuals. Participants from the largest randomized clinical trial of SSGT in ASD to date were selected for genotyping. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for ASD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and educational attainment (EA) were calculated, and their associations with the intervention outcome at post-intervention and follow-up were tested using mixed linear model. In addition, thirty-two gene sets within five categories (synaptic, glial, FMRP, glutamate, and mitochondrial) were selected to evaluate their role in the intervention outcome. Individuals with higher PRSs for ASD and ADHD had inferior response after SSGT. After multiple test correction, significant results were kept for higher ADHD PRS at follow-up ({beta} = 6.67, p = 0.016). Five gene sets within synaptic category showed modest association with reduced response to SSGT in ASD. Taken together, we provided preliminary evidence that genetic liability calculated using PRS and common variants in synapse gene sets could influence the outcome of SSGT. Our results hold promise for future research into the genetic contribution to individual response to ASD interventions, and should be validated in larger cohorts.","Li, D.; Choque-Olsson, N.; Jiao, H.; Norgren, N.; Jonsson, U.; Bolte, S.; Tammimies, K.",20191212,"Genetic And Genomic Medicine","10.1101/2019.12.04.19013888",1,"Kristiina Tammimies","Karolinska Institutet","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.04.19013888v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.04.19013888v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"Due to the legal restriction in the Swedish law we are not allow to share the raw genetic data used in the study"
974,"Mapping Psilocybin-Assisted Therapies: A Scoping Review","We conducted a scoping review on psilocybin-assisted therapy for addiction, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. Psilocybin is a naturally-occurring tryptophan derivative found in species of mushroom with psycho-active properties. From 2022 records identified by database searching, 40 publications were included in the qualitative synthesis from which we identified 9 clinical trials with a total of 169 participants. Trials used a peak-psychedelic model of therapy, emphasizing inward journey through the use of eyeshades, set musical scores and with medium to high doses of psilocybin. No serious adverse effects were reported; mild adverse effects included transient anxiety, nausea and post-treatment headaches. Overall, the 9 trials all demonstrated safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy in the treatments of obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance use disorder, treatment-resistant unipolar depression, anxiety or depression in patients with life-threatening cancer and demoralization among long-term AIDS survivors.The literature was found to be early and exploratory, with several limitations: only 5 were randomized controlled trials, small and homogenous patient sample size, difficulties in blinding, and the confounding influence of psychological supports provided. Further research is indicated to establish effectiveness for these and other indications, with a more diverse range of patients, and with differing program and dosing modalities.

923,"Informing Pharmacokinetic Models with Physiological Data: Oral Population Modeling of L-Serine in Humans","To determine how to set optimal oral L-serine (serine) dose levels for a clinical trial, existing literature was surveyed. Data sufficient to set the dose was inadequate, and so a (n=10) Phase I-A calibration trial was performed, administering serine with and without other oral agents. We analyzed the trial and the literature data using pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling and statistical analysis. The therapeutic goal is to modulate specific serine-related metabolic pathways in the liver using the lowest possible dose which gives the desired effect since the upper bound was expected to be limited by toxicity. In this paper, we first review relevant literature, describe the calibration trial and resulting data, and present the results of modeling from the trial. Serine is a non-essential amino acid that is nonetheless present at a base level in blood from both dietary sources and endogenous production. Serine is consumed by several pathways. A standard PK approach, in which a common model structure was selected using a fit to data, yielded a model with a single central compartment corresponding to plasma, clearance from that compartment, and an endogenous source of serine. The lack of intravenous data normally prevents independent determination of bioavailability and volume of distribution, however, under some assumptions about endogenous synthesis and use, values could be estimated. The model was poorly conditioned but did give consistent estimates. To improve conditioning, a parametric structure was changed to estimate ratios (bioavailability over volume, for example). Model fit quality was improved and the uncertainty in estimated parameters was reduced. Because of the particular interest in the fate of serine, the model was used to estimate whether serine is consumed in the gut, absorbed by the liver, or entered the blood in either a free state, or in a protein- or tissue-bound state that is not measured by our assay. The PK model structure was set up to represent relevant physiology, and this quantitative systems biology approach allowed a broader set of physiological data to be used to narrow parameter and prediction confidence intervals, and to better understand the biological meaning of the data. The model results allowed us to determine the optimal human dose for future trials, including a trial design component including IV and tracer studies. A key contribution is that we were able to use human physiological data from the literature to inform the PK model and to set reasonable bounds on parameters, and to improve model conditioning. Leveraging literature data produced a more predictive, useful model.","Bosley, J.; Bjornson, E.; Zhang, C.; Turkez, H.; Nielsen, J.; Uhlen, M.; Boran, J.; Mardinoglu, A.",20191214,"Pharmacology And Therapeutics","10.1101/2019.12.07.19011429",1,"Adil Mardinoglu","KTH - Royal Institute of Technology","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.07.19011429v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.07.19011429v1.full.pdf","cc_by",NA,"All data are available in the manuscript"

This study aims to assess the degree of co-localisation between automated lesion detection and the seizure onset zone (SOZ) as assessed by sEEG. Methods: A neural network classifier was applied to cortical features from MRI data from three cohorts. 1) The network was trained and cross-validated using 34 patients with visible focal cortical dysplasias (FCDs). 2) Specificity was assessed in 20 paediatric healthy controls. 3) Feasibility for incorporation into sEEG implantation plans was evaluated in 38 sEEG patients. Coordinates of sEEG contacts were coregistered with classifier-predicted lesions. sEEG contacts in seizure onset and irritative tissue were identified by clinical neurophysiologists. A distance of <10mm between SOZ contacts and classifier-predicted lesions was considered co-localisation. Results: In patients with radiologically-defined lesions, classifier sensitivity was 74% (25/34 lesions detected). No clusters were detected in the controls (specificity 100%). Of 34 sEEG patients, 21 patients had a focal cortical SOZ. Of these there was co-localisation between classifier output and SOZ contacts in 62%. The algorithm detected 7/8 histopathologically-confirmed FCDs (86%). Conclusions: There was a high degree of co-localisation between automated lesion detection and sEEG. We have created a framework for incorporation of deep-learning based MRI lesion detection into sEEG implantation planning. Our findings demonstrate that automated MRI analysis could be used to plan optimal electrode trajectories.","Wagstyl, K.; Adler, S.; Pimpel, B.; Chari, A.; Seunarine, K.; Lorio, S.; Thornton, R.; Baldeweg, T.; Tisdall, M.",20191214,"Neurology","10.1101/2019.12.08.19013979",1,"Konrad Wagstyl","University College London","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.08.19013979v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.08.19013979v1.full.pdf","cc_by",NA,"Code and results tables are all available at https://github.com/MELDProject/sEEG"
926,"Malignant pleural effusions as an alternative to biopsies for the detection of EGFR TKI sensitizing mutations","Lung cancer is the cause of a fourth of all cancer-related deaths. About a third of all lung adenocarcinoma tumours harbour mutations on exons 18, 19, 20 and 21 of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene. Detection of these mutations allows for targeted therapies in the form of EGFR Tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In our study, we utilized malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) as liquid biopsies to detect EGFR mutations when tissue biopsies were unavailable. We showed that a direct sequencing approach was likely to miss SNVs in MPEs. We then optimized an EGFR mutant-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based assay and piloted it on n=10 pleural effusion samples (1 non-malignant pleural effusion as a negative control). 5/9 (55.55%) samples harboured EGFR mutations with 2/9 (22.22%) being exon 19 deletions and 3/9 (33.33%) had the S768I exon 20 mutation. The frequency of the S768I SNV in our study was significantly higher than that observed in other studies (~0.3%). Utilizing publicly available cBioPortal data, we report that patients with the S768I SNV had a shorter median survival time, progression-free survival time and lower tumor mutation count compared to patients with other EGFR mutations. These data suggest that this point mutation predicts poor prognosis as a result of aggressive disease, though studies in larger cohorts are necessary to confirm these findings. The high frequency of S768I mutations seen in our study also suggests that cancer cells harbouring these mutations may be superior in their ability to migrate, home or reside in pleural fluid.","D'souza, G.; Dhar, C.; Kyalanoor, V.; Yadav, L.; Sharma, M.; Nawaz S, M.; Srivastava, S.",20191214,"Genetic And Genomic Medicine","10.1101/2019.12.08.19014167",1,"Sweta Srivastava","St. John\'s National Academy of Health Sciences, Bangalore, India","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.08.19014167v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.08.19014167v1.full.pdf","cc_by",NA,"There is no metadata associated with this study.

919,"Genetic analysis of functional rare germline variants across 9 cancer types from the DiscovEHR study","Rare variants play an essential role in the etiology of cancer and characterizing rare germline variants that impact the risk of cancer is an ongoing challenge. We performed a genome-wide rare variant analysis using germline whole exome sequencing (WES) data derived from the Geisinger MyCode initiative to discover cancer predisposition variants. The analysis was conducted using 5,538 cancer patients and 7,286 matched controls in a discovery set and 1,991 cancer patients and 2,504 matched controls in a validation set across nine cancer types. The variants in the WES data were annotated and filtered for pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants using ClinVar and Variant Effect Predictor (VEP). After filtering, case-control association tests were conducted on each cancer type separately by binning the pathogenic and likely pathogenic rare variants into genes and pathways using SKAT-O. We discovered 87 genes and 106 pathways significantly associated with cancer (Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05) out of which seven genes and 26 pathways replicated from the validation set (suggestive threshold P < 0.05). Further, four genes and 21 pathways were discovered to be associated with multiple cancers (Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05). Additionally, we identified 13 genes and two pathways associated with survival outcome across seven cancers (Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05), where two genes, PCDHB8 and DCHS2, were also associated with survival outcome in TCGA data. In summary, we conducted one of the largest pan-cancer association studies using germline data derived from a single hospital system to find novel predisposition genes and pathways associated with nine cancers. Our results can inform future guidelines for germline genetic testing in cancer, which will be helpful in screening for cancer high-risk patients. This work adds to the knowledge base and progress being made in precision medicine.","Shivakumar, M.; Miller, J.; Dasari, V.

We investigated ITH of somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), DNA methylation, and point mutations in lung cancer driver genes in 292 tumor samples from 84 LUAD patients. We found substantial SCNA and methylation ITH, and clonal architecture analyses showed congruent evolutionary trajectories for SCNAs and DNA methylation aberrations. Interestingly, methylation ITH mapping to gene promoter areas or tumor suppressor genes was low. Moreover, ITH composed of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms altering the same cancer driver genes was found in several tumors. To quantify ITH for valid statistical association analyses we developed an average pairwise ITH index (APITH), which does not depend on the number of samples per tumor. APITH indexes for SCNAs and methylation aberrations were both significantly associated with poor prognosis. This study further establishes the important clinical implications of genetic and epigenetic ITH in LUAD.","Hua, X.; Zhao, W.; Pesatori, A. C.; Consonni, D.; Caporaso, N.

945,"A polygenic risk score for rheumatoid arthritis sheds light on the Prevotella association","Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease associated with reduced life expectancy. It is heritable and an extensive repertoire of genetic variants have been identified. The gut microbiota may represent an environmental risk factor for RA. Indeed, Prevotella copri is a candidate keystone species, but whether it lies on the causal pathway for disease or is simply a bystander reflecting host-genetic predisposition to RA, remains to be determined. The study of disease-microbiota associations may be confounded by the presence of the disease of interest or by its treatment. To circumvent this issue, we assessed whether known RA risk alleles were associated with the gut microbiota, in a large who do not have RA. Methods: Blood and stool acquired from volunteers from TwinsUK were used for genotyping and assessment of the gut microbiota, respectively. A weighted polygenic risk score (PRS) for RA was calculated in 1650 unaffected twins from the TwinsUK cohort, based on 233 published GWAS-identified published RA associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were generated from 16S rRNA sequencing of stool samples and assessed for association with RA PRS. Confirmation of findings was performed using an independent sample comprised of first-degree relatives of RA patients from the SCREEN-RA cohort (n=133). Findings: We found that Prevotella spp was positively associated with RA PRS in TwinsUK participants (p.adj<1e-7). This finding was validated in SCREEN-RA participants carrying the shared epitope risk alleles (p.adj=1.12e-3). An association of Prevotella spp. with pre-clinical RA phases was also demonstrated(p.adj=0.021). Interpretation: Prevotella in the gut microbiota is associated with RA genotype in the absence of RA, as well as in subjects at high risk of developing RA. This work suggests that host genotype is associated with microbiota profile prior to disease onset.","Wells, P. M.; Adebayo, A. S.; Freidin, M. B.; Finckh, A.; Strowig, T.; Lesker, T.

930,"Metabolomics pilot study identifies circadian desynchronization and distinct intra-patient variability patterns in critical illness","Background: Synchronized circadian rhythms play a key role in coordinating physiologic health. Desynchronized circadian rhythms may predispose individuals to disease or be indicative of underlying disease. Intensive care unit (ICU) patients likely experience desynchronized circadian rhythms due to disruptive environmental conditions in the ICU and underlying pathophysiology. This observational pilot study was undertaken to determine if circadian rhythms are altered in ICU patients relative to healthy controls by profiling circadian rhythms in vital signs and plasma metabolites. Methods: We monitored circadian rhythms in 5 healthy controls and 5 ICU patients for 24 hours. Heart rate and blood pressure were measured every 30 minutes, temperature was measured every hour, and blood was sampled for mass spectrometry-based plasma metabolomics every 4 hours. Bedside sound levels were measured every minute. Circadian rhythms were evaluated in vitals and plasma metabolites individually and in each group using the cosinor method. Results: ICU patient rooms were significantly louder than healthy controls' rooms and average noise levels were above EPA recommendations. Healthy controls generally had significant circadian rhythms individually and as a group. While a few ICU patients had significant circadian rhythms in isolated variables, no significant rhythms were identified in ICU patients as a group, except in cortisol. This indicates a lack of coherence in circadian phases and amplitudes among ICU patients. Finally, principal component analysis of metabolic profiles showed surprising patterns in plasma sample clustering. Each ICU patient's samples were clearly discernable in individual clusters, separate from a single cluster of healthy controls. Conclusions: ICU patients' circadian rhythms show significant desynchronization compared to healthy controls. Clustering of plasma metabolic profiles suggests that metabolomics could be used to track individual patients' clinical courses longitudinally. Our results show global disordering of metabolism and the circadian system in ICU patients which should be characterized further in order to determine implications for patient care.","Lusczek, E.

Objective: We aimed to determine the risk of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in MS patients. Material and Methods: Retrospective cohort analyses were performed using an all-England national linked Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) dataset (1999-2016) and to determine whether schizophrenia or bipolar disorder are more commonly diagnosed subsequently in people with MS (n=128,194), and whether MS is more commonly diagnosed subsequently in people with schizophrenia (n=384,188) or bipolar disorder (n=203,592), than would be expected when compared with a reference cohort (~15 million people) after adjusting for age and other factors. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: Findings were dependent on whether the index and subsequent diagnoses were selected as the primary reason for hospital admission or were taken from anywhere on the hospital record. When searching for diagnoses anywhere on the hospital record, there was a significantly elevated risk of subsequent schizophrenia (aHR 1.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.40 to 1.60) and of bipolar disorder (aHR 1.14, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.24) in people with prior-recorded MS and of subsequent MS in people with prior-recorded schizophrenia (aHR 1.26, 1.15-1.37) or bipolar disorder (aHR 1.73, 1.57-1.91), but most of these associations were reduced to null when analyses were confined to diagnoses recorded as the primary reason for admission. Conclusion: Further research is needed to investigate the potential association between MS and schizophrenia and/or bipolar disorder as it may shed light on underlying pathophysiology and help identify potential shared risk factors.","Meier, U.-C.; Ramagopalan, S.

Current wearable methods analyzing time components (e.g., pulse transit time) still lack clinical accuracy, whereas existing technologies for direct BP measurement are too bulky. Here we present a new art of continuous non-invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring (CNAP2GO). It directly measures BP by using a new ""volume control technique"" and could be used for small wearable sensors integrated in a finger ring. As a software prototype, CNAP2GO showed excellent BP measurement performance in comparison with invasive BP in 46 patients having surgery. The resulting pulsatile BP signal carries information to derive cardiac output and other hemodynamic variables. We show that CNAP2GO can be miniaturized for wearable approaches. CNAP2GO potentially constitutes the breakthrough for wearable sensors for blood pressure and flow monitoring in both ambulatory and in-hospital clinical settings.","Fortin, J.; Rogge, D.; Fellner, C.; Flotzinger, D.; Grond, J.; Lerche, K.; Saugel, B.",20191214,"Cardiovascular Medicine","10.1101/2019.12.10.19013938",1,"Julian Grond","CNSystems Medizintechnik GmbH, Reininghausstrasse 13, 8020 Graz, Austria","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19013938v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19013938v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"Not applicable"
933,"Imagination exercises improve language in younger but not in older children with autism suggesting a strong critical period","Based on a few cases of childhood traumatic aphasia and hemispherectomy, Lenneberg suggested a critical period for first language acquisition. Lenneberg's ideas are still debated today and have never been tested in a large group of children. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) provides such an opportunity as language acquisition is a common problem in ASD. Here, we report data from a three-year-long observational trial of 8,766 children with ASD. We initiated this trial in order to test two hypotheses: 1) voluntary imagination is central to complex language and 2) there exists a strong critical period for voluntary imagination acquisition closing shortly after the age of 5. Accordingly, we developed imagination exercises (verbal and nonverbal), organized them into an application called Mental Imagery Therapy for Autism (MITA) and provided this MITA app gratis to children ages 2 to 12. MITA-experienced children (N=3,540) were matched to the 'treatment-as-usual' participants (TaU, N=5,226). Both younger (2-5 years of age) and older children (5-12 YOA) in MITA and TaU groups improved their language over time, but on an annualized basis, younger MITA children improved their language 3-fold faster than TaU group. There was no difference between MITA and TaU in the older children group. These findings support Lenneberg's critical period hypothesis and indicate that acquisition of voluntary imagination is essential for the full language acquisition. Crucially, our results imply that the underlying plasticity dramatically diminishes after the age of five and therefore even greater therapeutic intervention should be targeting the very first years of a child's life.

Protocol for a systematic review and network meta-analysis.","Introduction: Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is one of the most commonly performed sports medicine procedures. A variety of grafts are currently used for reconstruction, including both allograft and autograft. Despite numerous meta-analyses, there exists no high-quality quantitative synthesis of all randomized controlled trial (RCT) data on graft choice. Objective: To identify the optimal graft choice for ACL reconstruction by performing the first systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) to include both functional outcomes and complications. Methods: Multiple digital databases including MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL will be searched independently and in duplicate for RCTs randomizing graft choice in ACL reconstruction in skeletally mature patients. A Bayesian framework with a random-effects model will be used for NMA. Surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values will be used to generate a rank list for each outcome. Results will be reported as mean differences (MD) (or standardized mean difference, if necessary) or relative risk (RR) with 95% credible intervals (CI). Comparisons will be inferred to be statistically significant if the 95% CI of MD does not cross zero or if the 95% CI of relative risk does not cross one. Studies will be assessed for quality using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Quality of evidence for each network comparison will be determined as per the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach for network meta-analyses. This NMA will be reported according to the PRISMA extension statement for network meta-analyses Outcomes of interest: Functional outcomes of interest including range of motion, return to activity/sport, and IKDC, Lysholm, Tegner, ACL-QOL, and KOOS scores. Persistent laxity as measured by Lachman, Pivot-shift, side-to-side, and measured laxity (e.g. KT-1000) will also be analyzed. Complications (e.g. infection, graft failure, donor site pain), tunnel osteolysis, and failure (including but not limited to graft rupture and/or persistent laxity) will be compared between grafts. Relevance/Impact: This NMA will be the first high-quality syntheses of all randomized evidence regarding graft choice in ACL reconstruction. As the first analysis to compare all major graft choices independently, it will be used to inform surgeon-patient decision making. It has the reasonable possibility of changing clinical practice.","Habibi, J.; Zakharia, A.; Woolnough, T.; Axelrod, D.; De Sa, D.",20191214,"Orthopedics","10.1101/2019.12.10.19014266",1,"Taylor Woolnough","McMaster University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19014266v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19014266v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"Not applicable."
970,"Clustering of susceptible individuals within households can drive measles outbreaks: an individual-based model exploration","When estimating important measures such as the herd immunity threshold, and the corresponding efforts required to eliminate measles, it is often assumed that susceptible individuals are uniformly distributed throughout populations. However, unvaccinated individuals may be clustered in a variety of ways, including by geographic location, by age, in schools, or in households. Here, we investigate to which extent different levels of within-household clustering of susceptible individuals may impact the risk and persistence of measles outbreaks. To this end, we apply an individual-based model, Stride, to a population of 600,000 individuals, using data from Flanders, Belgium. We compare realistic scenarios regarding the distribution of susceptible individuals within households in terms of their impact on epidemiological measures for outbreak risk and persistence. We find that higher levels of within-household clustering of susceptible individuals increase the risk, size and persistence of measles outbreaks. Ignoring within-household clustering thus leads to underestimations of measles elimination and outbreak mitigation efforts.","Kuylen, E.; Willem, L.; Broeckhove, J.; Beutels, P.; Hens, N.",20191216,"Epidemiology","10.1101/2019.12.10.19014282",2,"Elise Kuylen","Universiteit Antwerpen","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19014282v2?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19014282v2.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"The datasets generated and analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request."
941,"Using the Bayesian credible subgroups method to identify populations benefiting from treatment: An application to the Look AHEAD trial","Traditionally, subgroup analyses are used to assess whether patient characteristics moderate treatment effectiveness with general disregard for issues of multiplicity. Using data from The Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) trial in the United States, we aim to identify a subgroup where all of its types of members experience a treatment benefit defined as reducing the likelihood of a major cardiovascular event under an intensive lifestyle and weight-loss intervention. We apply the credible subgroups method to a Bayesian logistic model with a conservative prior that is sceptical of large treatment effect heterogeneity. The covariate profiles for which there is sufficient evidence of treatment benefit are, coarsely, middle-aged women, in poor subjective general health and with moderately to poorly controlled diabetes. There is at least 80% posterior probability that the conditional average treatment effect is positive for all covariate profiles fitting this description, which account for 0.5% of trial participants. Conversely, the covariate profiles that are likely to be associated with no benefit are middle aged and older men in excellent subjective general health, with well-controlled diabetes. These profiles apply to less than 2% of trial participants. More information is required to determine treatment benefit or no benefit for the remainder of the trial population.","Coonan, A.; Forbes, J.; Schnell, P.; Smith, J.",20191214,"Health Economics","10.1101/2019.12.10.19014357",1,"Anna Coonan","The University of Limerick","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19014357v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.10.19014357v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd","10.1371/journal.pone.0231241","Legal requirements prohibit public sharing of the dataset.

931,"Considering the APOE locus in polygenic scores for Alzheimer's disease","Polygenic scores are a strategy to aggregate the small, additive effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms across the genome. With phenotypes like Alzheimer's disease, which have a strong and well established genomic locus (APOE), the cumulative effect of genetic variants outside of this area has not been well established in a population-representative sample. Here we examine the association between polygenic scores both with and without the APOE region at different P value thresholds. We also investigate the addition of APOE-{varepsilon}4 carrier status and its effect on the polygenic score - dementia association. We found that including the APOE region through weighted variants in a polygenic score was insufficient to capture the large amount of risk attributed to this region. We recommend removing this region from polygenic score calculation and treating the APOE locus as an independent covariate.","Ware, E. B.; Faul, J. D.; Mitchell, C.; Bakulski, K.

935,"Optically Pumped Magnetoencephalography in Epilepsy","Our aim was to demonstrate the first use of Optically Pumped Magnetoencephalography (OP-MEG) in an epilepsy patient with unrestricted head movement. Current clinical MEG uses a traditional SQUID system for recording MEG signal, where sensors are cryogenically cooled and housed in a helmet in which the patient's head is fixed. Here we use a different type of sensor (OPM), which operates at room temperature and can be placed directly on the patient's scalp, permitting free head movement. We performed two 30 minute OP-MEG recording sessions in a patient with refractory focal epilepsy and compared these with clinical scalp EEG performed earlier. OP-MEG was able to identify analogous interictal activity to scalp EEG, and source localise this activity to an appropriate brain region. This is the first application of OP-MEG in human epilepsy. Future directions include simultaneous EEG/OP-MEG recording and prolonged OP-MEG telemetry.","Vivekananda, U.; Mellor, S.; Tierney, T.

925,"Using Media to Promote Public Awareness of Early Detection of Kaposi's Sarcoma in Africa","Background: Despite its hallmark cutaneous presentation, most Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) in Africa is diagnosed too late for effective treatment. Early diagnosis will only be achievable if patients with KS present earlier for care. We hypothesized that public awareness about KS can be enhanced through exposure to common media. Methods: We developed educational messages regarding early detection of KS for the general African public portraying a three-part theme: ""Look"" (regularly examine one's skin/mouth); ""Show"" (bring to the attention of a healthcare provider any skin/mouth changes); and ""Test"" (ask for a biopsy for definitive diagnosis). We packaged the messages in three common media forms (comic strips, radio, and video) and tested their effect on increasing KS awareness among adults attending markets in Uganda. Participants were randomized to a single exposure to one of the media and evaluated for change in KS-related knowledge and attitudes. Results: Among 420 participants, media exposure resulted in increased ability to identify KS (from 0.95% pre-test to 46% post-test); awareness that anyone is at risk for KS (29% to 50%); belief that they may be at risk (63% to 76%); and knowledge that definitive diagnosis requires biopsy (23% to 51%) (all p<0.001). Most participants (96%) found the media culturally appropriate. Conclusion: Exposure to media featuring a theme of ""Look"", ""Show"", ""Test"" resulted in changes in knowledge and attitudes concerning KS among the general public in Uganda. High incidence and poor survival of KS in Africa are an impetus to further evaluate these media, which are freely available online.","Laker-Oketta, M.; Butler, L.

929,"Financial interests and evidence in public comments on the FDA framework for modifications to artificial intelligence/machine learning-based medical devices","The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has proposed a regulatory framework for modifications to artificial intelligence/machine learning-based software as a medical device (SaMD). We analysed the 125 non-duplicate and non-spam public comments on the proposed framework and found that industry and other parties with a potential financial interest contributed a minimum of 63% of comments and that the absence of a conflict of interest could be confirmed in only 8%. Despite the FDA's stated commitment to using scientific evidence in the rule-making process, the vast majority of submitted comments (86%) did not cite any scientific literature, just 4% cited a systematic review or meta-analysis, and no comments indicated whether a systematic process was used to identify relevant literature. We recommend that the FDA requires disclosure of conflicts of interest in comments in the future. As the framework continues to be modified, engagement from non-conflicted parties and better use of scientific evidence may help to ensure the development of a regulatory system that best promotes patient interests.","Smith, J.

Method: A community-based cross-sectional study was done in Kolla Diba town from May 30-June 16, 2019. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select 627 study participants. Data was collected through basic ophthalmic examination with a portable slit lamp, 3x magnifying loop and torchlight and a pretested structured questionnaire were administered to collect the data. Then the data entered into EPI INFO version 7 and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression analysis were employed. P-values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Result: A total of 605 study participants were involved with a response rate of 96.5%. Among them 317 (52.4%) participants were males. The mean age of the respondents was 38.18 +/- 15.56 with a range of (18-95) in years. The overall Prevalence of pterygium among adults living in Kolla Diba town was 112 (18.5% (95% CI (15.6- 21.7)). Being widowed (AOR = 7.32 (95%CI: 2.88, 18.57)), outdoor occupation (AOR = 2.50 (95%CI: 1.46, 4.29)), sun exposure (AOR = 2.38 (95%CI: 1.28, 4.43)), wind exposure (AOR = 1.97 (95%CI: 1.04, 3.72)), alcohol drinking (AOR = 2.26 (95%CI: 1.48, 4.63)), and severe blepharitis (AOR = 2.45 (95%CI: 1.48, 4.05)) had statistically significant positive association with pterygium. Conclusion: The prevalence of pterygium was relatively higher. Marital status (being widowed), outdoor occupation, sun exposure, wind exposure, alcohol drinking, and severe blepharitis were significantly associated with the development of pterygium.","Alemayehu, T.

944,"Towards early risk biomarkers: serum metabolic signature in childhood predicts cardio-metabolic risk in adulthood","Cardiovascular diseases have their origin in childhood. Early biomarkers identifying individuals with increased risk for disease are needed to support early detection and to optimize prevention strategies. By applying machine learning approach on high throughput NMR-based metabolomics data, we identified metabolic predictors of cardiovascular risk in circulation in a cohort of 396 females, followed from childhood (mean age 11.2 years) to early adulthood (mean age 18.1 years). The identified childhood metabolic signature included three circulating biomarkers robustly associating with increased cardiovascular risk in early adulthood (AUC = 0.641 to 0.802, all p<0.01). These associations were confirmed in two validation cohorts including middle-aged women, with similar effect estimates. We subsequently applied random intercept cross-lagged panel model analysis, which suggested causal relationship between metabolites and cardio-metabolic risk score from childhood to early adulthood. These results provide evidence for the utility of circulating metabolomics panel to identify children and adolescents at risk for cardiovascular disease, to whom preventive measures and follow-up could be indicated.","Ojanen, X.; Cheng, R.; Tormakangas, T.; Wu, N.; Rappaport, N.; Wilmanski, T.; Yan, W.; Price, N.

943,"Assessment and Utilization of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measures to Improve Cardiovascular Disease Prevention","Background: The American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 (LS7) consist of clinical factors and health-related behaviors associated with cardiovascular health. The prevalence of these health factors among patients seeking specialized cardiovascular care is unknown. We sought to quantify patient-reported cardiovascular risk among those seeking specialized cardiovascular care and implement tailored quality improvement interventions. Methods and Results: Patients cared for by cardiovascular specialists at an academic medical center were surveyed with a modified LS7. We compared the prevalence of optimal health factors by atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) status. Recent smokers or patients with ASCVD reporting non-adherence to antiplatelets or statins were contacted. Surveys for 5,950 patients were collected during 2014 to 2016. The mean (SD) age was 64 (15) years, 2613 (44%) were women, and 3478 (58%) had ASCVD. Only 34 (0.6 %) achieved ideal status for all 7 factors, which did not differ by ASCVD status (P=0.48). Of 404 (6.8%) reporting recent smoking, 94/404 (23.3%) were successfully contacted, and 71/404 (17.6%) accepted support. Among those with ASCVD, 84 (2.4%) reported not taking a statin/antiplatelet without contraindications. Conclusions: The prevalence of optimal health factors, including health-related behaviors, among patients cared for by cardiovascular specialists remains low. Assessment of patient-reported outcomes facilitates scalable interventions to improve cardiovascular disease prevention.","Finneran, P. A.; Sanborn, T.; Guo, X.; Traynor, K. C.; Jaff, M.

937,"Genetic Polymorphisms, Adherence to Mediterranean Diet and Microbiota-Associated Urolithin Metabotypes: A Complex Cocktail to Predict the Obesity in Childhood-Adolescence","Environmental and genetic factors are associated with pandemic obesity since childhood. However, the association of overweight-obesity with these factors, acting as a consortium, has been scarcely studied in children. We aimed here to assess the probabilities of being overweighed-obese in a randomly recruited cohort of Spanish children and adolescents (n=415, 5{+/-}17 years-old) by estimating the odds ratios for different predictor variables, and their relative importance in the prediction. The predictor variables were ethnicity, age, sex, adherence to the Mediterranean diet (KIDMED), physical activity, urolithin metabotypes (UM-A, UM-B, and UM-0) as biomarkers of the gut microbiota, and 53 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 43 genes mainly related to obesity and cardiometabolic diseases. A proportional-odds logistic ordinal regression, validated through bootstrap, was used to model the data. While every variable was not independently associated with overweight-obesity, however, the ordinal logistic model revealed that overweight-obesity prevalence was related to being a young boy with either UM-B or UM-0, low KIDMED score and high contribution of a consortium of 24 SNPs, being rs1801253-ADRB1, rs4343-ACE, rs8061518-FTO, rs1130864-CRP, rs659366-UCP2, rs6131-SELP, rs12535708-LEP, rs1501299-ADIPOQ, rs708272-CETP and rs2241766-ADIPOQ the top-ten contributing SNPs.

948,"Determining factors for pertussis vaccination policy: A study in 5 EU countries","Pertussis vaccination policy varies across Europe, not only in the type of vaccine (whole cell (wP) vs. acellular (aP1/2/3/5)) but also in the schedule and recommendation for parents. This study aims to investigate the determining factors for the type of vaccine, immunization schedule and maternal immunization recommendation. From March to May 2019, experts in national health agencies and major academic or research institutions from Denmark, France, Poland, Sweden and the UK were invited to a semi-structured interview. Thematic analysis was performed on the transcripts using a codebook formulated by 3 coders. Inter-coder agreement was assessed. Fifteen expert interviews were conducted. The identified driving factors for pertussis vaccine policy were classified into three domains: scientific factors, sociological factors, and pragmatic factors. The determining factors for the type of vaccine were prescriber preference, concern of adverse events following immunization (AEFI), effectiveness, and consideration of other vaccine components in combined vaccines. The determining factors for infant schedule were immunity response and the potential to improve coverage and timeliness. The determining factors for maternal immunization were infant mortality and public acceptability. To conclude, socio-political and pragmatic factors were, besides scientific factors, important in determining the vaccine type, schedule of childhood immunization and recommendations for parents.","Wong, A.; Opinel, A.; Combes, S.

950,"Genetically predicted serum urate, blood pressure and cardiovascular disease: an updated Mendelian randomization investigation","Aims: To investigate the effect of serum urate on blood pressure and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk by updating evidence from Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods and Results: Using recently available data from the Million Veterans Program and UK Biobank, the main MR analyses showed that every 1-standard deviation increase in genetically predicted serum urate was associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease (odds ratio 1.19, 95% confidence interval 1.10-1.30, P=4x10-5), peripheral artery disease (1.12, 95%CI 1.03 to 1.21, P=9x10-3), and stroke (1.11, 95%CI 1.05 to 1.18, P=2x10-4). In MR mediation analyses, SBP was estimated to mediate approximately one third the effect of urate on CVD risk. Systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs showed a favorable effect of urate-lowering treatment on SBP (mean difference -2.55mmHg, 95%CI -4.06 to -1.05, P=1x10-3) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in those with previous CVD (OR 0.40, 95%CI 0.22 to 0.73, P=3x10-3), but no significant effect on MACE in all individuals (OR 0.73, 95%CI 0.48 to 1.09, P=0.12). Conclusion: MR and clinical trial data support an effect of higher serum urate on increasing blood pressure, which may mediate a consequent effect on CVD risk. High-quality trials are necessary to provide definitive evidence on the specific clinical contexts where urate-lowering may be of cardiovascular benefit.","Gill, D.; Burgess, S.; Li, X.; Karhunen, V.; Cameron, A.; Zuber, V.; Tsao, P.

954,"Mendelian randomization of smoking behavior on cognitive status among older Americans","Background: Smoking is a likely risk factor for dementia, and smoking behavior has a strong genetic component. In this study, we jointly test the associations between cumulative genetic risk for smoking, smoking behavior, and cognitive status using a Mendelian randomization framework. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using the 2010 wave of the Health and Retirement Study database. Individuals aged between 50 and 90 were included. Smoking status was self-reported. Polygenic scores (PGSs) were calculated by weighting participant genotype by published smoking genome-wide association estimates. Cognitive status (normal, impaired, dementia) was measured using multiple assessments. A Mendelian randomization framework was used to infer causal relationships between smoking behavior and cognitive status via genetic instruments. Results: Among European ancestry participants (N = 8,735), current smoking behavior was positively associated with cognitive impairment (OR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.29, 2.01) relative to normal cognition. Using smoking PGS as an instrumental variable, a causal relationship was observed between current smoking and cognitive impairment (OR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.07, 2.18). There were no associations between smoking PGS, smoking behaviors and cognitive status in the African ancestry study sample (N = 2,511). Conclusions: Current smoking is a modifiable risk factor which causes cognitive impairment. Promotion of smoking cessation is important for public health.

953,"Mendelian randomization analysis of smoking behavior and cognitive ability on the Big Five","Tobacco smoke, a mutagen that can thin the brain's cortex, might influence the Big Five (neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion, and openness). Cognitive ability, however, is a potential confounder, since it is associated with who smokes and with personality. Mendelian randomization (MR), which uses genetic variants as instrumental variables, can be used to probe the causal nature of these factors on personality. Here, MR was used to appraise smoking and cognitive ability on the Big Five and cognitive ability and neuroticism on social disparity. The results seem to suggest that smoking, independent of cognitive ability, leads people to be more neurotic and less extraverted and conscientious. Higher cognitive ability appears to make people less neurotic and more open, when accounting for smoking. Neuroticism appears to increase disparity, and higher cognitive ability appears to decrease it. Smoking may enhance disparity between those of lower and higher cognitive ability by exacerbating personality differences.","Adams, C.

956,"Brain-Computer Interface Robotics for Hand Rehabilitation After Stroke: A Systematic Review","Electroencephalography-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) that allow the control of robotic devices to support stroke patients during upper limb rehabilitation are increasingly popular. Hand rehabilitation is focused on improving dexterity and fine motor control and is a core approach for helping stroke survivors regain activities of daily living. This systematic review examines recent developments in BCI-robotic systems for hand rehabilitation and identifies evidence-based clinical studies on stroke patients. A search for January 2010-October 2019 articles using Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PEDro, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore and Cochrane Library databases was performed. The selection criteria included BCI-hand robotic systems for rehabilitation in various development stages involving tests on healthy human subjects or stroke survivors. Data fields include those related to study design, participant characteristics, technical specifications of the system, and clinical outcome measures. 30 studies were identified as eligible for qualitative review and among these, 11 studies involved testing a BCI-hand robot on chronic and subacute stroke patients. Statistically significant improvements in motor assessment scores relative to controls were observed for two BCI-hand robot interventions. The degree of robot control for the majority of studies was limited to triggering the device to perform grasping or pinching movements using motor imagery. Most employed a combination of kinaesthetic and visual response via the robotic device and display screen, respectively, to match feedback to motor imagery. Most studies on BCI-robotic systems for hand rehabilitation report systems at prototype or pre-clinical stages of development. Some studies report statistically significant improvements in functional recovery after stroke, but there is a need to develop a standard protocol for assessing technical and clinical outcomes so that the necessary evidence base on efficiency and efficacy can be developed.","Baniqued, P.

960,"Evaluating the utility of tumour mutational signatures for identifying hereditary colorectal cancer and polyposis syndrome carriers","Objective: Germline pathogenic variants (PVs) in the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes and the base excision repair genes NTHL1 and MUTYH underlie hereditary CRC and polyposis syndromes. We evaluate the robustness and discriminatory potential of tumour mutational signatures in colorectal cancers (CRCs) for identifying germline PV carriers. Design: Whole exome sequencing of FFPE CRC tissue was performed on hereditary CRC PV carriers (14 MMR, 6 biallelic MUTYH, and 1 biallelic NTHL1), 9 sporadic MMR-deficient CRCs (MMRd controls) and 18 sporadic MMR-proficient CRCs (MMRp controls). COSMIC V3 Single Base Substitution (SBS) and Indel (ID) mutational signatures were calculated and assessed for their ability to differentiate CRCs that developed in carriers and non-carriers. Results: The combination of SBS18 and SBS36 contributing >23% of the signature profile was able to discriminate biallelic MUTYH carriers from MMRp and MMRd control CRCs with >99% confidence. Variant specific signatures SBS18 and SBS36 were identified for MUTYH p.Gly396Asp (p=0.015) and MUTYH p.Tyr179Cys (p=0.0012), respectively. SBS30 was significantly increased in a CRC from a biallelic NTHL1 carrier compared with MMRp and MMRd control CRCs. The combination of ID2, ID7, SBS15 and SBS1 could discriminate the 14 MMR PV carrier CRCs from the MMRp control CRCs, however, SBS and ID signatures, alone or in combination, could not provide complete discrimination between CRCs from MMR PV carriers and sporadic MMRd controls. Conclusion: Assessment of SBS and ID signatures can discriminate CRCs from MUTYH, NTHL1 and MMR PV carriers from non-carriers, demonstrating utility as a potential diagnostic and variant classification tool.","Georgeson, P.; Pope, B.

1001,"Identification of Familial Hodgkin Lymphoma Predisposing Genes Using Whole Genome Sequencing","Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a lymphoproliferative malignancy of B-cell origin that accounts for 10% of all lymphomas. Despite evidence suggesting strong familial clustering of HL, there is no clear understanding of the contribution of genes predisposing to HL. In this study, whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on 7 affected and 9 unaffected family members from three HL-prone families and variants were prioritized using our Familial Cancer Variant Prioritization Pipeline (FCVPPv2). WGS identified a total of 98564, 170550 and 113654 variants which were reduced by pedigree-based filtering to 18158, 465 and 26465 in families I, II and III, respectively. In addition to variants affecting amino acid sequences, variants in promoters, enhancers, transcription factors binding sites and microRNA seed sequences were identified from upstream, downstream, 5 and 3 prime untranslated regions. A panel of 565 cancer predisposing and other cancer-related genes and of 2383 high-risk HL genes were also screened in these families to aid further prioritization. Pathway analysis of segregating genes with CADD (Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion Tool) scores > 20 was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software which implicated several candidate genes in pathways involved in B-cell activation and proliferation and in the network of Cancer, Hematological disease and Immunological Disease. We used the FCVPPv2 for further in silico analysis and prioritized 45 coding and 79 non-coding variants from the three families. Further literature-based analysis allowed us to constrict this list to one rare germline variant each in families I and II and two in family III. Functional studies were conducted on the candidate from family I in a previous study, resulting in the identification and functional validation of a novel heterozygous missense variant in the tumor suppressor gene DICER1 as potential HL predisposition factor. We aim to identify the individual genes responsible for predisposition in the remaining two families and will functionally validate these in further studies.","Srivastava, A.; Giangiobbe, S.; Kumar, A.; Dymerska, D.; Behnisch, W.; Witzens-Harig, M.; Lubinski, J.; Hemminki, K.; Foersti, A.; Bandapalli, O.

947,"A brief report: de novo copy number variants in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder","Background: Recent case-control genetic studies of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have implicated common and rare genetic risk alleles, highlighting the polygenic and complex aetiology of this neurodevelopmental disorder. Studies of other neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Tourette disorder, developmental delay/intellectual disability, and schizophrenia indicate that identification of specific risk alleles and additional insights into disorder biology can be gained by studying non-inherited de novo variation. In this study, we aimed to identify large de novo copy number variants (CNVs) in children with ADHD. Methods: Children with a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD and their parents were genotyped and included in this sample. We used PennCNV to call large (>200kb) CNVs and identified those calls that were present in the proband and absent in both biological parents. Results: In 305 parent-offspring trios, we detected 14 de novo CNVs in 13 probands, giving a mutation rate of 4.6% and a per individual rate of 4.3%. This rate is higher than published reports in controls and similar to those observed for ASD, schizophrenia and Tourette disorder. We also identified de novo mutations at 4 genomic loci (15q13.1-13.2 duplication, 16p13.11 duplication, 16p12.2 deletion and 22q11.21 duplication) that have previously been implicated in other neurodevelopmental disorders, two of which (16p13.11 and 22q11.21) have also been implicated in case-control ADHD studies. Conclusions: Our study complements ADHD case-control genomic analyses and demonstrates the need for larger parent-offspring trio genetic studies to gain further insights into the complex aetiology of ADHD.","Martin, J.; Hosking, G.; Wadon, M.; Agha, S.

952,"Hepatitis C Core Antigen test as an alternative for diagnosing HCV infection: mathematical model and cost-effectiveness analysis","Background: The cost and complexity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing is a significant barrier for the diagnosis and treatment of patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). We investigated the cost-effectiveness of various testing strategies using antigen as an alternative to PCR. Methods: We developed a mathematical model for HCV to estimate the number of newly diagnosed individuals and cases of different stages of liver disease. We compared the following testing strategies: antibody test followed by PCR in case of positive antibody (baseline strategy); antibody test followed by HCV-antigen test (antibody-antigen); antigen test alone; and PCR test alone. We conducted cost-effectiveness analyses considering the costs of HCV testing (of both infected and uninfected individuals) (A1), liver-related complications (A2) and all costs including HCV treatment (A3). The model was parameterized for the country of Georgia, and several sensitivity analyses were conducted to generalize the findings for different settings. Results: Using the current standard of testing, 89% of infected individuals were detected. Comparatively, antibody-antigen and antigen testing alone detected 86% and 88% of infected individuals, respectively. PCR testing alone detected 91% of the infected individuals with the remaining 9% dying or spontaneously recovering before testing. In analysis A1, antibody-antigen testing was not found to be essentially cheaper compared to the baseline strategy. In analysis A2, strategies using PCR were cheaper than antigen-based strategies. In analysis A3, antibody-antigen testing was the cheapest strategy, followed by the baseline strategy, and PCR testing alone. Conclusion: Antigen testing, either following a positive antibody test or alone, performed almost as well as the current practice of HCV testing. The cost-effectiveness of these strategies strongly depends on the inclusion of treatment costs.","Sadeghimehr, M.; Keiser, O.; Negro, F.; Butsashvili, M.; Shilton, S.; Tskhomelidze, I.; Tsereteli, M.; Bertisch, B.; Estill, J.",20191215,"Epidemiology","10.1101/2019.12.12.19014621",1,"Barbara Bertisch","Institute of global health, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland- Checkin Helvetiaplatz, Zurich, Switzerland","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014621v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014621v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"We reviewed the literature and contacted persons directly involved in the elimination project in the country of Georgia who helped to interpret already published  data."
964,"Retrospective Assessment of Deep Neural Networks for Skin Tumor Diagnosis","BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to validate the performance of algorithm (http://rcnn.modelderm.com) for the diagnosis of benign and malignant skin tumors. METHODS: With external validation dataset (43 disorders; 40,435 clinical images from 10,450 patients; January 1, 2008 - March 31, 2019), we compared the prediction of algorithm with the clinical diagnosis of 65 attending physicians at the time of biopsy request. RESULTS: For binary-task classification of determining malignancy, the AUC of the algorithm was 0.863(95% CI 0.852-0.875) with unprocessed clinical photographs. The sensitivity/specificity/positive predictive value/negative predictive value of the algorithm at the predefined high-sensitivity and high-specificity threshold were 79.1%(76.8-81.3)/77.0%(76.1-77.8)/31.3%(30.3-32.3)/96.5%(96.2-96.9) and 62.6%(59.9-65.2)/90.0%(89.4-90.6)/45.3%(43.5-47.2)/94.8%(94.4-95.1), respectively. The sensitivity/specificity calculated by the clinical diagnosis of attending physicians were 88.1%/83.8% (Top-3) and 70.2%/95.6% (Top-1), which were superior to the algorithm. For multi-task classification, the mean Top-1,2,3 accuracies of the algorithm were 42.6{+/-}20.7%, 56.1{+/-}22.8%, 61.9{+/-}22.9%, and those of clinical diagnosis were 65.4{+/-}17.7%, 73.9{+/-}16.6%, 74.7{+/-}16.6%, respectively.

955,"ULCERATIVE COLITIS-DERIVED COLONOID CULTURE: A Multi-Mineral-Approach to Improve Barrier Protein Expression","Background: Recent studies demonstrated that Aquamin(R), a calcium-, magnesium-, and multiple trace element-rich natural product, improves barrier structure and function in colonoids obtained from the tissue of healthy subjects. The goal of the present study was to determine if the colonic barrier could be improved in tissue from subjects with ulcerative colitis (UC). Methods: Colonoid cultures were established with tissue from 9 individuals with UC. The colonoids were then incubated for a 2-week period under control conditions (i.e., in culture medium with a final calcium concentration of 0.25 mM) or in the same medium supplemented with Aquamin(R) to provide 1.5 - 4.5 mM calcium. Effects on differentiation and barrier protein expression were determined using several approaches: phase-contrast & scanning electron microscopy, quantitative histology & immunohistology, mass spectrometry-based proteome assessment and transmission electron microscopy. Results: Aquamin(R)-treated colonoids demonstrated a modest up-regulation of tight junctional proteins but stronger induction of adherens junction proteins and desmosomal proteins. Increased desmosomes were seen at the ultrastructural level. Proteomic analysis also demonstrated increased expression of basement membrane proteins and hemidesmosomal components. Proteins expressed at the apical surface (mucins and trefoils) were also increased as were several additional proteins with anti-microbial activity or that modulate inflammation. Conclusion: A majority of individuals including patients with UC do not reach the recommended daily intake for calcium and other minerals. The findings presented here suggest that adequate mineral intake might improve the colonic barrier.","Aslam, M. N.; Mcclintock, S. D.; Attili, D.; Pandya, S.; Rehman, H.; Nadeem, D.

961,"miRNA profiling in renal carcinoma suggest the existence of a group of pro-angionenic tumors in localized clear cell renal carcinoma","Renal cell carcinoma comprises a variety of entities, the most common being the clear-cell, papillary and chromophobe subtypes. These subtypes are related to different clinical evolution; however, most therapies have been developed for clear-cell carcinoma and there is not a specific treatment based on different subtypes. In this study, one hundred and sixty-four paraffin samples from primary nephrectomies for localized tumors were analyzed. MiRNAs were isolated and measured by microRNA arrays. Significance Analysis of Microarrays and Consensus Cluster algorithm were used to characterize different renal subtypes. The analyses showed that chromophobe renal tumors are a homogeneous group characterized by an overexpression of miR 1229, miR 10a, miR 182, miR 1208, miR 222, miR 221, miR 891b, miR 629-5p and miR 221-5p. On the other hand, clear cell renal carcinomas presented two different groups inside this histological subtype, with differences in miRNAs that regulate focal adhesion, transcription, apoptosis and angiogenesis processes. Specifically, one of the defined groups had an overexpression of proangiogenic microRNAs miR185, miR126 and miR130a. In conclusion, differences in miRNA expression profiles between histological renal subtypes were established. In addition, clear cell renal carcinomas had different expression of proangiogenic miRNAs. With the emergence of antiangiogenic drugs, these differences could be used as therapeutic targets in the future or as a selection method for tailoring personalized treatments.","Trilla-Fuertes, L.; Miranda, N.; Castellano, D.; Lopez-Vacas, R.; Farfan Tello, C.

958,"Patient-derived ovarian cancer organoids mimic clinical response and exhibit heterogeneous inter- and intrapatient drug responses","Purpose - There remains an unmet need for preclinical models to enable personalized therapy for ovarian cancer (OC) patients. Recently, patient-derived organoid (PDO) cultures of patients with OC have been established that faithfully represent the histopathological features and genomic landscape of the patient tumor. In this study, we evaluate the capacity of OC PDOs to predict clinical drug response and functional consequences of tumor heterogeneity. Experimental design - 36 genomically characterized PDOs from 23 patients with known clinical histories were exposed to chemotherapeutics and targeted drugs. Results - OC PDOs maintained genomic features of the original tumor lesion and recapitulated patient response to neoadjuvant carboplatin and paclitaxel combination treatment, according to distinct clinical outcomes (histopathological, biochemical and radiological). PDOs displayed inter- as well as intrapatient drug response heterogeneity, which could in part be explained by genetic aberrations. All PDOs were resistant to PARP-inhibitors, in accordance with homologous recombination pathway fidelity and genome-wide mutation context. KRAS, BRAF and NRAS mutation status predicted response to BRAF-inhibitor vemurafenib and pan-HER-inhibitor afatinib, and explained differential response among four PDOs derived from distinct tumor locations of an individual patient. Importantly, PDO drug screening identified sensitivity to at least one drug for the majority of patients (88%). Conclusions - OC PDOs are a valuable preclinical model system that can provide insights in drug response for individual patients with OC, complementary to genetic testing. Generating PDOs of multiple tumor locations can improve clinical decision making and increase our knowledge on genetic and drug response heterogeneity.","De Witte, C.

965,"Biological age in UK Biobank: biomarker composition and prediction of mortality, coronary heart disease and hospital admissions","Background: Age is the strongest risk factor for most chronic diseases, and yet individuals may age at different rates biologically. A biological age formed from biomarkers may be a stronger risk factor than chronological age and understanding what factors contribute to it could provide insight into new opportunities for disease prevention. Methods and findings: Among 480,019 UK Biobank participants aged 40-70 recruited in 2006-2010 and followed up for 6-12 years via linked death registry and secondary care records, a subpopulation of 141,254 (29.4%) non-smoking adults in good health and with no medication use or disease history at baseline were identified. Independent components of 72 biomarkers measured at baseline were characterised by principal component analysis. The Klemera Doubal method (KDM), which derived a weighted sum of biomarker principal components based on the strengths of their linear associations with chronological age, was used to derive sex-specific biological ages in this healthy subpopulation. The proportions of the overall biological and chronological age effects on mortality, coronary heart disease and age-related non-fatal hospital admissions (based on a hospital frailty index) that were explained by biological age were assessed using log-likelihoods of proportional hazards models. Reduced lung function, reduced kidney function, slower reaction time, lower insulin-like-growth factor 1, lower hand grip strength and higher blood pressure were key contributors to biological age (explaining the highest percentages of its variance) in both men and women, while lower albumin, higher sex hormone-binding globulin and lower muscle mass in men, and higher liver enzymes, blood lipids and HbA1c in women were also important. Across both sexes, a 51-principal component biological age explained 66%, 80% and 63% of the age effects on mortality, coronary heart disease and hospital admissions, respectively. Restricting the biological age to the 12-13 key biomarkers corresponding to the 10 most importantly contributing principal components resulted in little change in these proportions for women, but a reduction to 53%, 63% and 50%, respectively, for men. Conclusions: This study identified that markers of impaired function in a range of organs account for a substantial proportion of the apparent effect of age on disease and hospital admissions. It supports a broader, multi-system approach to research and prevention of diseases of ageing.","Chan, M.

967,"Temporal trends in public mass shootings: high-capacity magazines significantly increase fatality counts, and are becoming more prevalent","Background: There has been disagreement in the literature regarding whether public mass shootings are becoming more frequent, or more deadly, and whether high-capacity magazine (HCM) weaponry is associated with increased fatalities. Objective: We examined the 85 non-felony- and non-gang-related mass shootings with at least four people shot and killed that occurred in public places between 1995 to 2018 to examine the frequency and deadliness of public mass shootings, as well as the role of HCM weaponry in fatalities. Findings: The per-capita rate of public mass shootings with at least four people killed has not significantly increased since 1995 (Negative Binomial linear regression p=0.20), but public mass shootings with at least six people killed have been increasing by 6.9% per year (p=0.01). Public mass shootings are becoming significantly more deadly, with fatalities per incident increasing by 4.5% per year (truncated Negative Binomial log-linear regression p<0.001). Use of HCM weaponry banned during the 1994 to 2004 Federal Assault Weapons Ban (FAWB) increased fatality counts on average by 1.9 times, and total number shot by 3.3 times (non-parametric bootstrap comparison of means (NPBCM), p < 0.001 in both cases). In these incidents, HCM pistols were as deadly as assault rifles. The fraction of firearms involving HCMs used by perpetrators more than doubled after the lapse of the federal ban, from 25% during the ban to 59% after (Binomial factor regression, p<0.001).

957,"Integrated Bioinformatic Approach to Identify Potential Biomarkers against Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis","Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic and progressive lung disease that leads to gradual decline in lung function. The molecular mechanism and risk factors of this disease are still obscure. Poorly understood etiology of this disease is the major obstacle in the identification of potential biomarkers and drug targets. In this study, microarray gene expression data of normal and IPF patient has been utilized for the statistical analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with a view to identifying potential molecular signatures using network-based system. Then their functional enrichment analysis revealed their predominant involvement in transcription, protein acetylation, extracellular matrix organization, apoptic process, inflammatory response etc. Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network revealed (UBC, PTEN, SOS1, PTK2, FGFR1, YAP1, FOXO1, RACK1, BMP4 and CD44) as hub proteins in IPF. Subsequent regulatory network analysis suggested (E2F1, STAT3, PPARG, MEF2A, FOXC1, GATA3, YY1, GATA2, NFKB1, and FOXL1) as the best regulatory transcriptional signatures and (hsa-mir-155-5p, hsa-mir-16-5p, hsa-mir-17-5p, hsa-mir-19a-3p, hsa-mir-192-5p, hsa-mir-92a-3p, hsa-mir-26b-5p, hsa-mir-335-5p, hsa-mir-124-3p, and hsa-let-7b-5p) as the best post-transcriptional signatures. This study represents proteome and RNA signatures of IPF which might be useful to uphold the present efforts in the discovery of potential biomarkers and treatments of this disease.","Ullah, M.

963,"A genome-wide association study of polycystic ovary syndrome identified from electronic health records","Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder affecting women of reproductive age. Previous studies have identified genetic variants associated with PCOS identified by different diagnostic criteria. The Rotterdam Criteria is the broadest and able to identify the most PCOS cases. Objectives: To identify novel associated genetic variants, we extracted PCOS cases and controls from the electronic health records (EHR) based on the Rotterdam Criteria and performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS). Study Design: We developed a PCOS phenotyping algorithm based on the Rotterdam criteria and applied it to three EHR-linked biobanks to identify cases and controls for genetic study. In discovery phase, we performed individual GWAS using the Geisinger's MyCode and the eMERGE cohorts, which were then meta-analyzed. We attempted validation of the significantly association loci (P<1x10-6) in the BioVU cohort. All association analyses used logistic regression, assuming an additive genetic model, and adjusted for principal components to control for population stratification. An inverse-variance fixed effect model was adopted for meta-analyses. Additionally, we examined the top variants to evaluate their associations with each criterion in the phenotyping algorithm. We used STRING to identify protein-protein interaction network. Results: We identified 2,995 PCOS cases and 53,599 controls in total (2,742 cases and 51,438 controls from the discovery phase; 253 cases and 2,161 controls in the validation phase). GWAS identified one novel genome-wide significant variant rs17186366 (OR=1.37 [1.23,1.54], P=2.8x10-8) located near SOD2. Additionally, two loci with suggestive association were also identified: rs113168128 (OR=1.72 [1.42,2.10], P=5.2 x10-8), an intronic variant of ERBB4 that is independent from the previously published variants, and rs144248326 (OR=2.13 [1.52,2.86], P=8.45x10-7), a novel intronic variant in WWTR1. In the further association tests of the top 3 SNPs with each criterion in the PCOS algorithm, we found that rs17186366 was associated with polycystic and hyperandrogenism, while rs11316812 and rs144248326 were mainly associated with oligomenorrhea or infertility. Besides ERBB4, we also validated the association with DENND1A1. Conclusion: Through a discovery-validation GWAS on PCOS cases and controls identified from EHR using an algorithm based on Rotterdam criteria, we identified and validated a novel association with variants within ERBB4. We also identified novel associations nearby SOD2 and WWTR1. These results suggest the eGFR and Hippo pathways in the disease etiology. With previously identified PCOS-associated loci YAP1, the ERBB4-YAP1-WWTR1 network implicates the epidermal growth factor receptor and the Hippo pathway in the multifactorial etiology of PCOS.","Zhang, Y.; Ho, K.; Keaton, J.

959,"Post-Exertional Malaise in People with Chronic Cancer-Related Fatigue","Context: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a distressing and persistent sense of tiredness or exhaustion that interferes with usual functioning. Chronic CRF continues for months after curative cancer treatment is complete. Post-exertional malaise (PEM) is a worsening of symptoms after physical or mental activity, with limited investigations in people with chronic CRF. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to identify and describe self-reported incidences of PEM in people with chronic CRF. Methods: Participants (n=18) were eligible if they scored [&le;]34 on the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue scale and had a cancer-related onset of fatigue. Participants completed a brief questionnaire to assess PEM over a 6-month time-frame (the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire - Post-Exertional Malaise; DSQ-PEM). In addition, a maximal exercise test was used to investigate self-reported symptom exacerbation (via an open-ended questionnaire) after strenuous physical exertion. Results: On the DSQ-PEM, three participants met previously defined scoring criteria, which included experiencing moderate to very severe symptoms at least half of the time, worsening of fatigue after minimal effort, plus a recovery duration of >24 h. Content analysis of responses to open-ended questionnaires identified five people who experienced a delayed recovery and symptoms of PEM after maximal exercise. Conclusion: A subset of people with chronic CRF (up to 33% in this sample) may experience PEM. Exercise specialists and health care professionals working with people with chronic CRF must be aware that PEM may be an issue. Symptom exacerbation after exercise should be monitored, and exercise should be tailored and adapted to limit the potential for harm.","Twomey, R.; Yeung, S. T.; Wrightson, J. G.; Millet, G.

939,"Screening of Diabetes and Hypertension Based on Retinal Fundus Photographs Using Deep Learning","Purpose: The aim of this study was to use deep learning to screen for hypertension and diabetes based on retinal fundus images. Methods: We collected 1160 retinal photographs which included 580 from patients with a diagnosis of hypertension or diabetes and 580 from normotensive and non-diabetic control. We divided this image dataset into (i) a development dataset to develop model and (ii) test dataset which were not present during the training process to assess model's performance. A binary classification model was trained by fine-tuning the classifier and the last convolution layer of deep residual network. Precision, recall, the area under the ROC (AUC), and the area under the Precision-Recall curve (AUPR) were used to evaluate the performance of the learned model. Results: When we used 3-channel color retinal photographs to train and test model, its prediction precision for diabetes or hypertension was 65.3%, the recall was 82.5%, the AUC was 0.745, and the AUPR was 0.742. When we used grayscale retinal photographs to train and test model, its prediction precision was 70.0%, the recall was 87.5%, the AUC was 0.803, and the AUPR was 0.779. Conclusions: Our study shows that trained deep learning model based on the retinal fundus photographs alone can be used to screen for diabetes and hypertension, although its current performance was not ideal.","He, W.; Dai, G.; Zhang, C.",20191214,"Ophthalmology","10.1101/2019.12.13.19013904",1,"Wei He","Dalian Medical University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19013904v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19013904v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"All data  referred to in the manuscript are fully available without restriction"
946,"Cerebrospinal fluid and plasma biomarkers in individuals at risk for genetic prion disease","BACKGROUND: Fluid biomarkers are important in the development of therapeutics to delay or prevent prion disease, but have not been systematically evaluated in pre-symptomatic individuals at risk for genetic prion disease. METHODS: We recruited pre-symptomatic individuals with pathogenic mutations in the prion protein gene (PRNP; N=27) and matched controls (N=16), to donate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood at multiple timepoints to a cohort study at Massachusetts General Hospital. We quantified total prion protein (PrP) and real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) prion seeding activity in CSF, and the neuronal damage markers total tau (T-tau) and neurofilament light chain (NfL) in both CSF and plasma. We compared these markers cross-sectionally between mutation carriers and controls, evaluated short-term test-retest reliability over 2-4 months, and conducted a pilot longitudinal study over 10-20 months for a subset of participants. FINDINGS: CSF PrP levels were stable on test-retest with a mean coefficient of variation of 7% both over 2-4 months in N=29 participants and over 10-20 months in N=10 participants. RT-QuIC was negative in 22/23 mutation carriers. The sole individual with positive RT-QuIC seeding activity at two study visits had steady CSF PrP levels and slightly increased tau and NfL concentrations compared with others, though still within the normal range, and remained asymptomatic one year later. Overall, tau and NfL showed no significant differences between mutation carriers and controls in either CSF or plasma. INTERPRETATION: CSF PrP will be interpretable as a pharmacodynamic readout of the effects of a PrP-lowering therapeutic in pre-symptomatic individuals, and may serve as a surrogate biomarker in a ""primary prevention"" trial paradigm. In contrast, current markers of prion seeding activity and of neuronal damage do not reliably cross-sectionally distinguish mutation carriers from controls, arguing against the feasibility of a ""secondary prevention"" paradigm in which trials specifically recruit pre-symptomatic participants with prodromal evidence of pathology.","Vallabh, S.

949,"Minimal transmission in an influenza A (H3N2) human challenge-transmission model with exposure events in a controlled environment","Uncertainty about the relative importance of modes of influenza transmission, particularly airborne droplet nuclei (aerosols), fuels controversy concerning recommendations for healthcare worker protection during pandemics. In-depth review by an expert panel, a proof-of-concept study, and an international workshop concluded that human challenge-transmission studies in well-controlled environments would be the most promising approach to fill this critical knowledge gap. Healthy, seronegative volunteer Donors (n=52) were randomly selected for intranasal challenge with influenza A/Wisconsin/67/2005 (H3N2). Seronegative Recipients randomized to Intervention (IR, n=40) or Control (CR, n=35) groups were exposed to Donors for four days. IRs wore face shields and hand sanitized frequently to limit large droplet and contact transmission. Intranasal inoculation produced an infection rate of 81% (42/52); 60% (25/42) of infected Donors had influenza-like illness, 14% (6/42) had fever, and 26% (11/42) had mild or no symptoms. Viral aerosol shedding was observed from 26% (11/42) of the infected Donors. One transmitted infection was confirmed by serology in a CR, yielding a SAR of 2.9% among CR, 0% in IR (p=0.47 for group difference), and 1.3% overall. The SAR observed was significantly less than 16% (p<0.001) expected based on the proof-of-concept study SAR considering that there were twice as many Donors and days of exposure. The main difference between these studies was mechanical building ventilation in the follow-on study, suggesting a possible role for aerosols. The low SAR suggests human challenge studies cannot provide definitive evidence regarding modes of transmission.","Nguyen-Van-Tam, J.

951,"Type 2 diabetes risks and determinants in 2nd generation migrants and mixed ethnicity people of South Asian and African Caribbean descent in the UK","Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) risk is markedly higher in UK South Asians (SA) and African Caribbeans (AC) compared to Europeans. Explanations for this excess are unclear. We therefore compared risks and determinants of T2DM in first- and second-generation (born in the UK) migrants, and in those of mixed ethnicity populations. Methods: Data from the UK Biobank, a large population-based cohort of volunteers aged 40-69, were used. T2DM was assigned using self-report and glycated haemoglobin. Ethnicity was self-assigned. Using logistic regression and mediation analysis, we compared T2DM between first- and second-generation migrants, and between mixed European/South Asians (MixESA), or mixed European/African Caribbeans (MixEAC) with both Europeans and SA or AC respectively. Results: T2DM prevalence was three to five times higher in SA and AC compared with Europeans [OR (95%CI): 4.80(3.60,6.40) and 3.30(2.70,4.10) respectively]. T2DM was 20-30% lower in second versus first generation SA and AC migrants [0.78(0.60,1.01) and 0.71(0.57,0.87) respectively]. T2DM in mixed populations was lower than comparator ethnic minority groups [MixESA versus SA 0.29(0.21,0.39), MixEAC versus AC 0.48(0.37,0.62)] and higher than Europeans, in MixESA 1.55(1.11, 2.17), and in MixEAC 2.06 (1.53, 2.78). Improved adiposity patterns in second generation migrants made an important contribution to risk reduction. Greater socioeconomic deprivation accounted for 17% and 42% of the excess risk of T2DM in MixESA and MixEAC compared to Europeans, respectively. Conclusion: Excess T2DM risks in South Asians and African Caribbeans compared with Europeans in the UK are attenuated by ~20% in second-generation migrants, demonstrating the marked benefits of favourable changes in environmental risk factors. T2DM prevalence in people of mixed ethnicity was also raised compared with Europeans, but considerably less than in the ethnic minority group; persistent socioeconomic disadvantage accounted for some of the residual excess.","Farmaki, A.-E.; Garfield, V.; Eastwood, S.

1004,"All-cause mortality and causes of death in the Swiss Hepatitis C Cohort Study","Background & Aims: With the introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA), mortality rates and causes of death among persons with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are likely to change over time. However, the emergence of such trends may be delayed by the relatively slow progression of chronic hepatitis C. To date, detailed analyses of cause-specific mortality among HCV-infected persons over time remain limited. Methods: We evaluated changes in causes of death among the Swiss Hepatitis C Cohort Study (SCCS) participants, from 2008 to 2016. We analysed risk factors for all-cause and cause-specific mortality, accounting for changes in treatment, fibrosis stage and use of injectable drugs over time. Mortality ascertainment was completed by linking lost-to-follow-up participants to the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (SFSO) death registry. Results: We included 4,700 SCCS participants, of whom 478 died between 2008 and 2016. Linkage to the SFSO death registry substantially improved the information on causes of death (from 42% of deaths with unknown cause to 10% after linkage). Leading causes of death were liver failure (crude death rate 4.4/1000 person-years), liver cancer (3.4/1000 p-yrs) and non-liver cancer (2.8/1000 p-yrs), with an increasing proportion of cancer-related deaths over time. Cause-specific analysis showed that persons with sustained virologic response (SVR) were less at risk for liver-related mortality than those never treated or treated unsuccessfully. Conclusions: Although the expected decrease in mortality is not yet observable, causes of death among HCV-infected persons evolved over time. With the progressive widening of guidelines for DAA use, liver-related mortality is expected to decline in the future. Continued monitoring of cause-specific mortality will remain important to assess the long-term effect of DAA and to design effective interventions.","Roelens, M.; Bertisch, B.; Moradpour, D.; Cerny, A.; Semmo, N.; Schmid, P.; Mullhaupt, B.; Clerc, O.; Semela, D.; Junker, C.; Negro, F.; Keiser, O.; The Swiss Hepatitis C Cohort Study,  ",20191220,"Epidemiology","10.1101/2019.12.13.19014837",2,"Maroussia Roelens","Institute of Global Health, University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014837v2?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014837v2.full.pdf","cc_by",NA,"The data referred to in that manuscript is not publicly available."
969,"Disease progression modeling in Alzheimer's disease: insights from the shape of cognitive decline","Background: The characterizing symptom of Alzheimer disease (AD) is cognitive deterioration. While much recent work has focused on defining AD as a biological construct, most patients are still diagnosed, staged, and treated based on their cognitive symptoms. But the cognitive capability of a patient at any time throughout this deterioration will not directly reflect the disease state, but rather the effect of the cognitive decline on the patient's predisease cognitive capability. Patients with high predisease cognitive capabilities tend to score better on cognitive tests relative to patients with low predisease cognitive capabilities at the same disease stage. Thus, a single assessment with a cognitive test is not adequate for determining the stage of an AD patient. Methods and Findings: I developed a joint statistical model that explicitly modeled disease stage, baseline cognition, and the patients' individual changes in cognitive ability as latent variables. The developed model takes the form of a nonlinear mixed-effects model. Maximum-likelihood estimation in this model induces a data-driven criterion for separating disease progression and baseline cognition. Applied to data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the model estimated a timeline of cognitive decline in AD that spans approximately 15 years from the earliest subjective cognitive deficits to severe AD dementia. It was demonstrated how direct modeling of latent factors that modify the observed data patterns provide a scaffold for understanding disease progression, biomarkers and treatment effects along the continuous time progression of disease. Conclusions: The suggested framework enables direct interpretations of factors that modify cognitive decline. The results give new insights to the value of biomarkers for staging patients and suggest alternative explanations for previous findings related to accelerated cognitive decline among highly educated patients and patients on symptomatic treatments.","Raket, L.

1008,"Changes in dental care behaviour between 2002 and 2012 and its association with complete dentition in men and women in Switzerland","Background: In industrialized countries, the awareness of oral hygiene measures has increased and the number of missing teeth has been decreasing. A higher number of missing teeth was reported by women despite their more intense oral hygiene. The aim of this study was to compare oral hygiene and its association to oral health with a complete dentition in women and men in Switzerland between 2002 and 2012. Methods: Weighted data from the Swiss-Health-Surveys in 2002 and 2012 were used to quantify the number of missing teeth, the prevalence of prosthetic dental restorations, dental visits and tooth brushing. Sex-stratified logistic regression analysis was performed for subjects aged [&ge;]65-yrs to assess associations between a complete or functional dentition and dental visits, frequency of tooth brushing and socio-demographic factors. Results: In all age groups, the prevalence of dental visits and frequent tooth brushing increased and the prevalence of missing teeth decreased between 2002 and 2012. In 2012, the prevalence of a complete dentition was 87% in men and 85.3% women aged <25-yrs and 8.2% or 15.6% in the [&ge;]85-yrs old. Prevalence of dental visits varied between 45.2% in the [&ge;]85-yrs in 2002 and 73.1% in the 55-65-yrs old in 2012 in women and between 26.0% in the [&ge;]85-yrs in 2002 and 68.1% in the 55-65-yrs old in 2012 in men. Frequent tooth brushing was more often reported by women (87.7%/81.4%) than men (73.5%/65.5%) in 2012 and 2002. Subjects aged [&ge;]65-yrs, who visited their dentist within the last year, were twice as likely to have a functional dentition compared to subjects not having visited their dentist in the last year (men: 2.10, 1.68-2.63; women: 2.16, 1.73-2.70) in 2012, in 2002 this association was even stronger. A complete dentition was also associated with high income, higher education and non-smoking in 2012 in men and women. Conclusion: In women and men, oral hygiene practices improved and the mean number of missing teeth substantially decreased between 2002 and 2012. Although women followed oral hygiene recommendations more closely than men, they still do not have a higher prevalence of a complete dentition, except in the oldest age groups.","Schneider, C.; Zitzmann, N.; Zemp, E.",20191221,"Dentistry And Oral Medicine","10.1101/2019.12.13.19014878",1,"Cornelia Schneider","University of Basel","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014878v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014878v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"The data that support the findings of this study are available from the Swiss federal office of statistics but restrictions apply to the availability of these data, which were used under license for the current study, and so are not publicly available.

962,"Clinical validity of expanded carrier screening: evaluating the gene-disease relationship in more than 200 conditions","Objective: Clinical guidelines consider expanded carrier screening (ECS) to be an acceptable method of carrier screening. However, broader guideline support and payer adoption require evidence for associations between the genes on ECS panels and the conditions for which they aim to identify carriers. We applied a standardized framework for evaluation of gene-disease association to assess the clinical validity of conditions screened by ECS panels. Methods: The ClinGen gene curation framework was used to assess genetic and experimental evidence of associations between 208 genes and conditions screened on two commercial ECS panels. Twenty-one conditions were previously classified by ClinGen, and the remaining 187 were evaluated by curation teams at two laboratories. To ensure consistent application of the framework across the laboratories, concordance was evaluated on a subset of conditions. Results: All 208 evaluated conditions met the evidence threshold for supporting a gene-disease association. Furthermore, 203 of 208 (98%) achieved the strongest (Definitive) level of gene-disease association. All conditions evaluated by both commercial laboratories were similarly classified. Conclusion: Assessment using the ClinGen standardized framework revealed strong evidence of gene-disease association for conditions on two ECS panels. This result establishes the disease-level clinical validity of the panels considered herein.","Balzotti, M.; Meng, L.; Muzzey, D.; Johansen Taber, K.; Beauchamp, K.; Myriad Genetics Curation Team,  ; Baylor Genetics Curation Team,  ; Mar-Heyming, R.; Buckley, B.; Moyer, K.",20191215,"Genetic And Genomic Medicine","10.1101/2019.12.13.19014894",1,"Katherine Johansen Taber","Myriad Women\'s Health","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014894v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014894v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"All gene-disease associations have been submitted to ClinGen for public posting."

985,"At what geographic scales does agricultural alienation amplify foodborne disease outbreaks? A statistical test for 25 U.S. states, 1970-2000","The modern economy is driving multiple environmental and social crises across the globe. Capital accumulation externalizes the myriad damage associated with commodity production to ecosystems, labor, public health, and governments across jurisdictions. A growing literature shows multinational agriculture, a major sector of the economy, plays a fundamental role in disrupting the ecological cycles upon which communities across the globe depend. We report here one of the first statistical tests of such an ecosocial rift. We used geometric morphometrics to characterize a parameter space in agricultural alienation across nature, human welfare, and industrial appropriation for 25 U.S. states, at five-year increments between 1970 and 2000. The first two relative warps of the analysis reproduce the long-documented shift in and out of the 1980s farming crisis. We found the crisis left the U.S. food system in a new configuration, with commodity crops replacing cropland pasture, greater farm debt load, overcapitalized inputs, and a relative decline in on-farm wages. To determine if such a shift had an epidemiological impact, we tested whether salmonellosis and shigellosis - two foodborne pathogens for which national incidence data across the study period were available - regressed against historical changes in this alienation space across geographic scale. The second relative warp for shigellosis showed a multivariate relationship with the alienation space, but significance failed to withstand a Bonferroni correction. The partial warps and Procrustes residuals of temporal trends in the alienation space likewise exhibited limited predictive capacity for outbreak size. In part these results may reflect sampling artifacts. Data availability limits both the number of years sampled and the variety of diseases tested. Nevertheless, our analyses demonstrate that metabolic rifts associated with specific modes of production can be rigorously investigated.","Okamoto, K. W.; Liebman, A.; Wallace, R.

987,"Development of a Mixture Model (SMM) Allowing for Smoothing Functions of Trajectories","In the health and social sciences, two types of mixture model have been widely used by researchers to identify heterogeneous trajectories of participants within a population: latent class growth analysis (LCGA) and the growth mixture model (GMM). Both methods parametrically model trajectories of individuals, and capture latent trajectory classes, by using an expectation-maximization (E-M) algorithm. However, parametric modeling of trajectories using polynomial functions or monotonic spline functions results in limited flexibility for modelling trajectories; as a result, group membership may not be classified accurately due to model misspecification. In this paper, we propose a mixture model (SMM) allowing for smoothing functions of trajectories using a modified E-M algorithm. In the E step, participants are reassigned to only one group for which the estimated trajectory is the most similar to the observed one; in the M step, trajectories are fitted using generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) with smoothing functions of time. This modified E-M algorithm is straightforward to implement using the recently released gamm4 macro in R. The SMM can incorporate time-varying covariates and be applied to longitudinal data with normal, Bernoulli, and Poisson distributions. Simulation results show favorable performance of the SMM in terms of classification of group membership. The proposed method is illustrated by its application to body mass index data of individuals followed from adolescence to young adulthood and the relationship with incidence of cardiometabolic disease.","Ding, M.",20191218,"Epidemiology","10.1101/2019.12.13.19014928",1,"Ming Ding","Harvard T.H.

1054,"A Systematic Review on Psychological and Biological Mediators Between Adversity and Psychosis: Potential Targets for Treatment","Various psychological and biological pathways have been proposed as mediators between childhood adverse events (CA) and psychosis. A systematic review of the evidence in this domain is needed. The aim of this work is to systematically review the evidence on psychological and biological mediators between CA and psychosis across the psychosis spectrum. This systematic review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (registration number: CRD42018100846). Articles published between 1979 and July 2019 were identified through a literature search in OVID (PsychINFO; Medline and Embase). The evidence by each analysis and each study results are presented by group of mediator categories found in the review. The percentage of total effect mediated was calculated. 47 studies were included, with a total of 79,668 from general population (GP) and 3,189 from clinical samples. The quality of studies was judged as 'fair'. Our results showed (i) solid evidence of mediation between CA and psychosis by negative cognitive schemas about the self, the world, and others (NS); by dissociation and other PTSD symptoms; (ii) evidence of al mediation through an affective pathway (affective dysregulation, anxiety, and depression) in GP; (iii) lack of studies exploring biological mediators. To conclude, we found evidence suggesting that various overlapping and not competing pathways contribute partially to the link between adversity and psychosis. Experiences of adversity, along with relevant mediators such as PTSD and mood related symptoms and NS, should be routinely assessed in patients with psychosis. Targeting such mediators through cognitive behavioural aproaches using trauma-focused therapy and/or pharmacological means could be a useful addition to the traditional treatment of positive symptoms.","Alameda, L.; Rodriguez, V.; Ewan, C.; Aas, M.; Trotta, G.; Spinazzola, E.; Marino, P.; Vorontsova, N.; Herane Vives, A.; Di Forti, M.; Morgan, C.; M.

984,"Interactive web application for plotting personalized prognosis prediction curves in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation using machine learning","Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is a curative treatment option for malignant hematological disorders. Transplant clinicians estimate patient-specific prognosis empirically in clinical practice based on previous studies on similar patients. However, this approach does not provide objective data. The present study primarily aimed to develop a tool capable of providing accurate personalized prognosis prediction after allo-HCT in an objective manner. We succeeded in generating personalized prognosis prediction curves of 1-year overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), relapse/progression, and non-relapse mortality (NRM) adjusted for new allo-HCT candidates by eight pre-transplant factors using our interactive web application (https://predicted-os-after-transplantation.shinyapps.io/RSF_model/). A random survival forest model using the data of patients who underwent allo-HCT at our institution was applied to develop this application. To assess its predictive performance, the entire cohort (363 cases) was split into a training cohort (70%) to develop the predictive model and test cohort (30%) to confirm its performance time-sequentially. The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves for 1-year OS, PFS, relapse/progression, and NRM in test cohort were 0.70, 0.72, 0.73, and 0.77, respectively. In conclusion, the new web application could allow transplant clinicians to inform a new allo-HCT candidate of the objective personalized prognosis prediction and facilitate decision-making.","Okamura, H.; Nakamae, M.; Koh, S.; Nanno, S.; Nakashima, Y.; Koh, H.; Nakane, T.; Hirose, A.; Hino, M.; Nakamae, H.",20191218,"Hematology","10.1101/2019.12.14.19014654",1,"Hiroshi Okamura","Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.14.19014654v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.14.19014654v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc",NA,"The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are not publicly available due to the ethically sensitive nature of the research.

979,"Educational attainment reduces the risk of suicide attempt among individuals with and without psychiatric disorders independent of cognition: a multivariable Mendelian randomization study with more than 815,000 participants","Background: Rates of suicidal ideation, attempts and completions are increasing and identifying causal risk factors continues to be a public health priority. Observational literature has shown that educational attainment (EA) and cognitive performance (CP) can influence suicide attempt risk; however, due to residual confounding and reverse causation, the causal nature of these relationships is unknown. Methods: We perform a multivariable two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to disentangle the effects of EA and CP on suicide attempt risk. We use summary statistics from recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of EA, CP, household income versus suicide attempt risk in individuals with and without mental disorders, with more than 815,000 combined study participants. Results: We found evidence that both EA and CP significantly reduced the risk of suicide attempt when considered separately in single variable MR (SVMR) (Model 1 EA odds ratio (OR), 0.524, 95% CI, 0.412-0.666, P = 1.07x10-7; CP OR, 0.714, 95% CI, 0.577-0.885, P = 0.002). When simultaneously analyzing EA, CA, and adjusting for household income but not comorbid mental disorders (Model 1), we found evidence that the direct effect of EA, independent of CP, on suicide attempt risk was greater than the total effect estimated by SVMR, with EA, independent of CP, significantly reducing the risk of suicide attempt by almost 66% (95% CI, 43%-79%); however, the effect of CP was no longer significant independent of EA (Model 1 EA OR, 0.342, 95% CI, 0.206-0.568, P = 1.61x10-4; CP OR, 1.182, 95% CI, 0.842-1.659, P = 0.333). Further, when accounting for comorbid mental disorders (Model 2), these results did not significantly change: we found EA significantly reduced the risk of suicide attempt by 55% (35%-68%), a lower point estimate but still within the 95% confidence interval of Model 1; the effect of CP was still not significant (Model 2 EA OR, 0.450, 95% CI, 0.314-0.644, P < 1.00x10-4; CP OR, 1.143, 95% CI, 0.803-1.627, P = 0.475). Conclusions: Our results show that even after accounting for comorbid mental disorders and adjusting for household income, EA, but not CP, is a causal risk factor in suicide attempt. These findings could have important implications for health policy and prevention programs aimed at reducing the increasing rates of suicide.","Rosoff, D. B.; Kaminsky, Z. A.; Lohoff, F.

983,"Application of a severity framework to 176 genes on an expanded carrier screening panel","Background Disease severity is considered to be an important factor for inclusion of diseases on expanded carrier screening (ECS) panels. Evaluating severity requires an objective, systematic method. Here, we applied a validated algorithm that objectively categorizes disease severity into one of four categories-profound, severe, moderate, and mild-to 176 genes on a clinically available ECS panel. Methods Eight genetic counselors (GCs) working in pairs, followed by four medical geneticists (MDs) working in pairs, applied the algorithm to subsets of the 176 genes. Results Upon initial GC and MD review, 107/176 genes (61%) and 133/176 genes (76%), respectively, had concordant classifications, with consensus reached for all genes after collaborative review. Final severity classifications were 68 (39%) profound, 71 (40%) severe, 36 (20%) moderate, and one (1%) mild. No classification biases were detected within the GC or MD pairs. Conclusion This study illustrates an approach to severity classification for large sets of Mendelian genes. The observed level of initial discordance demonstrates the complexity of severity and underscores the importance of collaboration involving multiple clinicians. Severity classification, in addition to other factors suggested by ACOG, is an important factor for laboratories to consider as they aim to design clinically valid ECS panels.","Arjunan, A.; Bellerose, H.; Johansen Taber, K.; Torres, R.; Hoffman, J.

993,"Machine learning applied to atopic dermatitis transcriptome reveals distinct therapy-dependent modification of the keratinocyte immunophenotype","Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) arises from a complex interaction between an impaired epidermal barrier, environmental exposures, and the infiltration of Th1/Th2/Th17/Th22 T cells. Transcriptomic analysis has advanced understanding of gene expression in cells and tissues. However, molecular quantitation of cytokine transcripts does not predict the importance of a specific pathway in AD or cellular responses to different inflammatory stimuli. Objective: To understand changes in keratinocyte transcriptomic programmes in human cutaneous disease during development of inflammation and in response to treatment. Methods: We performed in silico deconvolution of the whole-skin transcriptome. Using co-expression clustering and machine learning tools, we resolved the gene expression of bulk skin (n=7 datasets, n=406 samples), firstly, into unsupervised keratinocyte immune response phenotypes and, secondly, into 19 cutaneous cell signatures of purified populations from publicly available datasets. Results: We identify three unique transcriptomic programmes in keratinocytes, KC1, KC2, KC17, characteristic to immune signalling from disease-associated helper T cells. We cross-validate those signatures across different skin inflammatory conditions and disease stages and demonstrate that the keratinocyte response during treatment is therapy dependent. Broad spectrum treatment with ciclosporin ameliorated the KC17 response in AD lesions to a non-lesional immunophenotype, without altering KC2. Conversely, the specific anti-Th2 therapy, dupilumab, reversed the KC2 immunophenotype. Conclusion: Our analysis of transcriptomic signatures in cutaneous disease biopsies reveals the complexity of keratinocyte programming in skin inflammation and suggests that the perturbation of a single axis of immune signal alone may be insufficient to resolve keratinocyte immunophenotype abnormalities.","Clayton, K.; Vallejo, A.

977,"Confidence in perceptual decision-making is preserved in schizophrenia","Metacognition is the set of reflexive processes allowing humans to evaluate the accuracy of their mental operations. Deficits in synthetic metacognition have been described in schizophrenia using mostly narrative assessment and linked to several key symptoms. Here, we assessed metacognitive performance by asking individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (N=20) and matched healthy participants (N = 21) to perform a visual discrimination task and subsequently report confidence in their performance. Metacognitive performance was defined as the adequacy between visual discrimination performance and confidence. Bayesian analyses revealed equivalent metacognitive performance in the two groups despite a weaker association between confidence and trajectory tracking during task execution among patients. These results were reproduced using a bounded evidence accumulation model which showed similar decisional processes in the two groups. The inability to accurately attune confidence to perceptual decisions in schizophrenia remains to be experimentally demonstrated, along with the way such impairments may underpin functional deficits.","Faivre, N.; Roger, M.; Pereira, M.; De Gardelle, V.; Vergnaud, J.-C.; Passerieux, C.; Roux, P.",20191218,"Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology","10.1101/2019.12.15.19014969",1,"Nathan Faivre","Universite Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, LPNC UMR 5105","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.15.19014969v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.15.19014969v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"The experimental paradigm and analysis plan detailed below were registered prior to data

989,"Public Perceptions of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics in Medicine","Objective: To understand better the public perception and comprehension with medical technology such as artificial intelligence and robotic surgery. Additionally, to identify sensitivity to, and comfort with, the use of AI and robotics in medicine a in order to ensure acceptability and quality of counseling and to guide future development. Subjects and Methods: A survey was conducted on a convenience sample of visitors to the Minnesota State Fair (n = 264). The survey investigated participant beliefs on the capabilities of AI and robotics in medicine and their comfort with such technology. Participants were randomized to receive one of two similar surveys. In the first a diagnosis was made by a physician and in the second by an AI application in order to compare confidence in human and computer-based diagnosis. Results: The median age of participants was 45 (IQR 28-59), 58% were female (n=154) vs. 42% male (n=110), 69% had completed at least a bachelor's degree, 88% were Caucasian (n=233) vs. 12% ethnic minorities (n=31) and were from 12 states in the US with most from the Upper Midwest. Participants had nearly equal trust in AI vs. physician diagnoses, however, they were significantly more likely to trust an AI diagnosis of cancer over a doctor's diagnosis when responding to the version of the survey that suggested an AI could make medical diagnosis (p = 9.32e-06). Though 55% of respondents (n=145) reported they were uncomfortable with automated robotic surgery the majority of the individuals surveyed (88%) mistakenly believed that partially autonomous surgery was already being performed. Almost all (94%) stated they would be willing to pay for an AI to review their medical imaging, if available. Conclusion: Most participants express confidence in AI providing medical diagnoses, sometimes even over human physicians. Participants generally expressed concern with surgical AI, but mistakenly believe it is already happening. As AI applications make their way into medical practice, health care providers should be cognizant of patient misconceptions and the sensitivity that patients have to how such technology is represented.","Stai, B.; Heller, N.; Mcsweeney, S.; Rickman, J.; Blake, P.; Vasdev, R.; Edgerton, Z.; Tejpaul, R.; Peterson, M.; Kalapara, A.; Regmi, S.; Papanikolopoulos, N.; Weight, C.",20191219,"Urology","10.1101/2019.12.15.19014985",1,"Bethany Stai","University of Minnesota","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.15.19014985v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.15.19014985v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"The full survey responses are available to researchers upon reasonable request."

PGIs often cause decrease in urine output (UO), the mechanism of which is like that of PDA closure. We hypothesized that PGI-induced decrease in UO predicts PDA closure. Design Prospective, cohort Setting Level III NICU Methods We prospectively enrolled 40 preterm neonates (less than or equal to 34 weeks gestation) with clinical and/or echocardiographic hemodynamically significant PDA (hsPDA), being treated with Ibuprofen or Paracetamol. We measured UO, weight, total fluid intake (TFI) at baseline and daily until 72 h. We performed echocardiogram at baseline and daily until PDA closure or end of treatment. We compared PDA-closed and PDA-open groups for change in UO, weight and TFI from baseline. Results PDA-closed and PDA-open groups had 28 and 12 neonates respectively. Median (Q1, Q3) percent decrease in UO was greater in PDA-closed vs PDA-open group: from baseline to 0-24 h [-44.87% (-54.79%, +0.04%) vs -15.03% (-27.91%, +49.11%)]; to 24-48 hours [-40.85% (-52.81%, +14.45%) vs. -2.57% (-24.82%, +61.73%) and to 48-72 hours [-32.77% (-49.4%, +32.22%) vs. +20.74% (-6.88%, +98.39%). PDA closed group had significantly greater percent decrease in weight by 72-h. Mixed linear model showed that group and time were independently associated with UO; but group*time interaction and covariates (echocardiographic hsPDA, weight, gestation, postnatal age) were not. Decrease in UO of 27% and 17% by 24-48 h and 48-72 h respectively, best predicted PDA closure. Conclusions Transient decrease in UO after treating hsPDA with a PGI may predict successful closure of PDA.","Goel, M.; Dutta, S.; Saini, S.

990,"A robust gene expression signature to predict proteasome inhibitor benefit in Multiple Myeloma","Many cancer drugs only benefit a subset of the patients that receive them, but are often associated with serious side effects. Predictive classification methods that can identify which patients will benefit from a specific treatment are therefore of great clinical utility. We here introduce a novel machine learning method to identify predictive gene expression signatures, based on the idea that patients who received different treatments but exhibit similar expression profiles can be used to model response to the alternative treatment. We use this method to predict proteasome inhibitor benefit in Multiple Myeloma (MM). In a dataset of 910 MM patients we identify a 14-gene expression signature that can successfully predict benefit to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, with a hazard ratio of 0.47 (p = 0.04) in class benefit, while in class no benefit the hazard ratio is 0.91 (p = 0.68). Importantly, we observe a similar classification performance (HR class benefit = 0.46, p = 0.04) in an independent patient cohort which was moreover measured on a different platform, demonstrating the robustness of the signature. Moreover, we find that the genes in the discovered signature are essential, as no equivalent signature can be found when they are excluded from the analysis. Multiple genes in the signature are linked to working mechanisms of proteasome inhibitors or MM disease progression. In conclusion, our method allows for identification of gene expression signatures that can aid in treatment decisions for MM patients and provide insight into the biological mechanism behind treatment benefit.","Ubels, J.; Sonneveld, P.; Van Vliet, M.

998,"Gender score development in a retrospective approach in the Berlin Aging Study II","In addition to biological sex, gender, the sociocultural dimension of being a woman or a man, plays a central role in health. However, there are so far no approaches to quantify gender in a retrospective manner in existing study datasets. We therefore aimed to develop a methodology that can be retrospectively applied to assess gender in existing cohorts. We used baseline data from the Berlin Aging Study II (BASE-II), obtained in 2009-2014 from 1869 participants aged 60 years and older. We identified 13 gender related variables and used them to construct a gender score (GS) by primary component and logistic regression analysis. Of these, 9 variables contributed to a gender score: chronic stress, marital status, risk taking behavior, agreeableness, neuroticism, extraversion, loneliness, conscientiousness, and education. GS differed significantly between females and males as defined by sex. Next, we calculated linear regressions to investigate associations between sex, GS, and selected biological and well-being variables. Sex, but not GS was significantly associated with LDL-C and TC. GS, but not sex, was significantly associated with cortisol levels, CES-depression, negative affect, life satisfaction. Thus, we were able to develop a GS in a retrospective manner from available study variables that characterized women and men in addition to biological sex. This approach will allow us to introduce the notion of gender retrospectively into a large number of studies.","Nauman, A.

991,"Blood pressure and cognitive function across the eighth decade: a prospective study of the Lothian Birth Cohort of 1936","Objectives We investigated the associations among blood pressure and cognitive functions across the eighth decade, while accounting for anti-hypertensive medication and lifetime stability in cognitive function. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting This study used data from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (LBC1936) study, which recruited participants living in the Lothian region of Scotland when aged 70 years, most of whom had completed an intelligence test at age 11 years. Participants 1091 members of the LBC1936 with assessments of cognitive ability in childhood and older adulthood, and blood pressure measurements in older adulthood. Primary and secondary outcome measures Participants were followed up at ages 70, 73, 76, and 79, and latent growth curve models and linear mixed models were used to analyse both cognitive functions and blood pressure as primary outcomes. Results Blood pressure followed a quadratic trajectory in the eighth decade: on average blood pressure rose in the first waves and subsequently fell. Intercepts and trajectories were not associated between blood pressure and cognitive functions. Women with higher early-life cognitive function generally had lower blood pressure during the eighth decade. Being prescribed anti-hypertensive medication was associated with lower blood pressure, but not with better cognitive function. Conclusions Our findings indicate an association between early-life cognitive function and later-life blood pressure, specifically among women. However, we did not find support for the hypothesis that rises in blood pressure and worse cognitive decline are associated with one another in the eighth decade.","Altschul, D.; Starr, J.; Deary, I.",20191219,"Geriatric Medicine","10.1101/2019.12.16.19015040",1,"Drew Altschul","Mental Health Data Science Scotland, The University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK, EH8 9JZ","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.16.19015040v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.16.19015040v1.full.pdf","cc_by",NA,"Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 data can be requested from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 research team, following completion of a data request application.

999,"Biopsy-free prediction of prostate cancer aggressiveness using deep learning and radiology imaging","Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is routinely used to visualize the prostate gland and manage prostate cancer. The Prostate Imaging Reporting And Data System (PI-RADS) is used to evaluate the clinical risk associated with a potential tumor. However the PI-RADS score is subjective and its assessment varies between physicians. As a result, a definite diagnosis of prostate cancer requires a biopsy to obtain tissue for pathologic analysis. A prostate biopsy is an invasive procedure and is associated with complications, including hematospermia, hematuria, and rectal bleeding. We hypothesized that an Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be trained on prostate cases where both imaging and biopsy are available to distinguish aggressive prostate cancer from non-aggressive lesions using MRI imaging only, that is, without the need for a biopsy. Our computational method, named AI-biopsy, can distinguish aggressive prostate cancer from non-aggressive disease with an AUC of 0.855 and a 79.02% accuracy. We used Class Activation Maps (CAM) to highlight which regions of MRI images are being used by our algorithm for classification, and found that AI-biopsy generally focuses on the same regions that trained uro-radiolosts focus on, with a few exceptions. In conclusion, AI-biopsy provides a data-driven and reproducible way to assess cancer aggressiveness from MRI images and a personalized strategy to reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies.","Khosravi, P.; Lysandrou, M.; Eljalby, M.; Brendel, M.; Li, Q.; Kazemi, E.; Barnes, J.; Zisimopoulos, P.; Sigaras, A.; Ricketts, C.; Meleshko, D.; Yat, A.; Mcclure, T.

The aim of the NIHR HIC is to improve the quality and availability of routinely-collected data for collaborative, cross-centre research. This is demonstrated through research collaborations in selected therapeutic areas, one of which is viral hepatitis. Design: The collaboration in viral hepatitis identified a rich set of data points, including information on clinical assessment, antiviral treatment, laboratory test results, and health outcomes. Clinical data from different centres was standardised and combined to produce a research-ready dataset; this was used to generate insights regarding disease prevalence and treatment response. Results: A comprehensive database has been developed for potential viral hepatitis research interests, with a corresponding data dictionary for researchers across the centres. An initial cohort of 960 patients with chronic hepatitis B infections and 950 patients with chronic hepatitis C infections has been collected. Conclusion: For the first time, large prospective cohorts are being formed within NHS secondary care services that will allow research questions to be rapidly addressed using real world data. Interactions with industry partners will help to shape future research and will inform patient-stratified clinical practice. An emphasis on NHS-wide systems interoperability, and the increased utilisation of structured data solutions for electronic patient records, is improving access to data for research, service improvement and the reduction of clinical data gaps.","Smith, D.

997,"Factors associated with access to Insecticide-Treated Nets and use of house modification in Bagamoyo and Ulanga districts, Tanzania","Background: Insecticide-treated Nets (ITNs) and house modifications are proven vector control tools, yet full coverage has frequently not been achieved. This study investigates factors associated with ITN access and use of house modification in Tanzania. Methods: Baseline data from cross-sectional surveys was analysed from 7,240 households in Bagamoyo (60km north of Dar es Salaam) and 1,241 households in Ulanga (a remote rural area), from previous studies on spatial repellants and indoor residual spray evaluation. We estimated the associations between the outcomes: population access to ITNs, ITN per sleeping spaces, presence of window screens and closed eaves, and the covariates household size, age, gender, pregnancy, education, mosquito entry (doors and windows), house modification (window screens & closed eaves), mean distance to mosquito breeding sites and wealth using regression models. Result: Population access to ITNs (households with one ITN per two potential people that stayed in the house the previous night of the survey) was 64% (56 - 71) and ITNs per sleeping spaces (households with enough ITNs to cover all sleeping spaces used the previous night of the survey) was 63% (54 - 72) in Bagamoyo, three years after the last Universal Coverage Campaigns (UCC). These findings are both lower than the 80% coverage target of the Tanzania National Malaria Strategic Plan (Tanzania NMSP). In Ulanga, population access to ITNs was 84% (78 - 91) and ITNs per sleeping spaces was 93% (89 - 97), one year after the last UCC. Household size was significantly associated with lower access to ITNs even shortly after UCC. House modification was common in both areas. In Bagamoyo, screened windows were more common than closed eaves (61% vs 14%) whereas in Ulanga more houses had closed eaves than window screens (55% vs 12%). Households in the poorest quintile were less likely to adopt window screening and closing eaves in Bagamoyo, this contrasts with Ulanga district where a greater proportion of poorer households blocked eaves with mud but were less likely to adopt screening.","Odufuwa, O.

986,"Stochastic challenges to interrupting helminth transmission","Predicting the effect of different programmes designed to control both the morbidity induced by helminth infections and parasite transmission is greatly facilitated by the use of mathematical models of transmission and control impact. In such models, it is essential to account for as many sources of uncertainty -- natural, or otherwise -- to ensure robustness in prediction and to accurately depict variation around an expected outcome. In this paper, we investigate how well the standard deterministic models match the predictions made using individual-based stochastic simulations. We also explore how well concepts which derive from deterministic models, such as  breakpoints in transmission, apply in the stochastic world. Employing an individual based stochastic model framework we also investigate how transmission and control are affected by the migration of infected people into a defined community. To give our study focus we consider the control of soil-transmitted helminths (STH) by mass drug administration (MDA), though our methodology is readily applicable to the other helminth species such as the schistosome parasites and the filarial worms. We show it is possible to define a  stochastic breakpoint where much noise surrounds the expected deterministic breakpoint. We also discuss the concept of the  interruption of transmission independent of the  breakpoint concept where analyses of model behaviour illustrate the current limitations of deterministic models to account for the  fade-out or transmission extinction behaviour in simulations. The analyses based on migration confirm a relationship between the infected human migration rate per unit of time and the death rate of infective stages that are released into the free-living environment (eggs or larvae depending on the STH species) that create the reservoir of infection which in turn determines the likelihood that control activities aim at chemotherapeutic treatment of the human host will eliminate transmission. The development of a new stochastic simulation code for STH in the form of a publicly-available open-source python package which includes features to incorporate many population stratifications, different control interventions including mass drug administration (with defined frequency, coverage levels and compliance patterns) and inter-village human migration is also described.","Hardwick, R.

980,"Cortical thickness and formal thought disorder in schizophrenia: An ultra high-field network-based morphometry study","Background: Persistent formal thought disorder (FTD) is a core feature of schizophrenia. Recent cognitive and neuroimaging studies indicate a distinct mechanistic pathway underlying the persistent positive FTD (pFTD or disorganized thinking), though its structural determinants are still elusive. Using network-based cortical thickness estimates from ultra-high field 7-Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging (7T MRI), we investigated the structural correlates of pFTD. Methods: We obtained speech samples and 7T MRI anatomical scans from medicated clinically stable patients with schizophrenia (n=19) and healthy controls (n=20). Network-based morphometry was used to estimate the mean cortical thickness of 17 functional networks covering the entire cortical surface from each subject. We also quantified the vertexwise variability of thickness within each network to quantify the spatial coherence of the 17 networks, estimated patients vs. controls differences, and related the thickness of the affected networks to the severity of pFTD. Results: Patients had reduced thickness of the frontoparietal and default mode networks, and reduced spatial coherence affecting the salience and the frontoparietal control network. A higher burden of positive FTD related to reduced frontoparietal thickness and reduced spatial coherence of the salience network. The presence of positive FTD, but not its severity, related to the reduced thickness of the language network comprising of the superior temporal cortex. Conclusions: These results suggest that cortical thickness of both cognitive control and language networks underlie the positive FTD in schizophrenia. The structural integrity of cognitive control networks is a critical determinant of the expressed severity of persistent FTD in schizophrenia.","Palaniyappan, L.; Al-Radaideh, A.; Gowland, P.; Liddle, P.",20191218,"Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology","10.1101/2019.12.17.19014415",1,"Lena Palaniyappan","University of Western Ontario","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.17.19014415v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.17.19014415v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd","10.1016/j.pnpbp.2020.109911","Reasonable requests for the anonymised data reported in this manuscript can be made to the corresponding author"
981,"Quantifying and characterizing hourly human exposure to malaria vectors bites in rural southwest Burkina Faso","Background: To sustain the efficacy of malaria vector control, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the combination of effective tools. Before designing and implementing additional strategies in any setting, it is critical to monitor or predict when and where transmission occurs. However, to date, very few studies have quantified the behavioural interactions between humans and Anopheles vectors. Here, we characterized residual transmission in a rural area of Burkina Faso where long lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) are widely used. Methods: We analysed data on both human and malaria vectors behaviours from 27 villages to measure hourly human exposure to vector bites in dry and rainy seasons using mathematical models. We estimated the protective efficacy of LLINs and characterised where (indoors vs. outdoors) and when both LLIN users and non-users were exposed to vector bites. Results: The percentage of the population who declared sleeping under a LLIN the previous night was very high regardless of the season, with an average LLIN use ranging from 92.43% to 99.89%. The use of LLIN provided > 80% protection against exposure to vector bites. The proportion of exposure for LLIN users was 29-57% after 05:00 and 0.05-12 % before 20:00. More than 80% of exposure occurred indoors for LLIN users and the estimate reached 90% for children under five years old in the dry cold season. Conclusions: This study supports the current use of LLIN as a primary malaria vector control tool. It also emphasises the need to complement LLIN with indoor-implemented measures such as indoor residual spraying (IRS) and/or house improvement to effectively combat malaria in the rural area of Diebougou. Furthermore, malaria elimination programmes would also require strategies that target outdoor biting vectors to be successful in the area.

995,"Comparative Evaluation of CHROMagar COL-APSE, MicroScan Walkaway, ComASPColistin, and Colistin MAC Test in Detecting Colistin-resistant Gram-Negative Bacteria","Colistin has become a critical antibiotic for fatal Gram-negative infections owing to the proliferation of multidrug-resistant carbapenemase-producing bacteria. Thus, cheaper, faster, efficient and easier-to-use colistin diagnostics are required for clinical surveillance, diagnoses and therapeutics. The sensitivity, specificity, major error (ME), very major error (VME), categorial agreement, essential agreement, turnaround time (TAT), average cost, and required skill for four colistin resistance diagnostics viz., CHROMagar COL-APSE, ComASP Colistin, MicroScan, and Colistin MAC Test (CMT) were evaluated against broth microdilution (BMD) using 84 Gram-negative bacterial isolates. A multiplex PCR (M-PCR) was used to screen all isolates to detect the presence of the mcr-1 to mcr-5 genes. A 15-point grading scale was used to grade the tests under skill, ease, processing time etc. mcr-1 was detected by both M-PCR and CMT in a single E. coli isolate. The sensitivity and specificity of CHROMagar COL-APSE, MicroScan, and ComASP Colistin, were 82.05% and 66.67%, 92.31% and 76.92%, and 100% and 88.89% respectively. The MicroScan was the most expensive at a cost (per sampe tested) of R221.6 ($15.0), followed by CHROMagar COL-APSE (R118.3; $8.0), M-PCR (R75.1; $5.1), CMT (R20.1; $1.4) and ComASP Colistin (R2.64; $0.2). CHROMagar was the easiest to perform, followed by ComASP Colistin, M-PCR, MicroScan, CMT and BMD whilst M-PCR and MicroScan required higher skill. The ComASP Colistin was the best performing diagnostic test, with low VME and ME, making it recommendable for routine colistin sensitivity testing in clinical laboratories; particularly, in poorer settings. It is however limited by a TAT of 18-24 hours.","Sephofane, A. K.; Mbelle, N.

The impact of hypertension is on the rise in Ethiopia, so that, it is predictable that the cost of healthcare services will further increase in the future. We aimed to estimate the total cost of hypertension illness among patients attending hospitals in Southwest Shewa zone, Oromia Regional State, Ethiopia. Patients and methods: Institution based cross-sectional study was conducted from July 1-30, 2018. All hypertensive patients who were on treatment and whose age was greater than eighteen years old were eligible for this study. The total cost of hypertension illness was estimated by summing up the direct and indirect costs. Bivariate and multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with hypertension costs of illness. Results: Overall, the mean monthly total cost of hypertension illness was US $ 22.3 (95% CI, 21.3-23.3). Direct and indirect costs share 51% and 49% of the total cost, respectively. The mean total direct cost of hypertension illness per patient per month was US $11.39(95% CI, 10.6-12.1). Out of these, drugs accounted of a higher cost (31%) followed by food (25%). The mean total indirect cost per patient per month was US $10.89(95% CI, 10.4-11.4). Educational status, distance from hospital, the presence of companion and the stage of hypertension were predictors of the cost of illness of hypertension. Conclusion: The cost of hypertension illness was very high when compared with the mean monthly income of the patients letting patients to catastrophic costs. Therefore, due attention should be given by the government to protect patients from financial hardships. Key words: Illness, total cost, direct cost, indirect cost, Region, Ethiopia.","Bogale, A.

However, to date, there are no proven causal and modifiable risk factors, or effective interventions. Objective We aimed to identify: a) factors modified by prodromal Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology and b) causal risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. We identified factors modified by Alzheimer's disease using a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) on the Alzheimer's disease polygenic risk score (PRS) (p[&le;]5x10-8), stratified by age tertiles. We used two-sample bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) to estimate the causal effects of identified risk factors and correlates on liability for Alzheimer's disease. Design, setting, and participants 334,968 participants of the UK Biobank aged 39 to 72 years old (111,656 in each tertile) met our eligibility criteria. Exposures Standardized weighted PRS for Alzheimer's disease at p[&le;]5x10-8. Main outcomes and measures All available phenotypes in UK Biobank, including data on health and lifestyle, as well as samples from urine, blood and saliva, at the time of analysis. Results Genetic liability for Alzheimer's disease was associated with red blood cell indices and cognitive measures at all ages. In the middle and older age tertiles, ages 53 and above, higher genetic liability for Alzheimer's disease was adversely associated with medical history (e.g. atherosclerosis, use of cholesterol-lowering medications), physical measures (e.g. body fat measures), blood cell indices (e.g. red blood cell distribution width), cognition (e.g. fluid intelligence score) and lifestyle (e.g. self-reported moderate activity). In follow-up analyses using MR, there was only evidence that education, fluid intelligence score, hip circumference, forced vital capacity, and self-reported moderate physical activity were likely to be causal risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. Conclusion and relevance Genetic liability for Alzheimer's disease is associated with over 160 phenotypes, some as early as age 39 years. However, findings from MR analyses imply that most of these associations are likely to be a consequence of prodromal disease or selection, rather than a cause of the disease.","Korologou-Linden, R.; Anderson, E.

982,"Dose-response relationship between physical activity and mortality in adults with noncommunicable diseases: A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies","Objective To investigate the relationship between post-diagnosis physical activity and mortality in patients with selected noncommunicable diseases, including breast cancer, lung cancer, type 2 diabetes (T2D), ischemic heart disease (IHD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, osteoarthritis, low back pain and major depressive disorders. Design Systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis. Data sources PubMed, Scopus and the Web of Science were searched systematically for English publications from the inception of the platforms until August 2018. Additionally, the search was updated in August 2019. Eligibility criteria Prospective observational studies examining the relationship between at least three physical activity categories and all-cause mortality or disease-specific mortality as the primary outcome. Results In total, 28 studies were included: 12 for breast cancer, 6 for T2D, 8 for IHD and 2 for COPD. The linear meta-analysis revealed that each 10 metabolic equivalent tasks (MET) h increase of physical activity per week was associated with a 22% lower mortality rate in breast cancer patients (Hazard Ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.86), 12% in IHD patients (HR, 0.88; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.93), 30% in COPD patients (HR, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.45, 1.09) and 4% in T2D patients (HR, 0.96; 95% CI: 0.93, 0.99). The non-linear meta-analysis showed a regressive association with no threshold for the beneficial effect of physical activity on mortality. Conclusion Higher levels of post-diagnosis physical activity are associated with lower mortality rates in breast cancer, T2D, IHD and COPD patients, with evidence of a no-threshold and non-linear dose-response pattern.","Geidl, W.; Schlesinger, S.; Mino, E.; Miranda, L.; Pfeifer, K.",20191218,"Public And Global Health","10.1101/2019.12.18.19014340",1,"Wolfgang Geidl","Department of Sport Science and Sport, Division Exercise and Health, Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuernberg, Erlangen, Germany","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.18.19014340v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.18.19014340v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"Data (including the extracted contents from the searched articles) are available upon reasonable request from Dr. Wolfgang Geidl; mail: wolfgang.geidl@fau.de"
1012,"The Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials (ABC-CT): Scientific Context, Study Design, and Progress towards Biomarker Qualification","Clinical research in neurodevelopmental disorders remains reliant upon clinician and caregiver measures. Limitations of these approaches indicate a need for objective, quantitative, and reliable biomarkers to advance clinical research. Extant research suggests the potential utility of multiple candidate biomarkers; however, effective application of these markers in trials requires additional understanding of replicability, individual differences, and intra-individual stability over time. The Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials (ABC-CT) is a multi-site study designed to investigate a battery of electrophysiological (EEG) and eye-tracking (ET) indices as candidate biomarkers for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The study complements published biomarker research through: inclusion of large, deeply phenotyped cohorts of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typical development; a longitudinal design; a focus on well-evidenced candidate biomarkers harmonized with an independent sample; high levels of clinical, regulatory, technical, and statistical rigor; adoption of a governance structure incorporating diverse expertise in the ASD biomarker discovery and qualification process; prioritization of open science, including creation of a repository containing biomarker, clinical, and genetic data; and use of economical and scalable technologies that are applicable in developmental populations and those with special needs. The ABC-CT approach has yielded encouraging results, with one measure accepted into the FDA Biomarker Qualification Program to date. Through these advances, the ABC-CT and other biomarker studies in progress hold promise to deliver novel tools to improve clinical trials research in ASD.","Mcpartland, J. C.; Bernier, R.

1011,"Assessing the effectiveness of a pediatrician-led newborn parenting class on maternal newborn-care knowledge, confidence and anxiety: A nonrandomized controlled trial","Background: The postpartum hospital stay is a unique opportunity for clinicians to educate parents on the importance of promoting early child development. Pediatricians are well positioned to address both medical and developmental concerns during critical periods of development, yet very few parenting interventions are led by pediatricians. Aims: To assess the impact of a novel one-hour long pediatrician-led Newborn Class on maternal knowledge, confidence, and anxiety. Methods: We conducted a nonrandomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of the Newborn Class. First-time mothers who delivered a full-term singleton vaginally with no major complications and attended the class were recruited. Mothers who expressed a desire to attend the class but were discharged before a class was offered served as controls. Outcome measures: Maternal self-perceived anxiety and confidence were measured using standardized scales (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Adults and Karitane Parenting Confidence Scale). Knowledge on newborn care was assessed using a novel scale. Results: A total of 84 participants (intervention n=36, control n=48) were included in the study. Mothers who attended class showed significantly higher levels of knowledge compared to the control group as well as significantly higher parenting confidence levels. No change was observed in the overall level of anxiety. Conclusions: A short pediatrician-led parenting intervention can be an effective tool in improving maternal confidence and newborn care knowledge. Given the importance of the newborn period in establishing healthy developmental trajectories, this cost- and time-effective intervention could be widely implemented to promote early strong mother-infant relationships that foster healthy development.","Gozali, A.; Gibson, S.; Lipton, L.

994,"Prenatal cannabis exposure and childhood outcomes: Results from the ABCD study","Importance: In light of increasing cannabis use among pregnant women, the Surgeon General of the United States issued an advisory against the use of marijuana during pregnancy on August 29th, 2019. Objective: To determine whether cannabis use during pregnancy is associated with adverse outcomes among offspring. Design: Cross-sectional analysis of the baseline session of the ongoing longitudinal Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study. Setting: Data were collected from 22 sites across the United States between 2016 and 2018. Participants: Children ages 9-11 (n=11,489) and their parent or caregiver. Exposure: Prenatal marijuana exposure prior to and following maternal knowledge of pregnancy. Main Outcomes and Measures: Child psychopathology symptomatology (i.e., psychotic-like experiences and internalizing, externalizing, attention, thought, and social problems), cognition, sleep, birth weight, gestational age at birth, body mass index (BMI), and brain structure (i.e., total intracranial volume, white matter volume, gray matter volume). Covariates included familial (e.g., income, familial psychopathology), pregnancy (e.g., prenatal vitamin use, whether the pregnancy was planned), and child (e.g., birth weight, substance use) variables. Results: Among 11,489 children (age 9.9{+/-}0.6 years; 47.78% female), 655 (5.70%) were prenatally exposed to cannabis in total. Marijuana use prior to (n=648; 5.64%) and following (n=242; 2.11%) maternal knowledge of pregnancy were associated with increased offspring psychopathology characteristics (i.e., psychotic-like experiences and internalizing, externalizing, attention, thought, social, and sleep problems) and BMI as well as reduced cognition, birth weight, and brain structure (i.e., total white and gray mater volumes; all psfdr<.007), but not gestational age at birth. Exposure following maternal knowledge of pregnancy remained significantly associated with psychopathology, cognition, and birth weight outcomes when including potentially confounding variables (all ps<0.046). All associations with exposure prior to maternal knowledge of pregnancy were nonsignificant when considering potentially confounding variables (all ps>0.06). Conclusions and Relevance: Prenatal cannabis exposure, and its correlated factors, may increase risk for psychopathology and reduced cognition during middle childhood as well as reduced birthweight. Consistent with recent recommendations by the Surgeon General, marijuana use during pregnancy should be discouraged.","Paul, S. E.; Hatoum, A. S.; Fine, J. D.; Johnson, E. C.; Hansen, I.; Karcher, N.

1010,"Serotype patterns of pneumococcal disease in adults are correlated with carriage patterns in older children","Background: The importance of specific serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) differs by age. Data on pneumococcal carriage in different age groups, along with data on serotype-specific invasiveness, could help to explain these age-related patterns and their implications for vaccination. Methods: Using pneumococcal carriage and disease data from Israel, we evaluated the association between serotype-specific IPD in adults and serotype-specific carriage prevalence among children in different age categories, while adjusting for serotype-specific invasiveness. We used a sliding window approach to estimate carriage prevalence using different age groupings. Deviance Information Criterion was used to determine which age groupings of carriage data best fit the adult IPD data. Serotype-specific disease patterns were further evaluated by stratifying IPD data by comorbidity status. Results: The relative frequency of serotypes causing IPD differed between adults and children, and also differed between older and younger adults and between adults with and without comorbidities. Serotypes over-represented as causes of IPD in adults were more commonly carried in older children as compared to younger children. In line with this, the serotype-specific frequency of carriage in older children (aged 36-59 months), rather than infants, best correlated with serotype-specific IPD in adults. Conclusions: These analyses suggest that older children, rather than infants, are the main drivers of disease patterns in adults. These insights could help in optimizing vaccination strategies to reduce disease burden across all ages.","Wyllie, A. L.; Warren, J. L.; Regev-Yochay, G.; Givon-Lavi, N.; Dagan, R.; Weinberger, D.

Cross-section study.","Abstract Background: Mental disorders are one of the public health issues throughout the worldwide. Among people with mental disorders, more than 21 million people have schizophrenia. However, there is scarcity of information about perception and attitude of the community toward people with schizophrenia in Ethiopia including the study area. Objective: To assess the community perception and attitude towards people with schizophrenia among residents of Arba Minch Zuria District, Arba Minch Health and Demographic Surveillance System sites (AM-HDSS), Southern Ethiopia Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 617 randomly selected residents of Arba Minch Zuria District, AM-HDSS Site. The data was collected using structured, pre-tested and interviewer-administered questionnaires. Descriptive statistics including frequencies, means, and median were performed. Binary and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors affecting community attitude. Results: The finding of this study showed that, among study participants 469(76%) have a good perception towards people with schizophrenia and 390(63.2%) of respondents have positive attitudes towards people living with schizophrenia. Talkativeness and self-neglect behaviors were the most commonly mentioned manifestation of schizophrenia. Substance misuse and head injury were the most perceived cause of schizophrenia. Spiritual/traditional methods were preferred place for the treatment of schizophrenia. Age of respondents, sex of respondent; educational status and perception toward people with schizophrenia were significantly associated with positive attitude towards people with schizophrenia. Conclusions: Among our rural adults nearly half of the study participants have a negative attitude towards people with schizophrenia. Therefore, giving special attention to females, youths, uneducated and individuals who have poor perception toward people living with schizophrenia is crucial. Also, future mental health promotion activities should focus on cause and common manifestation of schizophrenia to improve the community attitude toward people with schizophrenia.","Boti, N.; Hussen, S.; Ayele, G.; Mersha, A.; Gebeyehu, S.; Kassa, M.; Feleke, T.; Temesgen, G.",20191219,"Public And Global Health","10.1101/2019.12.18.19015271",1,"Negussie Boti Sr.","Arba Minch University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.18.19015271v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.18.19015271v1.full.pdf","cc0_ng",NA,"Availability of data and materials

1018,"An integrated deep mutational scanning approach provides clinical insights on PTEN genotype-phenotype relationships","Germline variation in PTEN results in variable clinical presentations, including benign and malignant neoplasia and neurodevelopmental disorders. Despite decades of research, it remains unclear how PTEN genotype is related to clinical outcomes. In this study, we combined two recent deep mutational scanning (DMS) datasets probing the effects of single-amino acid variation on enzyme activity and steady-state cellular abundance with the largest well-curated clinical cohort of PTEN-variant carriers. We sought to connect variant-specific molecular phenotypes to the clinical outcomes of individuals with PTEN variants. We found that DMS data partially explain quantitative clinical traits, including head circumference and Cleveland Clinic (CC) score, which is a semi-quantitative surrogate of disease burden. We built a logistic regression model using DMS and CADD scores to separate clinical PTEN variation from gnomAD control-only variation with high accuracy (AUC = 0.892). Using a survival-like analysis, we identified molecular phenotype groups with differential risk of early-onset as well as lifetime risk of cancer. Finally, we identified classes of DMS-defined variants with significantly different risk levels for classical hamartoma-related features (odds ratios range of 4.1-102.9). In stark contrast, the risk for developing autism or developmental delay does not significantly change across variant classes (odds ratios range of 5.4-12.4). Together, these findings highlight the potential impact of combining DMS datasets with rich clinical data, and provide new insights that may guide personalized clinical decisions for PTEN-variant carriers.","Mighell, T.

1005,"Influence of socioeconomic factors on cancer incidence and stage of melanoma in China","Background: Although a high socioeconomic status (SES) was considered as an established risk factor for melanoma in western countries and areas, there was limited evidence of the association between SES and melanoma in China. Methods: We studied prospectively enrolled primary melanoma patients at Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University over a period of 5 years between January 2013 to December 2017. The clinical stage at diagnosis was categorized according to Guidelines of Chinese Society Oncology, Melanoma. SES data were estimated using data from Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of the People's Republic of China and National Healthcare Security Administration. Results: Of 122 patients with pathologic melanoma diagnosed enrolled in this study. 58 (48%) were male and 64 (52%) were female, the mean age was 59.23{+/-}9.91 years and median age was 60.5 years. Patients in 45-59 age group and 60-73 age group tend to have higher cancer incidence compared with other age groups. The acral lentiginous melanoma (48%) was the most common subtype. Patients with low education level (middle school and below) and low monthly household income (<3000CNY) were associated with a greater risk of melanoma. Similar results were indicated for the patients who were unemployed. There were remarkable more patients who had medical insurance diagnosed with melanoma in this study. There was no significant difference on melanoma stage for patients with higher compared to lower education level (p=0.153). For monthly household income, the Fish's exact test indicated no significant difference in melanoma stage with p=0.507. No staging difference was observed between unemployed patients and employed patients (p=0.687). Finally, statistically significant differences in melanoma staging were not indicated by a patient's insurance status (p=0.537). Conclusions: For patients enrolled in our study, disadvantaged SES did not substantially lead to an increasing risk of melanoma incidence, and the effect of socioeconomic factors seemed uninfluenced the stage of melanoma.","Liu, J.",20191221,"Oncology","10.1101/2019.12.19.19013706",1,"Jiaqi Liu","Zhongshan hospital, Fudan University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19013706v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19013706v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"All data, models, and code generated or used during the study appear in the submitted article."
1024,"Impact of a pilot community pharmacy system redesign on reducing over-the-counter medication misuse in older adults","Objectives: This pilot study examines effectiveness of an innovative pharmacy design change on over-the-counter (OTC) medication misuse in older adults (ages over 64). Few interventions have attempted to decrease older adult OTC misuse, and none have addressed system barriers. A structural redesign of the pharmacy (the Senior Section) was conceptualized to increase awareness of higher-risk OTC medications. The Senior Section contains a curated selection of OTC medications (for pain, cough/cold, allergy, sleep) and is close to the prescription department to facilitate pharmacy staff/patient engagement to reduce misuse. Methods: A pre-/post-implementation design was used to recruit 87 older adults from three pharmacies. Using a hypothetical scenario, participants selected an OTC medication, which was compared to their medication list and health conditions, and their reported use was compared against the product labeling. Four misuse outcomes were determined: (1) Drug/Drug, (2) Drug/Disease, (3) Drug/Age, and (4) Drug/Label with five sub-types. Patient characteristics were collected and compiled into a propensity-score matching logistic regression model to estimate their effects on the Senior Section's association with misuse outcomes at pre-/post-implementation. Results: Patient characteristic were uniform between pre-/post-implementation and, once entered into a propensity-score matching model, Drug/Disease Misuse significantly lessened over time (z=-2.09, p=0.037). The Senior Section reduced Drug/Drug Misuse, but not significantly. Drug/Label Misuse varied according to the sub-type, with reduced Daily-Dosage (z=-2.42, p=0.016) and Single-Dosage misuse (z=-5.82, p=0.001); however, Timing/Frequency misuse increased (z=2.16, p=0.031). Conclusions: These nascent outcomes support a well-conceived pharmacy-based OTC aisles redesign as valuable for reducing older adult OTC medication misuse. The Senior Section, when broadly implemented, would create new permanent structures and processes to assist older adults in accessing risk information for confidently selecting safer OTC medications.","Gilson, A.; Stone, J.; Morris, A.; Brown, R.; Xiong, K.; Jacobson, N.; Holden, R.; Albert, S.; Phelan, C.; Walbrandt Pigarelli, D.; Breslow, R.; Welch, L.; Chui, M.

Methods: MRI measurements of 29 intracranial structures were obtained for 389 adults with NF1 and 112 age- and sex-matched unaffected control subjects. A subset of NF1 patients (n = 70) was also assessed for clinical severity of NF1 features and neurological problems and received psychometric testing for attention deficiencies and IQ. Brain morphological measurements were compared between NF1 and control subjects, and correlation analyses were performed between principal components of the intracranial measurements and clinical and psychometric features. Results: Four of nine corpus callosum measurements were significantly greater in adults with NF1 than in sex- and age-matched controls. All seven brainstem measurements were significantly greater in adults with NF1 than in controls. No robust correlations were observed between the size of these structures and clinical or neuropsychometric assessments. Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that dysregulation of brain myelin production is an important manifestation of NF1 in adults.","Wang, S.; Mautner, V.-F.; Friedman, J.

1009,"Socioeconomic inequalities in blood pressure: co-ordinated analysis of 147,775 participants from repeated birth cohort and cross-sectional datasets, 1989 to 2016","Objective: To evaluate whether socioeconomic inequalities in blood pressure (BP) have changed from 1989 to 2016 - a period in which average BP levels declined and the detection and treatment of high BP increased. Design Repeated observational studies. Setting: 3 nationally representative British birth cohort studies - born in 1946, 1958, and 1970 - and 21 nationally representative cross-sectional studies (Health Survey for England 1994 to 2016, HSE). Participants: 147,775 participants with BP outcomes at age 42-46 years (cohorts) or 25 years and over (HSE). Main outcome measure: Absolute differences in systolic BP (SBP) by educational attainment (cohorts and HSE) and early life social class (cohorts). Results: In both datasets, lower education was associated with higher SBP, with similar absolute magnitudes of inequality across the studied period. Differences in SBP by education (Slope Index of Inequality) based on HSE data were 3.0mmHg (95% CI: 1.8, 4.2) in 1994 and 4.3mmHg (2.3, 6.3) in 2016. Findings were similar for diastolic BP (DBP) and survey-defined hypertension. Cohort data suggested that disadvantage in early and adult life had cumulative independent associations with BP: cohort-pooled differences in SBP were 4.9mmHg (3.7, 6.1) in a score combining early life social class and own education, yet were 3.4mmHg (2.4, 4.4) for education alone. In both datasets, inequalities were found across the SBP distribution - below and above hypertension thresholds - yet were larger at the upper tail; in HSE, median SBP differences were 2.8mmHg (1.7, 3.9) yet 5.6mmHg (4.9, 6.4) at the 90th quantile. Conclusion: Socioeconomic inequalities in BP have persisted from 1989 to 2016, despite improved detection and treatment of high BP. To achieve future reductions in BP inequalities, policies addressing the wider structural determinants of high BP levels are likely required - targeting detection and treatment alone is unlikely to be sufficient.","Bann, D.; Fluharty, M.; Hardy, R.; Scholes, S.",20191221,"Epidemiology","10.1101/2019.12.19.19015313",1,"David Bann","Centre for Longitudinal Studies, Department of Social Science, University College London, London, UK","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19015313v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19015313v1.full.pdf","cc_by",NA,"1946c data are available from: https://www.nshd.mrc.ac.uk/data/data-sharing/ 1946c, 1958c, 1970c and HSE data are available from the UK Data Archive: https://www.data-archive.ac.uk."
1020,"Estimation of Quasi-Continuous Blood Pressure based on Harmonic Phase-Shifts in Signals using Non-Invasive Photoplethysmographic Measurements","According to the guidelines of the European Society of Hypertension International Protocol revision 2010, the requirements for long time blood pressure measurement (BPM) are: simple handling, robustness against movements, accuracy of better than 5 mmHg, and, above all, that the patient's motion should not be restricted during measurement. These requirements are in particular important for a reliable interpretation of the blood pressure (BP) of hypertensive patients, because such a diagnosis will usually be confirmed by long-term measurement. Moreover, to be able to correlate the patient's BP with his normal daily activity, non-obstructive non-invasive methods are desired to reduce the patient's load. The main concern of this paper is to present a novel method for estimating non-invasive continuous blood pressure (CBP) from a single photoplethysmography (PPG) signal. In contrast to the pulse transit time (PTT) method, our approach is based on the assumption that the phase-velocities of the fundamental and higher harmonics depend on the (non-linear) elastic properties of the arteries. Consequently, phase velocity varies as a function of a vessel's instantaneous dilation and can be effectively utilised for CBP estimation. In addition to its numerous advantages for a simplified measurement setup, we could show that the method achieves a high degree of correlation for a reliable BP estimation from PPG data. Comparison with state-of-the-art PTT methods was carried out using a dataset from the PhysioBank Database comprising a reference invasive blood pressure (IBP) signal measured at the radial artery, a PPG signal measured at the fingertip and a standard ECG signal. The correlation values obtained from the long-time estimation of the systolic blood pressure (SBP) were as high as r = 0.8945, while the value for the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was found to be r = 0.9082 and the correlation of the mean blood pressure (MBP) was r = 0.9322. These results were achieved by analysing the dataset in a beat-to-beat manner and regarding several post-processing procedures like coherent averaging (CA) and zero padding with quasi-continuous frequency domain estimation and artificially refined frequency resolution.","Kern, F.; Bernhard, S.",20191221,"Health Informatics","10.1101/2019.12.19.19015321",1,"Stefan Bernhard","Technische Hochschule Mittelhessen","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19015321v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.19015321v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc",NA,"All data is available free on UCI Machine Learning Repository of the University of California, Irvine, which is part of the <U+0094>PhysioNet<U+0094> data base"
1017,"The effects of polygenic risk for psychiatric disorders and smoking behaviour on psychotic experiences in UK Biobank","While psychotic experiences are core symptoms of mental health disorders like schizophrenia, they are also reported by 5-10% of the population. Both smoking behaviour and genetic risk for psychiatric disorders have been associated with psychotic experiences, but the interplay between these factors remains poorly understood. We tested whether smoking status, maternal smoking around birth, and number of packs smoked/year were associated with lifetime occurrence of three psychotic experiences phenotypes: delusions (n=2067), hallucinations (n=6689), and any psychotic experience (delusions or hallucinations; n=7803) in 144818 UK Biobank participants. We next calculated polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia (PRSSCZ), major depression (PRSDEP) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (PRSADHD) in the UK Biobank participants to assess whether association between smoking and psychotic experiences was attenuated after adjustment of diagnosis of psychiatric disorders and the PRSs. Finally, we investigated whether smoking exacerbates the effects of genetic predisposition on the psychotic phenotypes in gene-environment interaction models. Smoking status, maternal smoking, and number of packs smoked/year were significantly associated with psychotic experiences (p<1.77x10-5). Except for packs smoked/year, effects were attenuated but remained significant after adjustment for diagnosis of psychiatric disorders and PRSs (p<1.99x10-3). Gene-environment interaction models showed the effects of PRSDEP and PRSADHD (but not PRSSCZ) on delusions (but not hallucinations) were significantly greater in current smokers compared to never smokers (p<0.0028). There were no significant gene-environment interactions for maternal smoking nor for number of packs smoked/year. Our results suggest that both genetic risk of psychiatric disorders and smoking status may have independent and synergistic effects on specific types of psychotic experiences.","Garcia-Gonzalez, J.; Ramirez, J.; Howard, D.

1022,"An integrative machine learning approach to discovering multi-level molecular mechanisms of obesity using data from monozygotic twin pairs","We combined clinical, cytokine, genomic, methylation and dietary data from 43 young adult monozygotic twin pairs (aged 22 - 36, 53% female), where 25 of the twin pairs were substantially weight discordant (delta BMI > 3kg/ m2). These measurements were originally taken as part of the TwinFat study, a substudy of The Finnish Twin Cohort study. These five large multivariate data sets (comprising 42, 71, 1587, 1605 and 63 variables, respectively) were jointly analysed using an integrative machine learning method called Group Factor Analysis (GFA) to offer new hypotheses into the multi-molecular-level interactions associated with the development of obesity. New potential links between cytokines and weight gain are identified, as well as associations between dietary, inflammatory and epigenetic factors. This encouraging case study aims to enthuse the research community to boldly attempt new machine learning approaches which have the potential to yield novel and unintuitive hypotheses.

1023,"Immunologic and epidemiologic drivers of norovirus transmission in daycare and school outbreaks","Background: Norovirus outbreaks are notoriously explosive, with dramatic symptomology and rapid disease spread. Children are particularly vulnerable to infection and drive norovirus transmission due to their high contact rates with each other and the environment. Despite the explosive nature of norovirus outbreaks, attack rates in schools and daycares remain low with the majority of students not reporting symptoms. Methods: We explore immunologic and epidemiologic mechanisms that may underlie epidemic norovirus transmission dynamics using a disease transmission model. Towards this end, we compared different model scenarios, including innate resistance and acquired immunity (collectively denoted 'immunity'), stochastic extinction, and an individual exclusion intervention. We calibrated our model to daycare and school outbreaks from national surveillance data. Results: Recreating the low attack rates observed in daycare and school outbreaks required a model with immunity. However, immunity alone resulted in shorter duration outbreaks than what was observed. The addition of individual exclusion (to the immunity model) extended outbreak durations by reducing the amount of time that symptomatic people contribute to transmission. Including both immunity and individual exclusion mechanisms resulted in simulations where both attack rates and outbreak durations were consistent with surveillance data. Conclusions: The epidemiology of norovirus outbreaks in daycare and school settings cannot be well described by a simple transmission model in which all individuals start as fully susceptible. Interventions should leverage population immunity and encourage more rigorous individual exclusion to improve venue-level control measures.","Havumaki, J.; Eisenberg, J. N.; Mattison, C.

1021,"Seroprevalence of the hepatitis E virus among blood donors in the Qassim Region, Saudi Arabia","The aim of this study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of hepatitis E virus (HEV), a major public health issue worldwide with the potential for transmission via blood transfusion, in blood donors in the Qassim Region, Saudi Arabia. Serum samples (n = 1,078) were collected from volunteer blood donors from January to April 2019 and tested for the presence of anti-HEV IgG and IgM by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Overall, the seroprevalence of anti-HEV IgG and IgM among blood donors was 5.7% and 1.3%, respectively. Additionally, the seropositive rates of anti-HEV IgG and IgM were significantly higher in non-Saudi donors (22.1% and 7.8%) than in Saudi donors (3% and 0.2%). The seroprevalence of anti-HEV IgG increased with age; however, there was no correlation between gender and anti-HEV IgG and/or IgM. The seroprevalence of HEV among blood donors in the Qassim Region was lower than previous estimates for other regions of the country. Further studies covering a wider geographical area are needed to validate and expand the findings and to determine the importance of HEV screening in the region.","Alhatlani, B. Y.; Aljabr, W.

1015,"A public health approach to cervical cancer screening in Africa through community-based self-administered HPV testing and mobile treatment provision","Background: Sub-Saharan Africa bears the world's highest incidence of cervical cancer. To address the lack of widespread screening and treatment that contributes to this burden, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that low-resource countries adopt simplified protocols for screening directly coupled with treatment. The WHO recommendations present an opportunity -- akin to what has been done for HIV care in Africa -- for a true public health approach to cervical cancer control in resource-poor settings. We evaluated the feasibility of such a public health approach to cervical cancer that features community-based self-administered HPV screening and mobile treatment provision. Methods: In two rural districts of western Uganda, we first trained Village Health Team members (VHTs, also known as Community Health Workers) in a one-day session in the fundamental aspects of cervical cancer and its prevention. We then provided guidance to the VHTs to mobilize adult women from different communities within the district to attend a one-day HPV screening fair at a central location in their respective community. On the day of the fair, the study team and VHTs provided educational talks and instructions for self-collection of a vaginal sample. The samples were subsequently tested for high risk HPV (hrHPV) E6/E7 mRNA using the APTIMA(R) platform. Women who tested positive for hrHPV were re-contacted and referred for treatment with cryotherapy at a mobile treatment unit in their community. Visual assessment with acetic acid was used to guide suitability for cryotherapy in the mobile treatment unit versus further referral to a larger facility for a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). Results: Between March and November 2016, 2,142 women attended a health fair in one of 24 communities in rural Western Uganda and expressed interest in being screened for cervical cancer; 1902 were eligible for cervical cancer screening of which 1,892 (99.5%) provided a self-collected vaginal sample. The median age of those screened was 34 years (IQR: 28-40), HIV prevalence was 11%, and most (95%) had not been previously screened. Almost all women stated that they would perform the self-collection again and recommend it to a friend. Prevalence of any hrHPV mRNA was 21% (HPV-16, 6%; HPV-18/45, 1.9%). Among the 393 women with detectable hrHPV mRNA, 89% had their results transmitted to them, of whom 86% returned to the mobile treatment unit. At the mobile treatment, 85% of women underwent ablative therapy, with the remainder deferred either because of pregnancy (9.0%), need for LEEP (2.6%) or other reasons (3.3%). Conclusion: A public health approach to cervical cancer screening, featuring community-based self-administered HPV testing and mobile treatment, was feasible and readily accepted by community women. The process is termed a ""public health approach"" because -- as is the case for HIV care in the region -- it explicitly concedes perfection at the individual level in deference to reaching a larger fraction of the population. The findings support further optimization and evaluation of this approach as a means of scaling up cervical cancer control in low resource settings. If resources for cancer control remain limited in sub-Saharan Africa, this public approach may offer one of the most efficient solutions for stemming the incessant tide of cervical cancer in the region.","Nakalembe, M.; Makanga, P.; Kambugu, A.; Laker-Oketta, M.; Huchko, M.; Martin, J.

1013,"Forecasting Cycles of Seizure Likelihood","Objective: Seizure unpredictability is rated as one of the most challenging aspects of living with epilepsy. Seizure likelihood can be influenced by a range of environmental and physiological factors that are difficult to measure and quantify. However, some generalizable patterns have been demonstrated in seizure onset. A majority of people with epilepsy exhibit circadian rhythms in their seizure times and many also show slower, multiday patterns. Seizure cycles can be measured using a range of recording modalities, including self-reported electronic seizure diaries. This study aimed to develop personalized forecasts from a mobile seizure diary app. Methods: Forecasts based on circadian and multiday seizure cycles were tested pseudo-prospectively using data from 33 app users (mean of 103 seizures per subject). Individual's strongest cycles were estimated from their reported seizure times and used to derive the likelihood of future seizures. The forecasting approach was validated using self-reported events and electrographic seizures from the Neurovista dataset, an existing database of long-term electroencephalography that has been widely used to develop forecasting algorithms. Results: The validation dataset showed that forecasts of seizure likelihood based on self-reported cycles were predictive of electrographic seizures. Forecasts using only mobile app diaries allowed users to spend an average of 62.8% of their time in a low-risk state, with 16.6% of their time in a high-risk warning state. On average, 64.5% of seizures occurred during high-risk states and less than 10% of seizures occurred in low-risk states. Significance: Seizure diary apps can provide personalized forecasts of seizure likelihood that are accurate and clinically relevant for electrographic seizures. These results have immediate potential for translation to a prospective seizure forecasting trial using a mobile diary app. It is our hope that seizure forecasting apps will one day give people with epilepsy greater confidence in managing their daily activities.","Karoly, P.

1027,"The association of neurofibromatosis and autism symptomatology is confounded by behavioral problems","Aim: to evaluate if autism symptoms and diagnoses are raised in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), to which levels, and to determine if co-occurring symptomatology accounts for this elevation. Method: We interrogated our hospital electronic medical records. We collected parental reports of autism symptomatology, adaptive behavior, and co-occurring behavioral and emotional problems on a subsample of 45 children (9 years 2 months, 49% male). Age- and sex-matched controls with (N=180) or without ASD (N=180) were drawn from the Simons Simplex Collection and compared cross-sectionally to participants with NF1. Results Diagnoses of ADHD (8.8%), not of ASD (2.1%), were raised among 968 children with NF1 identified through electronic search. Mean Social Responsiveness Score (55.9) was below the cut-off of 60 for significant autism symptoms. Participants with NF1 had significantly more autism and behavioral symptoms than typically developing (TD) controls, and significantly less than controls with autism, with one exception: ADHD symptom levels were similar to those of autistic controls. When emotional, ADHD, and communication scores were covaried, the difference between participants with NF1 and TD controls disappeared almost entirely. Interpretation: Our results do not support an association between NF1 and autism, both at the symptom and disorder levels.","Morotti, H.; Mastel, S.; Keller, K.; Barnard, R. A.; Hall, T.; O'roak, B.

1034,"Pilot assessment of low NK cell-mediated ADCC and FCGR3A genetics in myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS): Based on inclusion of family members without ME/CFS as controls, low ADCC is unsuitable as a diagnostic biomarker","ADCC (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity) is dependent on the varying capacity of NK cells to kill, the affinities of FCGR3A-encoded CD16A receptors for antibody, and the presence of antigen-specific antibodies. In vivo ADCC depends on the number of CD16A receptor-positive NK cells in blood. We hypothesized that low ADCC cell function or low effector cell numbers could be biomarkers or risk factors for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). We measured NK cell ADCC lytic capacity and antibody recognition, CD16Apositive NK cells/ul blood, and FCGR3A homozygosity for the F allele that encodes low affinity CD16A antibody receptors. ME/CFS patients met the Fukuda 1994 diagnostic criteria. In this pilot report, we examined 5 families, each with 2 to 5 ME/CFS patients, and compared 11 patients, 22 family members without ME/CFS, and 16 unrelated healthy controls. ADCC was measured as CX1:1 cytotoxic capacity (the percentage of 51Cr-Daudi tumors with obinutuzumab anti-CD20 antibody that were killed at a 1:1 ratio of CD16Apos NKs to Daudis) and CX-slope. Individual CX1:1 capacities varied from 16.2% to 81.8% and were comparable between patients and unaffected family members, while the ADCC of both family groups was lower than the unrelated healthy controls. The lack of difference between patients and their unaffected family members indicates that low ADCC is unsuitable as a diagnostic biomarker for ME/CFS. Familial CD16Apos NK blood cell counts were lower than unrelated healthy controls. The potential for synergistic effects of combined low CX1:1 and low effector cell counts occurring in the same individual was 24-fold greater for CFS family members than for unrelated controls. FCGR3A of the families was predominantly F/F homozygous, correlating with the observed low EC50 for NK recognition of target cell-bound antibody. In summary, low ADCC is unsuitable as a biomarker, but could be a familial risk factor, for ME/CFS.","Sung, A. P.; Tang, J. J.-J.; Guglielmo, M. J.; Smith-Gagen, J.; Bateman, L.; Redelman, D.

1016,"Cannabidivarin for the treatment of HIV-associated neuropathic pain: a randomized, blinded, controlled clinical trial","Background: HIV remains a major burden to the health care system and neuropathic pain is the most common neurological complication of HIV-infection. Since current treatment strategies often lack satisfying pain relief, cannabinoids are discussed as a new option. We investigated Cannabidivarin as treatment for HIV-associated neuropathic pain. Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. Patients underwent two successive treatment phases (4 weeks each) and were treated with Cannabidivarin (400mg/d) or placebo in a randomized order. A 3-week wash-out phase was designed to eliminate potential carry-overeffects and patients were followed up for 3 weeks after the end of the second treatment phase. The primary endpoint was pain intensity on an 11-point numeric rating scale and was recorded in a diary. Secondary endpoints were additional pain medication, pain characteristics and quality of life. Results: We included 32 (31 male) patients. The mean pain intensity under Cannabidivarin was by 0.62 points higher compared to placebo (p=0.16; 95% CI -0.27 to 1.51). Cannabidivarin did not influence the amount of additional pain medication, pain characteristics or quality of life. No suspected unexpected adverse reactions occurred during the trial. Discussion: Cannabidivarin was safe but failed to reduce neuropathic pain intensity in HIV-patients. This may be explained by a lack of cannabinoid receptor activation, as indicated by preclinical experiments. Further studies on larger sample sizes are needed.","Eibach, L.; Scheffel, S.; Cardebring, M.; Lettau, M.; Celik, O.; Morguet, A.; Roehle, R.; Stein, C.",20191221,"Pain Medicine","10.1101/2019.12.20.19015495",1,"Christoph Stein","Charite Universitaetsmedizin Berlin","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.20.19015495v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.20.19015495v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"Raw data are available at the Koordinationszentrum fr Klinische Studien, Charit Universittsmedizin Berlin, Germany"
1036,"Use of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in applied health research: review and recommendations","BACKGROUND: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are an increasingly popular approach for identifying confounding variables that require adjustment when estimating causal effects. This review examined the use of DAGs in applied health research to inform recommendations for improving their transparency and utility in future research. METHODS: Original health research articles published during 1999-2017 mentioning ""directed acyclic graphs"" or similar or citing DAGitty were identified from Scopus, Web of Science, Medline, and Embase. Data were extracted on the reporting of: estimands, DAGs, and adjustment sets, alongside the characteristics of each article's largest DAG. RESULTS: A total of 234 articles were identified that reported using DAGs. A fifth (n=48, 21%) reported their target estimand(s) and half (n=115, 48%) reported the adjustment set(s) implied by their DAG(s). Two-thirds of the articles (n=144, 62%) made at least one DAG available. Diagrams varied in size but averaged 12 nodes (IQR: 9-16, range: 3-28) and 29 arcs (IQR: 19-42, range: 3-99). The median saturation (i.e. percentage of total possible arcs) was 46% (IQR: 31-67, range: 12-100). 37% (n=53) of the DAGs included unobserved variables, 17% (n=25) included super-nodes (i.e. nodes containing more than one variable, and a 34% (n=49) were arranged so the constituent arcs flowed in a consistent direction. CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial variation in the use and reporting of DAGs in applied health research. Although this partly reflects their flexibility, it also highlight some potential areas for improvement. This review hence offers several recommendations to improve the reporting and use of DAGs in future research.","Tennant, P. W.; Harrison, W. J.; Murray, E. J.; Arnold, K. F.; Berrie, L.; Fox, M.

1029,"Bone changes assessed with High-Resolution peripheral Quantitative Computed Tomography (HR-pQCT) in early inflammatory arthritis: a 12-month cohort study","Objectives: We sought to determine the sensitivity of high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) to detect change and identify erosions in comparison with conventional radiography (CR) in early inflammatory arthritis patients. We also explored which prognostic factors contribute to bone damage assessed by HR-pQCT in the first year of diagnosis. Methods: 46 patients with arthritic symptoms less than one year, and a clinical diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis were prospectively imaged at baseline and 12-months. HR-pQCT scans of the 2nd and 3rd MCP joints and CR of the hands and feet were performed. Joint space width (JSW), total bone mineral density (Tt.BMD), erosion presence and volume were assessed with HR-pQCT. Scan-rescan precision was assessed to define an individual-level least significant change (LSC) criterion. Regression analyses explored prognostic factors for bone damage progression. Results: We observed no significant group-level changes in JSW, Tt.BMD or erosion volume. 20% or fewer joints demonstrated individual-level changes greater than the LSC criterion for mean JSW, Tt.BMD and erosion volume. HR-pQCT detected more erosions than CR in the 2nd and 3rd MCP. Increased symptom duration at diagnosis was associated (p < 0.10) with lower JSW minimum and higher JSW standard deviation. Conclusions: We have demonstrated stability in erosion, bone density and JSW over 12-months in most patients receiving treatment for inflammatory arthritis using a LSC criterion, although patients with longer symptom duration prior to treatment initiation had demonstrable negative effects on JSW estimates. HR-pQCT captures bone damage and progression undetectable by CR in the imaged joints.","Brunet, S. C.; Finzel, S.; Engelke, K.; Boyd, S. K.; Barnabe, C.; Manske, S.

1030,"Metagenomic Study Revealed the Potential Role of the Gut Microbiome in Gout","Emerging evidence has indicated an association between the gut microbiome and arthritis diseases including gout. This metagenomic study aims to investigate the possible role of gut microbiota in the development of gout. The results exhibit gout patients have higher abundance of Prevotella, Fusobacterium spp. and Bacteroides spp., whereas healthy controls have higher abundance of Enterobacteriaceae spp., butyrate-producing species, including Roseburia spp., Butyrivibrio spp. and Coprococcus spp. and anti-inflammatory Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Functional analysis shows gut microbiome of gout patients have higher potential for fructose, mannose metabolism and lipid A biosynthesis, but lower potential for urate degradation and SCFAs production. Enterobacteriaceae spp. may contribute to urate degradation and provide immunostimulatory effect in healthy controls. A disease classifier based on gut microbiota shows positive performance in the discovery and validation cohorts (93.03% and 89.13% accuracy, respectively). The effect of uric-acid-lowering and anti-inflammatory drugs on the gut microbiome is mild. Integrative analyses of four additional diseases (obesity, type 2 diabetes, ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis) indicates gout seems to be more similar to autoimmune diseases than metabolic diseases. This work demonstrates an altered gut microbiota might influence the development of gout and provides new insights into the diagnosis and treatment of the disease.","Yongliang, C.; Yufen, H.; Qingchun, H.; Xuefeng, X.; Peng, W.; Junxia, L.; Lifeng, L.; Xiaohong, H.; Yiqi, J.; Maojie, W.; Jianhua, Y.; Xiumin, C.; Chu, Z.; Yue, Z.; Fen, D.; Yi, Z.; Xiaodong, W.; Xueyuan, B.; Jiaqi, W.; Xia, W.; Xianghong, C.; Fang, X.; Zhang, W.; Qiang, G.; Silong, S.; Runyue, H.",20191227,"Rheumatology","10.1101/2019.12.21.19014142",1,"Huang Runyue","The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine (Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine), Guangzhou 510120 or 51006, China","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.21.19014142v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.21.19014142v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"The metagenomic shotgun sequencing data for all samples have been deposited in the CNGB Nucleotide Sequence Archive (CNSA) under accession code CNP0000284.

1033,"Host biomarkers to predict the severity of acute febrile illness: A scoping review","Background: Acute febrile illness (AFI) ranges from mild to mortal, yet severity is difficult to assess. Host biomarkers may identify patients with AFI who require a higher level of care; choosing appropriate biomarkers for this role among an expanding pool of candidates is challenging. We performed a scoping review to evaluate the performance of novel host biomarkers to predict AFI severity. Methods: PubMed was systematically searched for manuscripts published January 1, 2013 to February 10, 2018 for studies reporting the association of host biomarker levels and a measure of disease severity among patients with a suspected or diagnosed cause of AFI. Identified abstracts and full text manuscripts were reviewed for eligibility by 2 reviewers. Biomarker performance was evaluated primarily by the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic to distinguish severe disease. We aggregated data describing biomarker performance by AUC using weighted mean, fixed effects meta-analyses, and random effects meta-analyses. Results: Among 2,303 manuscripts identified, 281 manuscripts met criteria for analysis. Data was extracted for 278 biomarkers evaluated in 45,737 participants. Among 89 biomarkers evaluated by [&ge;]2 studies, there were 6 biomarkers (proadrenomedullin, copeptin, pro-atrial natriuretic peptide, serum triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1, chitinase-3-like protein-1, and the pediatric sepsis biomarker risk model), that showed a weighted mean AUC >0.75 (range 0.75-0.84) in >500 patients over >2 studies. Conclusions: Although several biomarkers show promise in predicting AFI severity across multiple studies, their test characteristics do not suggest that they may be used alone to determine AFI prognosis.","Robinson, M.

1032,"Genetic-Ancestry Analysis on >93,000 Individuals Undergoing Expanded Carrier Screening Reveals Limitations of Ethnicity-Based Medical Guidelines","Purpose: Despite strong association between genetic ancestry and carrier status, current carrier-screening guidelines recommend testing for a limited set of conditions based on patient self-reported ethnicity, which conflates genetic and cultural factors. Materials and Methods: For 93,419 individuals undergoing a 96-gene expanded carrier screen (ECS), correspondence was assessed among carrier status, self-reported ethnicity, and a dual-component genetic ancestry (e.g., 75% African/25% European) calculated from sequencing data. Results: Self-reported ethnicity was an imperfect indicator of genetic ancestry, with 9% of individuals having >50% genetic ancestry from a lineage inconsistent with self-reported ethnicity. Self-reported ethnicity-based carrier-screening guidelines are incomplete, as several conditions not included in guidelines had similarly strong correlation between carrier rate and genetic ancestry as conditions included in screening guidelines. Limitations of self-reported ethnicity led to missed carriers in at-risk populations: for 10 ECS conditions, patients with intermediate genetic ancestry backgrounds (who did not self-report the associated ethnicity) had significantly elevated carrier risk. Finally, for seven of the 16 conditions included in current screening guidelines, most carriers were not from the population the guideline aimed to serve. Conclusion: To provide equitable reproductive care, guidelines should discontinue the use of ethnicity as a basis for determining which patients are appropriate for carrier screening and instead recommend pan-ethnic ECS.","Kaseniit, K.

1035,"Stroke Volume Reserve is an Independent Predictor of Survival and Need for Advanced Therapies in Systolic Heart Failure Patients","Background: We investigated whether stroke volume reserve (STVR) would predict one year mortality and the need for advanced therapies in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) patients. Methods and Results: We retrospectively studied 104 ambulatory patients with HFrEF (59.2 + 10.2 years, 89% male) referred for cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). At 1 year, 39 outcomes were observed: 16 heart transplants (HTx), 8 left ventricular assist devices (LVAD), and 15 deaths. Stroke volume (SV) was determined by the Fick principle with established values for C[a v]O2 at rest and anaerobic threshold (AT). STVR was calculated by SVAT/SVrest. Multi-predictor regression showed a correlation of STVR<1.3 (OR 7.92, p=0.002), cardiac index by right heart catheterization<2 (OR 3.07, p=0.049), and peak VO2 below the ISHLT cut off (OR 4.09, p=0.011). HFrEF patients with a peak VO2 above the ISHLT cut off but STVR<1.3 showed similar survival as patients with low peak VO2 less than the ISHLT cut off. A scoring system was developed: STVR<1.3:2 points, peak VO2 below the ISHLT cut off:1 point, and cardiac index<2: 1 point. A score of >3 demonstrated a sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 79% for 1 year events. Conclusions: STVR is a novel parameter that may better predict 1 year outcomes than peak VO2 in HFrEF patients.

1037,"Use of mobile health apps in low-income populations: a prospective study of facilitators and barriers","Background: Mobile applications (apps) are increasingly popular in healthcare. For low-income populations, barriers exist, yet limited data are available about the challenges and catalysts for adoption. Methods and Results: We partnered with a primary care center and a community organization and recruited patients to use a health app. A community health worker (CHW) consented participants, downloaded the app and instructed on its use, and provided ongoing technical support. Bi-weekly surveys for three months were sent via email/text to assess participant experiences and perceptions. The majority (81 of 108 [75.0%] English language-preferred and 50 of 52 [96.2%] Spanish language-preferred) of patients approached were enrolled. Common reasons for declining were: did not own a smartphone (13.8%), did not have email (20.7%), and not interested (58.6%). Enrollment challenges included: insufficient storage, unfamiliarity with downloading apps, forgotten passwords to email accounts, and slow/absent WiFi connection - which the CHW and the app company were able to address. Most participants, English and Spanish language-preferred respectively, were interested in monitoring their health through an app (74.4%; 70.4%), connecting devices such as FitBits(C) and blood pressure cuffs (78.9%; 50.0%), and being the owner of their health records (83.6%; 95.6%). There were concerns about sharing health information with research teams (66.7%; 51.9%), and data being sold (83.0%; 70.4%). However, many (58.6%; 87.2%) reported being likely to share health data with a trusted research team. Compared with before the study, most felt more comfortable using health apps (67.4%; 82.1%) and more likely to participate in research using apps (76.2%; 72.4%). Conclusions: The assistance of a CHW facilitated the enrollment of low-income individuals in a mobile health app by fostering trust and sustained engagement. Participants were interested in having several app features. Despite concerns about data privacy, they demonstrated greater interest in mobile health app use and research participation at study conclusion.","Liu, P.; Astudillo, K.; Velez, D.; Kelley, L.; Cobbs-Lomax, D.; Spatz, E.",20191229,"Health Systems And Quality Improvement","10.1101/2019.12.22.19015636",1,"Erica Spatz","Yale School of Medicine","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.22.19015636v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.22.19015636v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"All relevant data are within the paper and its Supplementary Materials files."
1039,"Undetectable free aromatic amino acids in nails of breast carcinoma: Biomarkers discovery by a novel metabolite purification VTGE system","BACKGROUND: Metabolic reprogramming in breast cancer is depicted as a crucial change in the tumor microenvironment. Besides the molecular understanding of metabolic heterogeneity, appreciable attentions are drawn to characterize metabolite profiles in tumor tissue and derived biological fluids and tissue materials. Several findings reported on the metabolic alterations of free aromatic amino acids (FAAAs) and other metabolites in biological fluids. Furthermore, there is a significant gap in the development of a suitable method for the purification and analysis of metabolite biomarkers in nails of cancer patients. METHODS: To address the metabolite alterations specifically FAAAs level in nails, fingernail clippings of breast cancer patients (N=10), and healthy subjects (N-12) were used for extraction and purification of metabolites. Here, we report a novel and specifically designed vertical tube gel electrophoresis (VTGE) system that helped for the purification of metabolites in the range of (100-1000 Da) from nail materials. The claimed VTGE system uses 15% polyacrylamide under non-denaturing and non-reducing conditions that makes eluted metabolites directly compatible with LC-HRMS and other analytical techniques. Qualitative and quantitative determination of FAAAs in nail lysates were done by positive ESI mode of Agilent LC-HRMS platform. RESULTS: The analysis on collected data of nail metabolites clearly suggests that FAAAs including tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine and histidine are undetectable in nail lysates of breast cancer over healthy subjects. This is a first report that shows the highly reduced levels of FAAAs in nails of breast cancer. Furthermore, present observation is in consonance with previous findings that support that breast cancer patients show cancer cachexia, high amino acid catabolism that drive metabolite driven cancer growth and proliferation. CONCLUSION: This paper provides a proof of concept for a novel and specifically developed VTGE process that assisted to show the first evidence on undetectable level of FAAAs in nails of breast cancer patients as metabolite biomarkers. Here, the authors propose the potential use of VTGE assisted process to achieve metabolomic discovery in nails of breast cancer and other tumor types.","Mitruka, M.; Gore, C.

1031,"Machine learning suggests polygenic contribution to cognitive dysfunction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a multi-system disease characterized primarily by progressive muscle weakness. Cognitive dysfunction is commonly observed in patients, however factors influencing risk for cognitive dysfunction remain elusive. Using sparse canonical correlation analysis (sCCA), an unsupervised machine-learning technique, we observed that single nucleotide polymorphisms collectively associate with baseline cognitive performance in a large ALS patient cohort from the multicenter Clinical Research in ALS and Related Disorders for Therapeutic Development (CReATe) Consortium (N=327). We demonstrate that a polygenic risk score derived using sCCA relates to longitudinal cognitive decline in the same cohort, and also to in vivo cortical thinning in the orbital frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, lateral temporal cortex, premotor cortex, and hippocampus (N=114) as well as post mortem motor cortical neuronal loss (N=88) in independent ALS cohorts from the University of Pennsylvania Integrated Neurodegenerative Disease Biobank. Our findings suggest that common genetic polymorphisms may exert a polygenic contribution to the risk of cortical disease vulnerability and cognitive dysfunction in ALS.","Placek, K.; Benatar, M.; Wuu, J.; Rampersaud, E.; Hennessy, L.; Van Deerlin, V.

1040,"Prospective assessment of DCE-MRI parameters associated with advanced mandibular osteoradionecrosis after IMRT for head and neck cancer","Purpose: We aim to characterize the quantitative DCE-MRI parameters associated with advanced mandibular osteoradionecrosis (ORN) compared to the contralateral normal mandible. Methods: Patients with the diagnosis of advanced ORN after curative-intent radiation treatment of head and neck cancer were prospectively enrolled after institutional-review board approval and study-specific informed consent. Eligibility criteria included; age>18 years, pathological evidence of head and neck malignancy with history of curative-intent external beam radiotherapy; patients with clinically confirmed high-grade ORN requiring surgical intervention; and no contraindications to MRI. The DCE-MRI acquisition consisted of a variable flip angle T1 mapping sequence and a multi-phase 3D FSPGR sequence. Quantitative maps generated with the Tofts and extended Tofts pharmacokinetic model were used for analysis. Motion correction was applied. Manual segmentation of advanced ORN 3-D volume was done using anatomical sequences (T1, T2, and T1+contrast) to create ORN volumes of interest (ORN-VOIs). Subsequently, normal mandibular VOIs were segmented on the contralateral healthy mandible of similar volume and anatomical location (i.e., mirror image) to create self-control VOIs. Finally, anatomical sequences were co-registered to DCE sequences, and contours were propagated to the respective quantitative parameter maps. Results: Thirty patients were included. Median age at diagnosis was 58 years (range 19-78), and 83% were men. The site of tumor origin was in the oropharynx, oral cavity, salivary glands, and nasopharynx in 13, 9, 6, and 2 patients, respectively. The median time to ORN development after completion of IMRT was 38 months (range 6-184). There were statistically significant higher Ktrans and Ve values in ORN-VOIs compared with controls (0.23 vs. 0.07 min-1, and 0.34 vs. 0.15, p <0.0001 for both) using matched pairs analysis. The average relative increase of Ktrans in ORN-VOIs was 3.2 folds healthy mandibular control VOIs. Moreover, the corresponding rise of Ve in ORN-VOIs was 2.7 folds higher than the controls. Using combined Ktrans and Ve parameters, 27 patients (90%) had at least a 200% increase of either of the studied parameters in the ORN-VOIs compared with their healthy mandible control VOIs. Conclusion: Our results confirm there is a quantitatively significant higher degree of leakiness in the mandibular vasculature as measured using DCE-MRI parameters of areas affected with an advanced grade of ORN versus healthy mandible. We were able to measure significant increases in quantitative metrics compared to values from the non-ORN mandibular bone. Further efforts are ongoing to validate these findings to enable the use of these DCE-MRI parameter thresholds for the early detection of subclinical cases of ORN.","Joint Head And Neck Radiotherapy-Mri Development Cooperative,  ; Mohamed, A.

These findings remained consistent in sensitivity analyses that were robust to the presence of pleiotropic variants. Results from analyses considering individual-participant data were similar, even after adjustment for clinical covariates, including left atrial size. Conclusions: Genetically predicted height is a positive causal risk factor for AF. This finding raises the possibility of investigating height/growth-related pathways as a means for gaining novel mechanistic insights to atrial fibrillation, as well as incorporating height into population screening strategies for atrial fibrillation.","Levin, M.

1052,"Hospital admission with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with increased all-cause mortality independent of cardiovascular risk factors","Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common and strongly associated with the metabolic syndrome. Though NAFLD may progress to end-stage liver disease, the top cause of mortality in NAFLD is cardiovascular disease (CVD). Most of the data on liver-related mortality in NAFLD derives from specialist liver centres. We aimed to assess mortality in NAFLD when adjusting for CVD in a real world cohort of inpatients. Methods: Retrospective study of hospitalised patients with 14-years follow-up. NAFL (non-alcoholic fatty liver), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and NAFLD-cirrhosis groups were defined by ICD-10 codes using ACALM methodology. Cases were age-/sex-matched 1:10 with non-NAFLD hospitalised patients from the ACALM registry. All-cause mortality was compared between groups using cox regression adjusted for CVD and metabolic syndrome risk factors. Results: We identified 1238 patients with NAFL, 105 with NASH and 1235 with NAFLD-cirrhosis. There was an increasing burden of cardiovascular disease with progression from NAFL to NASH to cirrhosis. After adjustment for demographics, metabolic syndrome components and cardiovascular disease, patients with NAFL, NASH, and cirrhosis all had increased all-cause mortality (HR 1.3 (CI 1.1-1.5), HR 1.5 (CI 1.0-2.3) and HR 3.5 (CI 3.3-3.9), respectively). Hepatic decompensation (NAFL HR 8.0 (CI 6.1-10.4), NASH HR 6.5 (2.7-15.4) and cirrhosis HR 85.8 (CI 72-104)), and hepatocellular carcinoma were increased in all NAFLD groups. Conclusion: There is a high burden of cardiovascular disease in NAFLD-cirrhosis patients. From a large real-life non-specialist registry of hospitalized patients, NAFLD patients have increased overall mortality and rate of liver-related complications compared to controls after adjusting for cardiovascular disease.","Mann, J.

1041,"Emergence of mcr-9.1 in ESBL-producing Clinical Enterobacteriaceae in Pretoria, South Africa: Global Evolutionary Phylogenomics, Resistome and Mobilome.","Background. Extended-spectrum {beta}-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae are critical-priority pathogens that cause substantial fatalities. With the emergence of mobile mcr genes mediating resistance to colistin in Enterobacteriaceae, clinicians are now left with little therapeutic options. Methods. Eleven clinical Enterobacteriaceae strains with resistance to cephems and/or colistin were genomically analysed to determine their resistome, mobilome, and evolutionary relationship to global strains. The global phylogenomics of mcr-9.1-bearing genomes were further analysed. Results & conclusion. Ten isolates were ESBL positive. The isolates were multidrug-resistant and phylogenetically related to global clones, but distant from local strains. Multiple resistance genes, including blaCTX-M-15 blaTEM-1 and mcr-9.1 were found in single isolates; ISEc9, IS19, and Tn3 transposons bracketed blaCTX-M-15 and blaTEM-1. Common plasmid types included IncF, IncH and ColRNAI. Genomes bearing mcr-9.1 clustered into six main phyletic groups (A-F), with those of this study belonging to clade B. Enterobacter sp. and Salmonella sp. are the main hosts of mcr-9.1 globally, albeit diverse promiscuous plasmids disseminate mcr-9.1 across different bacterial species. Emergence of mcr-9.1 in ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae in South Africa is worrying due to the restricted therapeutic options. Intensive One Health molecular surveillance might discover other mcr alleles and inform infection management and antibiotic choices.","Osei Sekyere, J.; Maningi, N. E.; Modipane, L.; Mbelle, N.

1051,"Global Trends of Seroprevalence and Universal Screening Policy for Chagas Disease in Donors: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: Screening for Trypanosoma cruzi among blood and organ donors is essential to reduce Chagas disease transmission. The World Health Organization (WHO) has prioritised curtailing transmission in blood banks (BBs) and transplantation centres (TCs) by 50% by 2025 and 100% by 2030. This study aims to update the situation on T. cruzi screening strategies in BBs and TCs to evaluate the evolution of seroprevalence and the achievement of screening milestones globally. Methods: We used published articles and government reports on seroprevalence data and screening policies in BBs and TCs across the world. We conducted meta-analyses of T. cruzi seroprevalence estimates by who region, endemicity status, and country, and used meta-regression to identify the covariates influencing the estimates. Publication bias and sensitivity analyses were also conducted. Results: Based on 99 studies and reports and found a global pattern of increased universal screening policies (USPs) in BBs from 1990 to 2018. We found information for 50 countries, of which 44 (88%) have implemented USPs and 21 (42%) achieved 100% coverage by 2015. Out of the 21 Chagas-disease endemic countries, 20 are in advanced USP stages, and 18 achieved 100% coverage by 2015. Latin America (LA) was the first region to start USP since the 1990s and 19 countries are in advanced stages of implementation and by 2015 there is evidence of 100% coverage in 15 LA countries. In the Caribbean Region, USPs are still in early implementation stages and by 2015 only five out of 24 countries have achieved 100% coverage. Outside Latin America and the Caribbean, there are USPs only in the USA, which initiated in 2007 and with 100% coverage in 2016. In Europe, there are no USPs, but some countries have implemented selective screening of at-risk donors in the UK, Spain, France and Switzerland. Whereas Sweden and Italy have implemented a deferral system. For TCs, national guidelines have been produced in some European countries since the 2000s; in the USA, USPs started since 2002, but 100% coverage is yet to be achieved. There is a global decrease in T. cruzi seroprevalence among blood donors from the 1970s to 2010s, particularly in endemic countries, where the T. cruzi pooled seroprevalence decreased from 2.42% (95% CI 0.75%-7.53%) in the 1970s to 0.38% (95% CI 0.30%-0.60%) in the 2010s. Seroprevalence in non-endemic countries has remained relatively stable between 1990s and 2010s around 0.01% (95% CI 0.01%-0.03%). Country and decade were identified as the two major predictors of seroprevalence in BBs. Data on TCs was scarce. Interpretation: Despite global progress in T. cruzi screening policies, both USPs and 100% coverage are yet to be achieved. Seroprevalence in BBs have decreased in endemic countries, likely due to a combination of vector control, increased USPs and voluntary donation, and improved diagnosis.

1042,"Surgical site infection and its associated factors in Ethiopia: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: Despite being a preventable complication of surgical procedures surgical site infections (SSIs) continue to threaten public health with significant impacts on the patients and the health-care human and financial resources. With millions affected globally,there issignificant variation in the primary studies on the prevalence of SSIs in Ethiopia. Therefore this study aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of SSI and its associated factors among postoperative patients in Ethiopia. Methods: PubMed Scopus Psyinfo African Journals Online and Google Scholar were searched for studies that looked at SSI in postoperative patients. A funnel plot and Egger s regression test were used to determine publication bias. The I2 statistic was used to check heterogeneity between the studies. DerSimonian and Laird random effects model was applied to estimate the pooled effect size, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence interval (CIs) across studies. The subgroup analysis was conducted by region, sample size, and year of publication. Sensitivity analysis was deployed to determine the effect of a single study on the overall estimation. Analysis was done using STATA Version 14 software. Result: A total of 24 studies with 13,136 study participants were included in this study. The estimated pooled prevalence of SSI in Ethiopia was 12.3% (95% CI: 10.19, 14.42). Duration of surgery > 1 hour (AOR = 1.78; 95% CI: 1.08 2.94), diabetes mellitus (AOR = 3.25; 95% CI: 1.51 6.99) American Society of Anaesthesiologists score >1 (AOR = 2.51; 95% CI: 1.07 5.91), previous surgery (AOR = 2.5; 95% CI: 1.77 3.53), clean-contaminated wound (AOR = 2.15; 95% CI: 1.52 3.04), and preoperative hospital stay > 7 day (AOR = 5.76; 95% CI: 1.15 28.86) were significantly associated with SSI. Conclusion: The prevalence of SSI among postoperative patients in Ethiopia remains high with a pooled prevalence of 12.3% in 24 extracted studies. Therefore situation based interventions and region context-specific preventive strategies should be developed to reduce the prevalence of SSI among postoperative patients.","Shiferaw, W.

1028,"Identifying groups of people with similar sociobehavioural characteristics in Malawi to inform HIV interventions: a Latent Class Analysis","Background: Within many sub-Saharan African countries including Malawi, HIV prevalence varies widely between regions. This variability may be related to the distribution of population groups with specific sociobehavioural characteristics that influence the transmission of HIV and the uptake of prevention. In this study, we intended to identify groups of people in Malawi with similar risk profiles. Methods: We used data from the Demographic and Health Survey in Malawi from 2016, and stratified the analysis by sex. We considered demographic, socio-behavioural and HIV-related variables. Using Latent Class Analysis (LCA), we identified clusters of people sharing common sociobehavioural characteristics. The optimal number of clusters was selected based on the Bayesian information criterion. We compared the proportions of individuals belonging to the different clusters across the three regions and 28 districts of Malawi. Results: We found nine clusters of women and six clusters of men. Most women in the clusters with highest risk of being HIV infected were living in female-headed households and were formerly married or in a union. Among men, older men had the highest risk of being HIV infected, followed by young (20-25) single men. Generally, low HIV testing uptake correlated with lower risk of having HIV. However, rural adolescent girls had a low probability of being tested (48.7%) despite a relatively high HIV prevalence. Urban districts and Southern region had a higher percentage of high-prevalence and less tested clusters of individuals than other areas. Conclusions: LCA is an efficient method to find clusters of people sharing common HIV risk profiles, identify particularly vulnerable population groups, and plan targeted interventions focusing on these groups. Tailored support, prevention and HIV testing programmes should focus particularly on female household heads, adolescent girls living in rural areas, older married men, and young men who have never been married.","Merzouki, A.; Styles, A.; Estill, J.; Baranczuk, Z.; Petrie, K.; Keiser, O.",20191227,"Public And Global Health","10.1101/2019.12.26.19015560",1,"Aziza Merzouki","University of Geneva","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.26.19015560v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.26.19015560v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"The data generated by our analysis and the R code we developed for this work are available online."
1044,"Coagulation factor XII, XI, and VIII activity levels and secondary events after first ischemic stroke","Background and Purpose: Though risk for recurrent vascular events is high following ischemic stroke, little is known about risk factors for secondary events post-stroke. The coagulation factors XII, XI, and VII (FXII, FXI, and FVIII) have already been implicated in first thrombotic events, and our aim was to estimate their effects on vascular outcomes within 3 years after first stroke. Methods: In the PROSpective Cohort with Incident Stroke Berlin (PROSCIS-B) study, we followed participants aged 18 and older for three years after first mild to moderate ischemic stroke event or until occurrence of recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction or all-cause mortality (combined endpoint). High coagulation factor activity levels were compared to normal and low levels, and activities were also analyzed as continuous variables. We used Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the combined endpoint. Results: In total, 92 events occurred in 570 included participants, resulting in an absolute rate of 6.6 events per 100 person-years. After confounding adjustment, high FVIII activity showed the strongest relationship with the combined endpoint (HR=2.05, 95%CI 1.28-3.29). High FXI activity was also associated with an increased risk (HR=1.80, 95%CI 1.09-2.98). Contrarily, high FXII activity was not associated with the combined endpoint (HR=0.86, 95%CI 0.49-1.51). Continuous analyses per standard deviation of each biomarker yielded similar results. Conclusions: In our study of mild to moderate ischemic stroke patients, high activity levels of FXI and FVIII but not FXII were associated with worse vascular outcomes in the three-year period after first ischemic stroke. This is of special interest in light of the ongoing trials of antithrombotic treatments targeting FXI.","Rohmann, J. L.; Huo, S.; Sperber, P. S.; Piper, S. K.; Rosendaal, F. R.; Heuschmann, P.

1050,"Statistical inference for association studies using electronic health records: handling both selection bias and outcome misclassification","Health research using electronic health records (EHR) has gained popularity, but misclassification of EHR-derived disease status and lack of representativeness of the study sample can result in substantial bias in effect estimates and can impact power and type I error. In this paper, we develop new strategies for handling disease status misclassification and selection bias in EHR-based association studies. We first focus on each type of bias separately. For misclassification, we propose three novel likelihood-based bias correction strategies. A distinguishing feature of the EHR setting is that misclassification may be related to patient-specific factors, and the proposed methods leverage data in the EHR to estimate misclassification rates without gold standard labels. For addressing selection bias, we describe how calibration and inverse probability weighting methods from the survey sampling literature can be extended and applied to the EHR setting. Addressing misclassification and selection biases simultaneously is a more challenging problem than dealing with each on its own, and we propose several new strategies to address this situation. For all methods proposed, we derive valid standard errors and provide software for implementation. We provide a new suite of statistical estimation and inference strategies for addressing misclassification and selection bias simultaneously that is tailored to problems arising in EHR data analysis. We apply these methods to data from The Michigan Genomics Initiative (MGI), a longitudinal EHR-linked biorepository.","Beesley, L.

1043,"To resect or not to resect? Unbiased performances of single and combined biomarkers in intra-operative corticography for tailoring during epilepsy surgery.","Objective: Signal analysis biomarkers, in an intra-operative setting, may be complementary tools to guide and tailor the resection in drug-resistant epilepsy patients. Unbiased assessment of biomarker performances are needed to evaluate their clinical usefulness and translation. We defined a realistic ground-truth scenario and compared the effectiveness of different biomarkers alone and combined to localize epileptogenic tissue. Methods: We investigated the performances of univariate, bivariate and multivariate signal biomarkers applied to 1 minute inter-ictal intra-operative electrocorticography to discriminate between electrodes covering normal or pathologic activity in 47 drug-resistant people with epilepsy (temporal and extra-temporal) who had been seizure-free one year after the operation. Results: The best result using a single biomarker was obtained using the phase-amplitude coupling measure for which the epileptogenic tissue was localized in 16 out of 47 patients. Combining the whole set of biomarkers provided an improvement of the performances: 20 out of 47 patients. Repeating the analysis only on the temporal-lobe resections we reached a sensitivity of 93% (28 out of 30) combining all the biomarkers. Conclusion: We suggest that the assessment of biomarker performances on a ground-truth scenario is required to have a proper estimate on how biomarkers translate into clinical use. Phase-amplitude coupling seems the best performing single biomarker and combining biomarkers improves localization of epileptogenic tissue. However, sensitivity achieved is not adequate for the usage as a tool in the operation theater, but it can improve the understanding of pathophysiological process.","Demuru, M.; Kalitzin, S.; Zweiphenning, W.; Van Blooijs, D.; Van 'T Klooster, M.; Van Eijsden, P.; Leijten, F.; Zijlmans, M.",20191230,"Neurology","10.1101/2019.12.26.19015883",1,"Matteo Demuru","Stichting Epilepsie Instellingen Nederland","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.26.19015883v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.26.19015883v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"no sharing of the data"
1048,"Accurate and reproducible prediction of ICU readmissions","Readmission in the intensive care unit (ICU) is associated with poor clinical outcomes and high costs. Traditional scoring methods to help clinicians deciding whether a patient is ready for discharge have failed to meet expectations, paving the way for machine learning based approaches. Freely available datasets such as MIMIC-III have served as benchmarking media to compare such tools. We used the OMOP-CDM version of MIMIC-III (MIMIC-OMOP) to train and evaluate a lightweight tree boosting method to predict readmission in ICU at different time points after discharge (3, 7, 15 and 30 days), outperforming existing solutions with an AUROC of 0.802 (SD=0.011) and a recall of 0.837 (SD=0.016) for 3-days readmission.","Nguyen, D.-P.; Paris, N.; Parrot, A.",20191230,"Intensive Care And Critical Care Medicine","10.1101/2019.12.26.19015909",1,"Dinh-Phong Nguyen","AP-HP","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.26.19015909v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.26.19015909v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"All data used and code are freely accessible."
1045,"Home Use of a Wireless Intracortical Brain-Computer Interface by Individuals With Tetraplegia","Individuals with neurological disease or injury such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord injury or stroke may become tetraplegic, unable to speak or even locked-in. For people with these conditions, current assistive technologies are often ineffective. Brain-computer interfaces are being developed to enhance independence and restore communication in the absence of physical movement. Over the past decade, individuals with tetraplegia have achieved rapid on-screen typing and point-and-click control of tablet apps using intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) that decode intended arm and hand movements from neural signals recorded by implanted microelectrode arrays. However, cables used to convey neural signals from the brain tether participants to amplifiers and decoding computers and require expert oversight during use, severely limiting when and where iBCIs could be available for use. Here, we demonstrate the first human use of a wireless broadband iBCI. Based on a prototype system previously used in pre-clinical research, we replaced the external cables of a 192-electrode iBCI with wireless transmitters and achieved high-resolution recording and decoding of broadband field potentials and spiking activity from people with paralysis. Two participants in an ongoing pilot clinical trial performed on-screen item selection tasks to assess iBCI-enabled cursor control. Communication bitrates were equivalent between cabled and wireless configurations. Participants also used the wireless iBCI to control a standard commercial tablet computer to browse the web and use several mobile applications. Within-day comparison of cabled and wireless interfaces evaluated bit error rate, packet loss, and the recovery of spike rates and spike waveforms from the recorded neural signals. In a representative use case, the wireless system recorded intracortical signals from two arrays in one participant continuously through a 24-hour period at home. Wireless multi-electrode recording of broadband neural signals over extended periods introduces a valuable tool for human neuroscience research and is an important step toward practical deployment of iBCI technology for independent use by individuals with paralysis. On-demand access to high-performance iBCI technology in the home promises to enhance independence and restore communication and mobility for individuals with severe motor impairment.","Simeral, J.

1047,"Diabetes mellitus, glycemic traits, and cerebrovascular disease: a Mendelian randomization study","Rationale: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is an established risk factor for cerebrovascular disease but the mechanisms underlying this association remain elusive. Disentangling the causal effects of T2D, hyperglycemia, and pre-diabetic phenotypes (insulin resistance, {beta}-cell dysfunction) on major etiological stroke subtypes (ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke subtypes) could inform the development of preventive strategies. Objective: We employed Mendelian randomization (MR) to explore the effects of genetic predisposition to T2D, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and {beta}-cell dysfunction on risk of stroke subtypes and related cerebrovascular phenotypes. Methods and Results: We selected instruments for genetic predisposition to T2D, HbA1c levels, fasting glucose levels, insulin resistance, and {beta}-cell dysfunction (proxied by pro-insulin levels) based on published genome-wide association studies (up to 898,130 individuals). Applying two-sample MR, we examined associations with ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and ischemic stroke subtypes (large artery, cardioembolic, small vessel stroke; up to 60,341 cases and 454,450 controls). We further explored associations with the related phenotypes of carotid atherosclerosis, imaging markers of cerebral white matter integrity, and brain atrophy. Genetic predisposition to T2D and elevated HbA1c levels in the pre-diabetic range were associated with higher risk of any ischemic stroke, large artery stroke, carotid plaque and small vessel stroke. Independently of HbA1c levels, we further found genetic predisposition to insulin resistance to be associated with large artery and small vessel stroke, whereas predisposition to {beta}-cell dysfunction was associated with small vessel stroke. Predisposition to {beta}-cell dysfunction was further associated with intracerebral hemorrhage, lower grey matter volume, and total brain volume. Conclusions: This study supports causal effects of T2D and hyperglycemia on large artery and small vessel stroke. We show differential effects of genetically determined insulin resistance and {beta}-cell dysfunction on large artery and small vessel stroke that might have implications for anti-diabetic treatments targeting these mechanisms.","Georgakis, M.

1046,"Radiomics Features of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron-Emission Tomography as a Novel Prognostic Signature in Colorectal Cancer","Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of radiomics signatures derived from 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron-emission tomography (PET) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods: From April 2008 to Jan 2014, we identified CRC patients who underwent 18F-FDG-PET before starting any neoadjuvant treatments and surgery. Radiomics features were extracted from the primary lesions identified on 18F-FDG-PET. Patients were divided into a training and a validation set by random sampling. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression model was applied for prognostic signature building with progression-free survival (PFS) using the training set. Using the calculated radiomics score, a nomogram was developed, and the clinical utility of this nomogram was assessed in the validation set. Results: Three-hundred-and-eight-one patients with surgically resected CRC patients (training set 228 vs. validation set 153) were included. In the training set, a radiomics signature called a rad_score was generated using two PET-derived features such as Gray Level Run Length Matrix_Long-Run Emphasis (GLRLM_LRE) and Grey-Level Zone Length Matrix_Short-Zone Low Gray-level Emphasis (GLZLM_SZLGE). Patients with a high-rad_score in the training and validation set had shorter PFS. Multivariable analysis revealed that the rad_score was an independent prognostic factor in both training and validation sets. A radiomics nomogram, developed using rad_score, nodal stage, and lymphovascular invasion, showed good performance in the calibration curve and comparable predictive power with the staging system in the validation set. Conclusion: Textural features derived from 18F-FDG-PET images may enable more detailed stratification of prognosis in patients with CRC.","Kang, J.; Lee, J.-H.; Lee, H. S.; Cho, E.-S.; Park, E.

1038,"Timing and nature of palliative care discussions are patient-specific according to clinicians: a qualitative study","Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with an unpredictable and complex disease trajectory. Consequently, most patients are not involved in advance care planning and do not receive palliative care until the end of life. Aim: To explore clinicians experiences, opinions and recommendations for the timing and nature of palliative care discussions in COPD. Design: Qualitative interviews with nurses and doctors that provide direct care to COPD patients. Setting/Participants: 14 clinicians working across primary and secondary care in the UK were interviewed. Results: Participants suggested that those with the appropriate expertise and an established relationship with patients were best placed to initiate discussions about palliative and future care. Early, gradual and informed palliative and future care discussions were considered best practice, however they uncommon occurrence due to service, patient and clinician-related barriers. The unpredictable disease trajectory and fine balance between providing acute care and discussing palliative care options were suggested as key greatest barriers for discussions. However, damaging patient hope was a concern for clinicians and reduced their inclination to discuss palliative care. Clinicians did not seem to think that patients were ready for discussions, therefore they avoided broaching the subject leading early in the disease trajectory. Conclusion: Stand-alone conversations about and near the end of life was described as current usual practice by clinicians, however individualised early, regular and gradual discussions with patients about immediate and long-term future plans may make such discussions feel less negative and ordinary for patients and clinicians.","Tavares, N.; Wilkinson, T.; Jarrett, N.; Hunt, K.",20191229,"Palliative Medicine","10.1101/2019.12.28.19013417",1,"Nuno Tavares","Solent University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.28.19013417v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.28.19013417v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"Data may be obtained from a third party and are not publicly available"
