3,"Genome-wide postnatal changes in immunity following fetal inflammatory response","The fetal inflammatory response (FIR) increases the risk of perinatal brain injury, particularly in extremely low gestational age newborns (ELGANs, < 28 weeks of gestation). One of the mechanisms contributing to such a risk is a postnatal intermittent or sustained systemic inflammation (ISSI) following FIR. The link between prenatal and postnatal systemic inflammation is supported by the presence of well-established inflammatory biomarkers in the umbilical cord and peripheral blood. However, the extent of molecular changes contributing to this association is unknown. Using RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry proteomics, we profiled the transcriptome and proteome of archived neonatal dried blood spot (DBS) specimens from 21 ELGANs. Comparing FIR-affected and unaffected ELGANs, we identified 783 gene and 27 protein expression changes of 50% magnitude or more, and an experiment-wide significance level below 5% false discovery rate. These expression changes confirm the robust postnatal activation of the innate immune system in FIR-affected ELGANs and reveal an impairment of their adaptive immunity. In turn, the altered pathways provide clues about the molecular mechanisms triggering ISSI after FIR, and the onset of perinatal brain injury.","Costa, D.; Bonet, N.; Sole, A.; Gonzalez De Aledo-Castillo, J.

4,"Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis patient perspectives on clinical trials and participation","Background: Clinical trial recruitment is often the rate-limiting step in the development of new treatments reaching patients across all disease states. With more than 1500 currently available clinical trials for inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) patients, it is important to understand patient perceptions of clinical trial participation to improve recruitment and retention. This study aimed to examine the specific challenges and barriers that might be reducing IBD patient enrollment and potential methods to overcome these barriers. Methods: Five in-person patient focus groups were conducted from February through May 2016 using two facilitation guides. Participants self-reported a diagnosis of Crohns disease or ulcerative colitis. Results: The five focus groups included a total of 34 participants. Participants discussed several barriers, including fears, disease severity at trial onset, potential adverse effects, time constraints, and the influence of both their primary IBD provider and support network. Methods to improve participation included better communication to prospective patients, reduced length of trial and time commitment, lower placebo rates, the option of open label extension, and support of the patient primary IBD provider. Conclusions: This is the first study to examine patient perceptions for IBD clinical trial enrollment, including barriers to participation and methods to improve participation. Fear and misunderstanding of clinical trials, engagement with providers, limiting time demands, and limiting the impact on work and family were found to be barriers to participation. Creative solutions to these problems could lead to greater participation in trials and more rapid advancement of new therapies to clinical approval and use.","Orna G Ehrlich; James Testaverde; Caren Heller; Stuart Daman; Annick Anderson; Peter D.r.

5,"Updating Insights into Rosiglitazone and Cardiovascular Risk through Shared Data: Individual Patient-and-Summary-Level Meta-Analyses","Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of rosiglitazone therapy on cardiovascular risk and mortality using multiple data sources and varying analytical approaches. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Data sources: GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) Clinical Study Data Request (CSDR) and Study Register platforms, MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Registry of Controlled Trials, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to January 2019. Study selection criteria: Randomized, controlled, phase II-IV clinical trials comparing rosiglitazone with any control for at least 24 weeks in adults. Data extraction and synthesis: For analyses of trials for which individual patient-level data (IPD) were available, we examined a composite of the following events as our primary outcome: acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiovascular-related deaths, and non-cardiovascular-related deaths. As secondary analyses, these four events were examined independently. When also including trials for which IPD were not available, we examined myocardial infarction and cardiovascular-related deaths, ascertained from summary-level data. Multiple meta-analyses were conducted, accounting for trials with zero events in one or all arms with two different continuity corrections (i.e., 0.5 constant and treatment arm comparator continuity correction), to calculate odds ratios and risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals. Results: There were 33 eligible trials for which IPD were available (21156 participants) through GSK's CSDR. We also identified 103 additional trials for which IPD were not available from which we ascertained myocardial infarctions (23683 patients) and 103 trials for cardiovascular-related deaths (22772 patients). Among trials for which IPD were available, we identified a greater number of myocardial infarctions and fewer cardiovascular-related deaths reported in the IPD as compared to the summary-level data. When limited to trials for which IPD were available and accounting for trials with zero-events in only one arm using a constant continuity correction of 0.5, patients treated with rosiglitazone had a 39% increased risk of a composite event compared with controls (Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio 1.39, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.68). When examined separately, the odds ratios for myocardial infarction, heart failure, cardiovascular-related death, and non-cardiovascular-related death were 1.25 (0.99 to 1.60), 1.60 (1.20 to 2.14), 1.18 (0.64 to 2.17), and 1.13 (0.58 to 2.20), respectively. When all trials for which IPD were and were not available were combined for myocardial infarction and cardiovascular-related deaths, the odds ratios were attenuated (1.13 (0.92 to 1.38) and 1.10 (0.73 to 1.65), respectively). Effect estimates and 95% confidence intervals were broadly consistent when analyses were repeated including trials with zero events across all arms using constant continuity corrections of 0.5 or treatment arm continuity corrections. Conclusions: Results of this comprehensive meta-analysis aggregating a multitude of trials and analyzed using a variety of statistical techniques suggest that rosiglitazone is consistently associated with an increased cardiovascular risk, likely driven by heart failure events, whose interpretation is complicated by varying magnitudes of myocardial infarction risk that were attenuated through aggregation of summary-level data in addition to IPD.","Joshua D Wallach; Kun Wang; Audrey D Zhang; Deanna Chang; Holly K Grossetta Nardini; Haiqun Lin; Michael B Bracken; Mayur Desai; Harlan Krumholz; Joseph S.

6,"Predicting epileptic seizures using nonnegative matrix factorization","This paper presents a procedure for the patient-specific prediction of epileptic seizures. To this end, a combination of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and smooth basis functions with robust regression is applied to power spectra of intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) signals. The resulting time and frequency components capture the dominant information from power spectra, while removing outliers and noise. This makes it possible to detect structure in preictal states, which is used for classification. Linear support vector machines (SVM) with L1 regularization are used to select and weigh the contributions from different number of not equally informative channels among patients. Due to class imbalance in data, synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) is applied. The resulting method yields a computationally and conceptually simple, interpretable model of EEG signals of preictal and interictal states, which shows a good performance for the task of seizure prediction.","Olivera Stojanovic; Gordon Pipa",20190625,"Health Informatics","10.1101/19000430",1,"Olivera Stojanovic","Institute of Cognitive Science, University of Osnabrueck","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000430v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000430v1.full.pdf","cc_by","10.1371/journal.pone.0228025","The data used in this project is a part of the EPILEPSIAE dataset, which is not publicly available.

7,"Prospective and External Evaluation of a Machine Learning Model to Predict In-Hospital Mortality","The ability to accurately predict in-hospital mortality for patients at the time of admission could improve clinical and operational decision-making and outcomes. Few machine learning models have been developed to predict in-hospital death that are both broadly applicable to all adult patients across a health system and readily implementable, and, to the best of our knowledge, none have been implemented, evaluated prospectively, or externally validated. The primary objective of this study was to prospectively and externally validate a machine learning model that predicts in-hospital mortality for all adult patients at the time of hospital admission. Model performance was quantified using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision recall curve (AUPRC). Secondary objectives were to design the model using commonly available EHR data and accessible computational methods. A total of 75,247 hospital admissions (median [IQR] age 59.5 [29.0] years; male [45.9%]) were included in the study. The in-hospital mortality rates for the training validation, retrospective validations at Hospitals A, B, and C, and prospective validation cohorts, respectively, were 3.0%, 2.7%, 1.8%, 2.1%, and 1.6%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROCs), respectively, were 0.87 (0.83-0.89), 0.85 (0.83-0.87), 0.89 (0.86-0.92), 0.84 (0.80-0.89), and 0.86 (0.83-0.90). The area under the precision recall curves (AUPRCs), respectively, were 0.29 (0.25-0.37), 0.17 (0.13-0.22), 0.22 (0.14-0.31), 0.13 (0.08-0.21), and 0.14 (0.09-0.21). The results demonstrated accurate prediction of in-hospital mortality for adult patients at the time of admission. The data elements, methods, and patient selection make the model implementable at a system-level.","Nathan Brajer; Brian Cozzi; Michael Gao; Mike Revoir; Marshall Nichols; Joseph Futoma; Jonathan Bae; Noppon Setji; Suresh Balu; Adrian Hernandez; Mark Sendak",20190625,"Health Systems And Quality Improvement","10.1101/19000133",1,"Nathan Brajer","Duke University School of Medicine","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000133v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000133v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"This study used electronic health record data from Duke University Health System.

9,"Trends and variation in unsafe prescribing of methotrexate: a cohort study in English NHS primary care.","Objective To describe trends and geographical variation in methotrexate prescribing that breaches national safety recommendations; deaths from methotrexate poisoning; and associated litigation. Methods A retrospective cohort study of English NHS primary care prescribing data, complemented by information obtained through Freedom of Information (FOI) requests. The main outcome measures were: (1) variation in ratio of breaching / adherent prescribing, geographically and over time, between General Practices and Clinical Commissioning Groups; (2) description of responses to FOI requests. Results Out of 7349 NHS General Practices in England, 1689 practices prescribed both 2.5mg and 10mg tablets to individual patients in 2017, breaching national guidance. In April 2018, 697 practices (at the 90th centile and above) prescribed at least 14.3% of all methotrexate as 10mg tablets, breaching national guidance. The 66 practices at the 99th percentile and above gave at least 52.4% of all prescribed methotrexate in the form of 10 mg tablets. The prescribing of 10mg tablets has fallen over 7 years, with 10mg tablets as a proportion of all methotrexate tablets falling from 9.1% to 3.4%. 21 deaths caused by methotrexate poisoning have been reported from 1993-2017. Conclusions The prevalence of unsafe methotrexate prescribing has reduced but it remains common, with substantial variation between organisations. We recommend the NHS invests in better strategies around implementation of safety recommendations. 21 deaths have been attributed to methotrexate poisoning but with no further details easily available: the full coroners reports for these deaths should be reviewed to identify recurring themes.","Mackenna, B.; Curtis, H.

10,"18F-AV1451 PET imaging and white matter changes in progressive supranuclear palsy","Introduction: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is characterized by deposition of straight filament tau aggregates in the grey matter of deep nuclei and cerebellum. White matter changes are increasingly documented as a feature of degenerative parkinsonism. We therefore examined the relationship between tau pathology (assessed via 18F-AV1451 positron emission tomography) and white matter integrity (using diffusion tensor imaging, DTI) in PSP. Methods: Twenty-three people with clinically probable PSP-Richardson's syndrome (age 68.8 +/- 5.8 years, 39% female) and 23 controls underwent structural 3T brain MRI including DTI. Twenty-one patients also underwent 18F-AV145 PET imaging. DTI group comparisons were performed using Fractional Anisotropy (FA), Mean Diffusivity (MD) and Radial Diffusivity (RD). Voxel-wise white matter integrity was correlated with 18F-AV1451 binding in typical subcortical PSP regions of interest (i.e. putamen, pallidum, thalamus and midbrain). DTI and 18F-AV1451 imaging measures were correlated with clinical impairment. Results: Widespread DTI changes in PSP subjects relative to controls (family-wise error FWE p<0.01) were observed. In PSP, higher 18F-AV1451 binding correlated with reduced white matter integrity in the bilateral internal capsule, corona radiata, and superior longitudinal fasciculus (FWE p<0.05). Association between cognitive impairment (ACER score) and white matter deficits were found in the genu of corpus callosum and cingulum (p<0.005). Conclusion: This cross-sectional study demonstrates an association between in vivo proxy measures of tau pathology and white matter degeneration in PSP. Longitudinal studies and more specific PET probes for non-Alzheimer tauopathies are warranted to assess the complex interplay between microstructural changes and protein deposition in PSP.","Nicolas Nicastro; Patricia Vazquez Rodriguez; Maura Malpetti; W.

11,"Perception of whole-body motion during balance perturbations is impaired in Parkinson's disease and is associated with balance impairment","Background: In addition to motor deficits, Parkinson's disease (PD) may cause perceptual impairments. The role of perceptual impairments in sensorimotor function is unclear, and has typically been studied in single-joint motions. Research Question: We hypothesized that perception of whole-body motion is impaired in PD and contributes to balance impairments. We tested 1) whether directional acuity to whole body perturbations during standing was worse in people with PD compared to neurotypical older adults (NOA), and 2) whether balance ability, as assessed by the MiniBESTest, was associated with poor directional acuity in either group. Methods: Participants were exposed to pairs of support-surface translation perturbations in a two-alternative forced choice testing paradigm developed previously in a young healthy population. The first perturbation of each pair was directly backward and the second deviated to the left or right (1 degree-44 degrees). Participants judged and reported whether the perturbations in each pair were in the ""same"" or ""different"" direction. This information was used to calculate directional acuity thresholds corresponding to ""just-noticeable differences"" in perturbation direction. Linear mixed models determined associations between directional thresholds and clinical variables including MDS UPDRS-III score, age, and MiniBESTest score. Results: 20 PD (64+/-7 y, 12 male, >=12 hours since last intake of antiparkinsonian medications) and 12 NOA (64+/-8, 6 male) were assessed. Directional thresholds were higher (worse) among PD participants (17.6+/-5.9 degrees vs. 12.8+/-3.3 degrees, P<0.01). Linear mixed models further showed that higher thresholds were associated with MDS UPDRS-III score (P<0.01), and were associated with poorer balance ability among PD participants (P<0.01), but not among NOA participants (P=0.40). Significance: Perception of whole-body motion is impaired in PD and may contribute to impaired balance and falls.","Sistania M Bong; Jl Mckay; Stewart A Factor; Lena H Ting",20190625,"Neurology","10.1101/19000265",1,"Lena H Ting","Emory University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000265v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000265v1.full.pdf","cc_by","10.1016/j.gaitpost.2019.10.029","Data will be provided as supplemental information with the manuscript upon journal acceptance.",4
13,"Proximal and distal factors predicting timely initiation of breastfeeding in Ethiopia: a systematic review and meta-analysis","Background: In Ethiopia, the current coverage of timely initiation of breast feeding (TIBF) has fallen short of the National Health Sector Transformation Plan 2016-2020, National Nutrition Program 2016-2020 and WHO global target. This calls for the need to assess relevant proximal and distal factors that affect the rate of TIBF in Ethiopia. Objective: The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate the association between TIBF and educational status, household income, marital status, media exposure, and parity in Ethiopia. Methods: Databases used were PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, SCOPUS, CINAHL and WHO Global health library, and key terms were searched using interactive searching syntax. It was also supplemented by manual searching. Observational studies published between September 2000 and March 2019 were included. The methodological quality of studies was examined using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) for cross-sectional studies. Data were extracted using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) data extraction tool. To obtain the pooled odds ratio (OR), extracted data were fitted in a random-effects meta-analysis model. Statistical heterogeneity was quantified using Cochran Q test, tau2, and I2 statistics. Additional analysis conducted includes Jackknife sensitivity analysis, cumulative meta-analysis, and meta-regression analysis. Results: Out of 553 studies retrieved, 25 studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Almost all studies were conducted on mothers with newborn less than 23 months. Maternal educational status (OR = 1.82; p < 0.001; 95% CI = 1.35 - 2.45; I2 = 84.96%), paternal educational status (OR = 2.72; p = 0.001, 95% CI = 1.49 - 4.97 I2 = 62.50%), income (OR = 1.16; p = 0.002; 95% CI = 1.05 - 1.27; I2 = 0.00%), marital status (OR = 1.39; p = 0.001; 95% CI = 1.14 - 1.69; I2 = 9.17%) and parity (OR = 1.39; p = 0.01; 95% CI = 1.07 - 1.81; I2 = 74.43%) were found to be significantly associated with TIBF. We also observed a direct dose-response relationship of TIBF with educational status and income. Conclusions: Proximal and distal factors significantly predicting TIBF practice in Ethiopia, which needs integrated intervention by health professionals and healthcare policymakers. Health education, counselling and peer education targeting parents at antenatal and postnatal periods are needed. It is also relevant to improve the economic power of women and promote gender equality.","Habtewold, T. D.; Mohammed, S. H.; Endalamaw, A.; Mulugeta, H.; Dessie, G.; Berhe, D. F.; Birhanu, M.

14,"Transfer of Statistical Innovations of the 1990s-2000s in Oncology to the Biomedical Literature","Introduction: Innovations in the fields of clinical studies require time to generate and disseminate new knowledge. We aimed to specifically explore lag times between the introduction and widespread use of innovative statistical methods in oncology using the competing risks and phase I model-based clinical trials settings as examples. Methods: First, we defined a set of closed articles for each setting based on two princeps papers (Gray, Annals of Statistics 1998 for the competing risks setting and O Quigley et al., Biometrics 1990 for the phase I setting). Secondly, we retrieved from the web of science all citations of the papers included in these sets. Each journal was classified as applied, semi-applied or methodological. Results: A total of 6,727 citations for the competing risks setting and 2,639 citations for the phase I setting were found. Time to reach 25 citations was 6.2 years for the paper from Gray and 4.5 years for the Fine and Gray paper, while it ranged from 3.4 years up to at least 20.1 years and not reached for 6 papers from the competing risks setting. The vast majority (91%) of the citing papers for the competing risks setting originated from applied journals. In contrast, less than half (44%) of the citing papers for the phase I setting were published in applied journals. Conclusion: Statistical innovations in the competing risks setting have been widely diffused in the medical literature unlike the model-based designs for phase I trials, which are still seldom used 30 years after publication.","Alexandre Vivot; Vincent Levy; Sylvie Chevret",20190625,"Oncology","10.1101/19000638",1,"Alexandre Vivot","APHP","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000638v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000638v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"Data used in this study are publicly available data.

15,"Histopathologist Features Predictive of Diagnostic Concordance at Expert Level Amongst a Large International Sample of Pathologists Diagnosing Barrett's Dysplasia Using Digital Pathology","Objective: Guidelines recommend expert pathology review of Barrett's oesophagus (BO) biopsies that reveal dysplasia, but there are no evidence-based standards to corroborate expert reviewer status. We investigated BO concordance rates and pathologist features predictive of diagnostic discordance amongst a large international cohort of gastrointestinal pathologists to develop a quantitative model of BO expert review. Design: Pathologists (n=55) from over 20 countries assessed 55 digitised BO biopsies from across the diagnostic spectrum, before and after viewing matched p53 immunohistochemistry. Extensive demographic and clinical experience data were obtained via online questionnaire. We calculated discordance rates and applied multivariate regression analyses to identify predictors of concordance. Results: We recorded over 6,000 individual case diagnoses. Of 2,805 H&E diagnoses, we found excellent concordance (>70%) for non-dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus (NDBO) and high-grade dysplasia (HGD), and intermediate concordance for low-grade dysplasia (LGD, 42%) and indefinite for dysplasia (IND, 23%). Major diagnostic errors (i.e. NDBO overinterpreted as LGD/HGD or vice versa) were found in 248 diagnoses (8.8%), which reduced to 8.3% after viewing p53 labelled slides. At least 5 years of professional experience was protective against major diagnostic error for H&E slide review (OR 0.48, 95%CI 0.31-0.74). Working in a district general hospital was associated with increased odds of major diagnostic error (OR 1.76, 95%CI 1.15-2.69), however this was neutralised when pathologists viewed p53 labelled slides, suggesting a beneficial impact of p53 immunohistochemistry for this group. Conclusion: We have developed an evidence-based quantitative model of BO histopathology diagnosis at expert consensus level that will inform guideline development.","Myrtle J Van Der Wel; Helen G Coleman; Jacques Jghm Bergman; Marnix Jansen; Sybren L Meijer",20190625,"Oncology","10.1101/19000174",1,"Marnix Jansen","UCL Cancer Institute","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000174v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000174v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"All primary data will be made available upon request",2
17,"Pain Reduction by Inducing Sensory-Motor Adaptation in Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS PRISMA): Protocol for a Double-blind Randomized Controlled Trial","Background: Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) presents as chronic, continuous pain and sensory, autonomic, and motor abnormalities affecting one or more extremities. People with CRPS can also show changes in their perception of and attention to the affected body part and sensory information in the affected side of space. Prism Adaptation (PA) is a behavioural intervention targeted at reducing attention deficits in post-stroke hemispatial neglect. PA also appears to reduce pain and other CRPS symptoms; however, these therapeutic effects have been demonstrated only in small unblinded studies. This paper describes the protocol for an ongoing double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial that will evaluate the efficacy of PA treatment for CRPS. The secondary aims of the study are to examine the relationships between neuropsychological changes (such as spatial attention, space and body representation, and motor spatial performance) and clinical manifestations of CRPS, as well as symptom improvement. Methods: Forty-two participants with upper-limb CRPS type I will undergo two weeks of twice-daily PA treatment or sham treatment. The primary outcome measures are current pain intensity and CRPS severity score, measured immediately before and after the treatment period. Secondary outcome measures include the results of self-report questionnaires about pain, movement, symptoms interference, and body representation; clinical assessments of sensory, motor, and autonomic functions; and computer-based psychophysical tests of neuropsychological functions. Data are collected in four research visits: four weeks and one day before treatment, and one day and four weeks after the end of treatment. Additional follow-up through postal questionnaires is conducted three and six months post-treatment. Discussion: It is hypothesised that participants undergoing PA treatment, compared to those receiving sham treatment, will show greater reduction in pain and CRPS severity score, and improvements on other clinical and neuropsychological measures. Also, more pronounced neuropsychological symptoms are predicted to correlate with more severe clinical CRPS symptoms. This study will provide the first randomized double-blind evaluation of the therapeutic effects of PA that could be implemented as a rehabilitation method for CRPS, and will contribute to the understanding of how neuropsychological changes in body representation and attention pertain to the manifestation and treatment of CRPS.","Halicka, M.; Vitterso, A.

21,"Gait differences in patients with multiple sclerosis who have low and high levels of disability.","Background: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) often results in gait impairment and disability. Objective: To investigate differences in spatiotemporal gait characteristics of people with MS who have low versus high levels of disability. Between trial and inter-limb consistency and the association of gait variables with level of disability were also investigated. Methods: Participants with MS who had either low-disability [n=7; 3 females; EDSS mean: 2.7{+/-}0.5, range 2.0-4.5; BMI=26.9{+/-}6.6] or high-disability [n=11; 6 females; EDSS mean: 2.7{+/-}0.5, range 6.0-6.5; BMI=27.8{+/-}1.5) performed 2 trials of self-selected walking on an instrumented walkway. Differences in group, limb, and group by limb interactions were assessed using analysis of variance, independent-measures t-tests, and Cohen's d effect sizes (ES). Between-trial consistency of gait were assessed with intra-class correlation coefficients (2, k). Results: Participants in the high disability group had increased step time (ES=0.8), cycle time (ES=0.8), and ambulation time (ES=1.2) while taking shorter strides (ES=0.9) and more steps at a slower rate (ES=1.1). The high disability group demonstrated less between-trial consistency for 69% of gait variables when compared to the low disability group. Conclusion: People with MS who have high levels of disability walk differently and with less consistency than those with lower levels of disability.

22,"Metabolomics in juvenile-onset SLE: identifying new biomarkers to predict cardiovascular risk","BACKGROUND: Juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE) is an autoimmune disorder characterised by immune dysregulation, chronic inflammation and increased cardiovascular risk (CVR). Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in JSLE patients not attributable to disease flares. However, it is not possible to predict those patients at greatest risk using traditional CVR factors. METHODSerum metabolomic analysis was performed using a nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-platform in 31 JSLE patients. Data was analysed using cluster, linear regression and receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results were validated in a second cohort of 31 JSLE patients and using data from a cohort of adult-onset SLE patients with known pre-clinical atherosclerotic plaque. RESULTS: Unbiased hierarchical clustering of metabolomic data identified three patient groups. Group-1 had decreased atheroprotective high density lipoproteins (HDL) and increased atherogenic very low and low density lipoproteins (VLDL/LDL); Group-2 had elevated HDL but reduced VLDL/LDL; and Group-3 had low HDL/VLDL/LDL levels. Notably, apolipoprotein(Apo)B1:ApoA1 ratio, a known CVR marker in adult cohorts, was elevated in Group-1 JSLE patients compared to Groups-2/3. The metabolomic signature was validated in a second JSLE cohort and compared with lipid biomarkers previously associated with pre-clinical atherosclerotic plaque in adult SLE patients. Linear regression analysis accounting for demographics, treatment, disease activity, lupus serological markers and body mass index confirmed that a unique metabolomic profile could differentiate between JSLE patients at high and low CVR. CONCLUSIONS: Patient stratification using ApoB:ApoA1 ratio and lipoprotein signatures could facilitate tailored lipid modification therapies and/or diet/lifestyle interventions to combat increased CVR in JSLE.","George A Robinson; Leda Coelewij; Ania Radziszewska; Chris Wincup; Hannah Peckham; Kirsty Waddington; David A Isenberg; Yiannis Ioannou; Coziana Ciurtin; Ines Pineda-Torra; Elizabeth C Jury",20190625,"Rheumatology","10.1101/19000356",1,"Elizabeth C Jury","University College London","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000356v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000356v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"Metabolomic and logistic regression data is listed in the supplemental data.",5
23,"Electrocardiographic Changes After Completion of a Triathlon","Objectives: Given the increasing popularity of long-distance triathlon events amongst amateur athlete and the difficulty for emergency physician to address cardiovascular complaints in the context of exercise, this study aims to: -Identify the prevalence of electrocardiographic abnormalities before and after a long distance triathlon in a cohort of participants using the Seattle criteria. -Identify the acute changes that occur on their ECGs at the finish line of a long-distance triathlon. Methods: This prospective observational study examines the prevalence of selected standard 12-lead ECG findings, the Seattle criteria, in asymptomatic athletes before and after the completion of a long-distance triathlon. Results: Of 99 ECGs obtained prior to the race, 28 were abnormal, for a pre-race prevalence of 28.3% (95% CI (20.4, 37.8)). Of the 72 ECGs post-race, 12 were abnormal, for a post-race prevalence of 16.7% (95% CI (9.8, 26.9)). We did not observe any athletes with marked repolarization abnormalities. Common findings were increased QRS voltage significant for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (24 (24.2%) pre-race, 10 (14.1%) post-race), early repolarization (21 (21.2%) pre-race, 19 (26.8%) post-race) and incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB) (8 (8.1%) pre-race, 11 (15.5%) post-race). McNemar test showed no agreement between the ECG pre and post results (Chi-square =6.54, p = 0.01), suggesting a possible effect of the race on ECG findings. We observed a trend to normalization of athletes ECGs with acute exercise. Conclusion: Long-distance endurance exercise might acutely affect the ECGs findings in asymptomatic athletes and abnormal ECG findings were common in our cohort of athletes. Physicians providing care to long-distance athletes should interpret ECGs in this population prudently.","Caroline Hosatte-Ducassy; Jose Correa; Francois Lalonde; Rohit Mohindra; Michael Chetrit; Gregory Marton; Audrey Marcotte; Francois Tournoux; Eileen Bridges",20190625,"Sports Medicine","10.1101/19000687",1,"Caroline Hosatte-Ducassy","McGill University, Department of Emergency Medicine","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000687v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000687v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd","10.1002/tsm2.134","Deanonymized datas available upon request.",2
25,"Disease overarching mechanisms that explain and predict outcome of patients with high cardiovascular risk: rationale and design of the Berlin Long-term Observation of Vascular Events (BeLOVE) study","Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of premature death worldwide. Effective and individualized treatment requires exact knowledge about both risk factors and risk estimation. Most evidence for risk prediction currently comes from population-based studies on first incident cardiovascular events. In contrast, little is known about the relevance of risk factors for the outcome of patients with established CVD or those who are at high risk of CVD, including patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition, most studies focus on individual diseases, whereas less is known about disease overarching risk factors and cross-over risk. Aim: The aim of BeLOVE is to improve short- and long-term prediction and mechanistic understanding of cardiovascular disease progression and outcomes in very high-risk patients, both in the acute as well as in the chronic phase, in order to provide the basis for improved, individualized management. Study design: BeLOVE is an observational prospective cohort study of patients of both sexes aged >18 in selected Berlin hospitals, who have a high risk of future cardiovascular events, including patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), acute stroke (AS), acute heart failure (AHF), acute kidney injury (AKI) or type 2 diabetes with manifest target-organ damage. BeLOVE includes 2 subcohorts: The acute subcohort includes 6500 patients with ACS, AS, AHF, or AKI within 2-8 days after their qualifying event, who undergo a structured interview about medical history as well as blood sample collection. The chronic subcohort includes 6000 patients with ACS, AS, AHF, or AKI 90 days after event, and patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and target-organ damage. These patients undergo a 6-8 hour deep phenotyping program, including detailed clinical phenotyping from a cardiological, neurological and metabolic perspective, questionnaires including patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)as well as magnetic resonance imaging. Several biological samples are collected (i.e. blood, urine, saliva, stool) with blood samples collected in a fasting state, as well as after a metabolic challenge (either nutritional or cardiopulmonary exercise stress test). Ascertainment of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) will be performed in all patients using a combination of active and passive follow up procedures, such as on-site visits (if applicable), telephone interviews, review of medical charts, and links to local health authorities. Additional phenotyping visits are planned at 2, 5 and 10 years after inclusion into the chronic subcohort. Future perspective: BeLOVE provides a unique opportunity to study both the short- and long-term disease course of patients at high cardiovascular risk through innovative and extensive deep phenotyping. Moreover, the unique study design provides opportunities for acute and post-acute inclusion and allows us to derive two non-nested yet overlapping sub-cohorts, tailored for upcoming research questions. Thereby, we aim to study disease overarching research questions, to understand crossover risk, and to find similarities and differences between clinical phenotypes of patients at high cardiovascular risk.","Siegerink, B.; Weber, J.; Ahmadi, M.; Eckardt, K.-U.; Edelmann, F.; Endres, M.; Gerhardt, H.; Haubold, K.; Hu¨bner, N.; Landmesser, U.; Leistner, D.; Mai, K.; Mu¨ller, D.

26,"Nutritional Supplementation during Pulmonary Rehabilitation in COPD: A Systematic Review","Uptake of nutritional supplementation during pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been limited by an absence of rigorous evidence-based studies supporting use. Our objective were to report and summarise the current evidence supporting use of nutritional supplementation to improve outcomes during pulmonary rehabilitation in stable COPD patients. A systematic search was conducted up to May 7th, 2019 (registration number CRD42018089142). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used. Six databases were included: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online or MEDLARS Online (Medline), Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Excerpta Medica dataBASE (Embase), Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Web of Science. This systematic search generated 580 initial matches, of which 24 studies (1035 COPD participants) met the pre-specified criteria and were included. Our analysis does not confirm an impact of nutritional supplementation during PR, but studies, supplements and PR programmes were heterogeneous in nature. There is currently insufficient evidence on the effect of nutritional supplementation on improving outcomes during PR in patients with COPD. Therefore, controversy remains and further research is needed.","Abdulelah Aldhahir; John Hurst; Swapna Mandal; Ahmed Alrajeh; Yousef Aldabayan; Jaber Alqahtani; Salifu Drammeh; Vanitha Subbu",20190628,"Nutrition","10.1101/19000786",1,"Abdulelah Aldhahir","University College London","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000786v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000786v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd","10.1177/1479973120904953","Not applicable",0
27,"Comparative analysis of functional assay evidence use by ClinGen Variant Curation Expert Panels","Background The 2015 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) guidelines for clinical sequence variant interpretation state that well-established functional studies can be used as evidence in variant classification. These guidelines articulated key attributes of functional data, including that assays should reflect the biological environment and be analytically sound; however, details of how to evaluate these attributes were left to expert judgment. The Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) designates Variant Curation Expert Panels (VCEPs) in specific disease areas to make gene-centric specifications to the ACMG/AMP guidelines, including more specific definitions of appropriate functional assays. We set out to evaluate the existing VCEP guidelines for functional assays. Methods We evaluated the functional criteria (PS3/BS3) of six VCEPs (CDH1, Hearing Loss, Inherited Cardiomyopathy-MYH7, PAH, PTEN, RASopathy). We then established criteria for evaluating functional studies based on disease mechanism, general class of assay, and the characteristics of specific assay instances described in primary literature. Using these criteria, we extensively curated assay instances cited by each VCEP in their pilot variant classification to analyze VCEP recommendations and their use in the interpretation of functional studies. Results Unsurprisingly, our analysis highlighted the breadth of VCEP-approved assays, reflecting the diversity of disease mechanisms among VCEPs. We also noted substantial variability between VCEPs in the method used to select these assays and in the approach used to specify strength modifications, as well as differences in suggested validation parameters. Importantly, we observed discrepancies between the parameters VCEPs specified as required for approved assay instances and the fulfillment of these requirements in the individual assays cited in pilot variant interpretation. Conclusions Interpretation of the intricacies of functional assays often requires expert-level knowledge of the gene and disease and current VCEP recommendations for functional assay evidence are a useful tool to improve the accessibility of functional data. However, our analysis suggests that further guidance is needed to standardize this process and ensure consistency in the application of functional evidence.","Dona M. Kanavy; Shannon M.

28,"Association of puberty timing with Type 2 diabetes: Systematic review and meta-analysis","OBJECTIVE: We aimed to systematically review published evidence on the association between puberty timing and Type 2 diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance (T2D/IGT), with and without adjustment for adiposity, and to estimate its potential contribution to the burden of T2D. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We searched PubMed, Medline and Embase databases for publications until February 2019 on the timing of any secondary sexual characteristic in boys or girls in relation to T2D/IGT. Inverse-weighted random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool reported estimates and meta-regression to explore sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Twenty eight observational studies were identified. All assessed age at menarche (AAM) in women (combined N=1,228,306); only one study additionally included men. In models without adjustment for adult adiposity, T2D/IGT risk was higher per year earlier AAM (relative risk (RR)=0.91, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.89-0.93, 11 estimates, n=833,529, I2=85.4%) and for early versus later menarche (RR=1.41, 95% CI=1.28-1.55, 23 estimates, n=1,185,444, I2=87.8%). Associations were weaker but still evident in models adjusted for adiposity (AAM: RR=0.97 per year, 95% CI=0.95-0.98, 12 estimates, n=852,268, I2=51.8%; early menarche: RR=1.19, 95% CI=1.11-1.28, 21 estimates, n=890,583, I2=68.1%). Associations were stronger among Caucasians than Asians, and in populations with earlier average AAM. The estimated population attributable risk of T2D in UK Caucasians due to early menarche, unadjusted and adjusted for adiposity, was 12.6% (95% CI=11.0-14.3) and 5.1% (95% CI=3.6-6.7), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of T2D in women is attributable to early menarche timing. This will increase in light of global secular trends towards earlier puberty timing.","Tuck Seng Cheng; Felix R. Day; Rajalakshmi Lakshman; Ken K.

29,"Epigenetic prediction of major depressive disorder","Objective: DNA methylation (DNAm) is associated with environmental risk factors for major depressive disorder (MDD) but has not yet been tested for its ability to discriminate individuals with MDD from unaffected individuals. Methods: Using penalized regression based on genome-wide CpG methylation, we trained a DNAm risk score of MDD (DNAm-RS) in 1,223 cases and 1,824 controls and tested in a second independent sample of 363 prevalent cases and 1,417 controls. Using DNA from 1,607 unaffected individuals, we tested whether DNAm-RS could discriminate the 190 incident cases of lifetime MDD from the 1,417 individuals who remained unaffected at follow-up. Results: A weighted linear combination of 196 CpG sites were derived from the training sample to form a DNAm-RS. The DNAm-RS explained 1.75% of the variance in MDD risk in an independent case-control sample and significantly predicted future incident episodes of MDD at follow up (R2=0.52%). DNAm-RS and MDD polygenic risk scores together additively explained 3.99% of the variance in prevalent MDD. The DNAm-RS was also significantly associated with lifestyle factors associated with MDD, including smoking status ({beta}=0.440, p=<2x10-16) and alcohol use ({beta}=0.092, p=9.85x10-5). The DNAm-RS remained significantly associated with MDD after adjustment for these environmental factors (independent association: {beta}=0.338, p=1.17x10-7 association post-adjustment: {beta}=0.081, p=0.0006). Conclusions: A novel risk score of MDD based on DNAm data significantly discriminated MDD cases from controls in an independent dataset, and controls who would subsequently develop MDD from those who remained unaffected. DNAm-RS captured the effects of exposure to key lifestyle risk factors for MDD, revealing a potential role in risk stratification.","Miruna C Barbu; Rosie M Walker; David M Howard; Kathryn L Evans; Heather C Whalley; David J Porteous; Stewart W Morris; Ian J Deary; Riccardo E Marioni; Toni-Kim Clarke; Andrew M Mcintosh",20190628,"Psychiatry And Clinical Psychology","10.1101/19001123",1,"Andrew M Mcintosh","University of Edinburgh","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001123v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001123v1.full.pdf","cc_by",NA,"The predictor detailed in the manuscript is available in the supplementary Excel file.

30,"Forecasting the impact of population ageing on tuberculosis incidence","Background: Tuberculosis (TB) disease reactivates from distant latent infection or recent (re)infection. Progression risks increase with age. Across the World Health Organisation Western Pacific region, many populations are ageing and have the highest per capita TB incidence rates in older age groups. However, methods for analysing age-specific TB incidence and forecasting epidemic trends while accounting for demographic change remain limited. Methods: We applied the Lee-Carter models, which were originally developed for mortality modelling, to model the temporal trends in age-specific TB incidence data from 2005 to 2018 in Taiwan. Females and males were modelled separately. We combined our demographic forecasts, and age-specific TB incidence forecasts to project TB incidence until 2035. We compared TB incidence projections with demography fixed in 2018 to projections accounting for demographic change. Results: Our models quantified increasing incidence rates with age and declining temporal trends. By 2035, the forecast suggests that the TB incidence rate in Taiwan will decrease by 54% (95% Prediction Interval (PI): 45%-59%) compared to 2015, while most age-specific incidence rates will reduce by more than 60%. In 2035, adults aged 65 and above will make up 78% of incident TB cases. Forecast TB incidence in 2035 accounting for demographic change will be 39% (95% PI: 36%-42%) higher than without population ageing. Conclusions: Age-specific incidence forecasts coupled with demographic forecasts can inform the impact of population ageing on TB epidemics. The TB control programme in Taiwan should develop plans specific to older age groups and their care needs.","Chu-Chang Ku; Peter J Dodd",20190628,"Epidemiology","10.1101/19001115",1,"Chu-Chang Ku","School of Health and Related Research, University of Sheffield","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001115v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001115v1.full.pdf","cc_by","10.1371/journal.pone.0222937","All analysis code and formatted data are available from the GitHub repository [https://github.com/TimeWz667/AgeingTB] https://github.com/TimeWz667/AgeingTB",6

PCR plays an important part in surveillance. Methods Children suspected to have yaws were enrolled. From the largest lesion paired swabs were collected; one into transport medium and one as a dry swab. In children with multiple lesions we collected additional swabs from up to four subsequent lesions. Swabs in transport medium were maintained in a cold-chain whilst dry swabs were stored at ambient temperature. Swabs were tested by PCR for Treponema pallidum and Haemophilus ducreyi. Results Of 55 individuals, 10 (18%) had at least 1 positive PCR for T. pallidum and 12 (22%) had at least 1 positive result for H. ducreyi. Concordance was 100% between swabs in transport medium and dry swabs. One patient had PCR-confirmed yaws on the swab of a third lesion when both the first and second lesions were PCR-negative. Discussion Storing swabs in transport medium and transporting in a cold chain did not improve yield, however detection of T. pallidum is increased by swabbing additional lesions. As the target for yaws is eradication approaches to sample collection need revisiting to ensure cases are not missed.","Munson, M.; Cresswell, B.; Kondobala, K.; Gainwu, B.; Lomotey, R.

36,"The prevalence of scabies, pyoderma and other communicable dermatoses in the Bijagos Archipelago, Guinea-Bissau","Background: Skin diseases represent a significant public health problem in most low and middle income settings. Nevertheless, there is a relative paucity of high-quality epidemiological data on the prevalence of these conditions. Materials/methods: We conducted two cross-sectional population-based skin-surveys of children (6 months to 9 years old) in the Bijagos Archipelago of Guinea-Bissau during the dry season (February-March 2018) and the wet season (June-July 2018). Following a period of training, a nurse performed a standardised examination for communicable dermatoses for each participant. We calculated the prevalence of each skin condition and investigated demographic associations. Results: 1062 children were enrolled in the dry season survey of whom 318 (29.9%) had at least one skin diseases. The most common diagnosis was tinea capitis (154/1062, 14.5% - 95% CI 12.5-16.8%) followed by tinea corporis (84/1062, 7.9% - 95% CI 6.4-9.7%), pyoderma (82/1062, 7.7% - 95% CI 6.2-9.5%) and scabies (56/1062. 5.2% - 95%CI 4.0 - 6.8%). 320 children were enrolled in the wet season survey of whom 121 (37.8%) had at least one skin problem. Tinea capitis remained the most common diagnosis (79/320, 24.7% - 95% CI 20.1 - 29.9%), followed by pyoderma (38/320, 11.9% - 95% CI 8.6-16.1%), tinea corporis (23/320, 7.2% - 95% 4.7 - 10.7%) and scabies (6/320, 1.9% - 95% CI 0.8-4.2%). Conclusions: Our study, which utilised robust population-based cluster random sampling methodology, demonstrates the substantial disease burden caused by common communicable dermatoses in this setting. Given these findings, there is a need to consider common dermatoses as part of Universal Health Coverage to deliver skin-health for all.","Marks, M.; Sammut, T.; Cabral, M. G.; Da Silva, E.

37,"Current characteristics and outcomes of Cytomegalovirus Reactivation in kidney transplant seropositive recipients in the era of prophylaxis treatment. Lesson from single Moroccan center experience.","Despite the use of antiviral prophylaxis, the active cytomegalovirus (CMV) replication is still occurred in the seropositive kidney recipients. The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of CMV reactivation and potential risk factors associated with CMV disease. Data of sixty kidney transplant recipients who had received CMV prophylaxis were obtained between 2013 and 2017. Quantitative nucleic acid amplification testing for CMV viraemia was assessed using Abbott RealTime Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Among the seropositive recipients, cumulative incidence for reactivation was 63%. In patients with quantitative viraemia, the time of active replication was significantly lower compared to those with detectable viraemia (141.5, SD:96.9 vs 294.1, SD: 112.6 days, P inferior to 0.001). During prophylactic treatment, 46.7% of patients with quantifiable viraemia had experienced active replication and none among patients with detectable viraemia (P= 0.017). Importantly, symptomatic reactivation was significantly observed in the younger patients with higher peak viraemia compared to those with symptoms free (28.8, SD:5.12 vs. 38.1, SD: 12.34 years, P= 0.007) and 3.8, SD: 1.59 vs. 2.4, SD: 0. 79 log10IU/ml, P = 0.003, respectively). Furthermore, the median duration of viraemia (21.2, vs. 13.4 days, P= 0.028) and period of CMV therapy (24.3 vs 12.3 days, P inferior to 0.001) were significantly longer for this group. In addition, intercurrent infections (75% vs. 23%, P = 0.028 ) and acute rejection (50 % vs 0%, P = 0.003) were significantly more frequent in symptomatic reactivation group. In addition, peak viral load was a potential risk factor for development of symptomatic reactivation with odds ratio 3.39, 95%CI=1.21-9.53, P = 0.02). In conclusion, CMV reactivation remains serious problem for seropositive recipients who were expected to be on antiviral prophylaxis. Patients with high level of viraemia may be at an increased risk of progression to CMV disease and adverse outcomes.","Rezzouk, B.; Bouattar, T.; Belkadi, B.; Razine, R.; Bayahia, R.; Ouzeddoun, N.; Benamar, L.; Rhou, H.; Bouihat, N.; Ibrahimi, A.; Seffar, M.; Kabbaj, H.",20190628,"Infectious Diseases","10.1101/19001008",1,"Bouchra Rezzouk","Laboratory of Microbiology and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, University Mohammed V, Rabat, Morocco.","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001008v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001008v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"All relevant data are within the manuscript.",5
39,"Medication errors during simulated paediatric resuscitations: a prospective, observational human reliability analysis","Introduction: Medication errors during paediatric resuscitation are thought to be common. However, there is little evidence about the individual process steps that contribute to such medication errors in this context. Objectives: To describe the incidence, nature and severity of medication errors in simulated paediatric resuscitations, and to employ human reliability analysis to understand the contributory role of individual process step discrepancies to these errors. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study of simulated resuscitations subject to video micro-analysis, identification of medication errors, severity assessment and human reliability analysis in a large English teaching hospital. Fifteen resuscitation teams of two doctors and two nurses each conducted one of two simulated paediatric resuscitation scenarios. Results: At least one medication error was observed in every simulated case, and a large magnitude or clinically significant error in 11 of 15 cases. Medication errors were observed in 29% of 180 simulated medication administrations, 40% of which considered to be moderate or severe. These errors were the result of 884 observed discrepancies at a number of steps in the drug ordering, preparation and administration stages of medication use, 8% of which made a major contribution to a resultant medication error. Most errors were introduced by discrepancies during drug preparation and administration. Conclusions: Medication errors were common with a considerable proportion likely to result in patient harm. There is an urgent need to optimise existing systems and to commission research into new approaches to increase the reliability of human interactions during administration of medication in the paediatric emergency setting.","Appelbaum, N.; Clarke, J.; Feather, C.; Dean Franklin, B.; Sinha, R.; Pratt, P.; Maconochie, I.; Darzi, A.",20190802,"Pediatrics","10.1101/19001016",2,"Calandra Feather","NIHR-Imperial Patient Safety Translational Research Centre, Imperial College London","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001016v2?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001016v2.full.pdf","cc_by","10.1136/bmjopen-2019-032686","All data relevant to the study are included in the article or uploaded as supplementary information",5
41,"Characteristics, service use and mortality of clusters of multimorbid patients in England: a population-based study","Background Multimorbidity is one of the principal challenges facing health systems worldwide. To help understand the changes to services and policies that are required to deliver better care, we used a novel approach to investigate which diseases co-occur and how combinations are associated with mortality and service use. Methods Linked primary and secondary care electronic health records contributed by 382 general practices in England to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) were used. The study included a representative set of multimorbid adults (18 years old or more) with two or more long-term conditions (N=113,211). A random set of 80% of the multimorbid patients (N=90,571) were stratified by age and clustered using latent class analysis. Consistency between obtained disease profiles, classification quality and associations with demographic characteristics and primary outcomes (hospitalisation, polypharmacy and mortality) was validated in the remaining 20% of multimorbid patients (N=22,640). Findings We identified twenty patient clusters across four age strata. The clusters with the highest mortality comprised psychoactive substance and alcohol misuse (aged 18-64), coronary heart disease, depression and pain (aged 65-84) and coronary heart disease, heart failure and atrial fibrillation (aged 85+). The clusters with the highest service use coincided with those with highest mortality for people aged over 65. For people aged 18-64, the cluster with the highest service use comprised depression, anxiety and pain. The majority of 85+ year olds multimorbid patients belonged to the cluster with the lowest service use and mortality for that age range. Pain featured in thirteen clusters. Interpretation This work has highlighted patterns of multimorbidity that have implications for health services. These include the importance of psychoactive substance and alcohol misuse in people under the age of 65; of co-morbid depression and coronary heart disease in people aged 65-84, and of cardiovascular disease in people aged 85+.","Zhu, Y.; Edwards, D.; Mant, J.; Payne, R.

42,"Big Five Personality Traits Influence Tinnitus Improvement Over Time","Previous studies investigating the relation between personality and tinnitus distress showed that high neuroticism and low extraversion scores are related to higher tinnitus distress measured by the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) and the Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ). However, little is known about the role of personality on tinnitus distress over time. We collected the THI, TQ and Big Five Factor Index 2 of 388 patients who visited the Tinnitus Center Regensburg between 2012 and 2017, and filled in a survey with the same questionnaires in 2018. We used personality traits and facets to predict tinnitus distress cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Neuroticism and extraversion were significant predictors of THI and TQ scores in cross-sectional linear regression setups, and could explain up to 40% of the variance. However, the linear regressions could explain only little variance of both THI and TQ longitudinally. We clustered patients in three groups based in the difference THI and TQ between the two assessments: clinically improved, clinically stable and clinically worsened. The patients in the clinically improved and clinically stable groups scored statistically significantly lower in neuroticism and higher in extraversion than patients in the group clinically worsened. We observed a similar trend among patients who tried at least one clinical treatment. Our results suggest that personality traits, namely neuroticism and extraversion, are relevant markers of tinnitus distress over time and could be used to statistically distinguish patient groups with clinically relevant changes of tinnitus distress. These markers could inform both treatment responses from clinical studies and future choices on more efficient individual tinnitus treatments.","Simoes, J.

43,"Cost-Sensitive Machine Learning Classification for Mass Tuberculosis Screening","Active screening for Tuberculosis (TB) is needed to optimize detection and treatment. However, current algorithms for verbal screening perform poorly, causing misclassification that leads to missed cases and unnecessary and costly laboratory tests for false positives. We investigated the role of machine learning to improve the predefined one-size-fits-all algorithm used for scoring the verbal screening questionnaire. We present a cost-sensitive machine learning classification for mass tuberculosis screening. We compared score-based classification defined by clinicians to machine learning classification such as SVM-RBF, logistic regression, and XGBoost. We restricted our analyses to data from adults, the population most affected by TB, and investigated the difference between untuned and unweighted classifiers to the cost-sensitive ones. Predictions were compared with the corresponding GeneXpert MTB/Rif results. After adjusting the weight of the positive class to 40 for XGBoost, we achieved 96.64% sensitivity and 35.06% specificity. As such, sensitivity of our identifier increased by 1.26% while specificity increased by 13.19% in absolute value compared to the traditional score-based method defined by our clinicians. Our approach further demonstrated that only 2000 data points were sufficient to enable the model to converge. Our results indicate that even with limited data we can actually devise a better method to identify TB suspects from verbal screening. This approach may be a stepping stone towards more effective TB case identification, especially in primary health centres, and foster better detection and control of TB.","Septiandri, A.

We evaluated GISTelemed accordingly to the guidelines published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and input provided by a questionnaire customized according to AdEQUATE (questionnAire for Evaluation of QUAlity in TElemedicine systems). 39 healthcare professionals from 13 municipalities participated in the evaluation. We analyzed data from questionnaires using descriptive statistics, being Lernability and Comfort the characteristics that received the best evaluation. Quantitative evaluation based upon leprosis cases detected through tele-dermatology showed a sensitivity and PPV of respectively 77.2% and 95.3%. 22.8% of the cases detected were un-notified cases. Results from our case study show a good evaluation regarding the perceived software quality. We conclude that the integration of spatial epidemiology tools to the STT/SC system, besides enabling visualization of data in maps, allowed users to analyze the evolution of morbidities and their co-occurrences.","Von Wangenheim, A.; Savaris, A.; Borgatto, A.

46,"An acute bleomycin inflammatory and fibrotic mouse model of morphea is dependent upon CXCL9 and CXCR3","Morphea, or localized scleroderma, is characterized by an inflammatory phase followed by cutaneous fibrosis, which may lead to disfigurement and/or disability. Previous work from our group showed that the CXCR3 ligands CXCL9 and CXCL10 are highly upregulated in lesional skin of morphea patients. Here, we used an acute inflammatory and fibrotic bleomycin mouse model of morphea to examine the role of the CXCR3 chemokine axis in pathogenesis. We first characterized which cells produce the CXCR3 ligands in the skin using the Reporter of Expression of CXCR3 ligands mouse (REX3). We found that fibroblasts contribute the bulk of CXCL9 and CXCL10, whereas endothelial cells are key dual chemokine producers. Macrophages, which have high MFI of chemokine expression, upregulated CXCL9 production over time, fibroblasts CXCL10 production, and T cells dual chemokine expression. To determine whether bleomycin treatment could directly induce expression of these chemokines, we treated cultured REX3 mouse dermis monolayers in vitro with bleomycin or IFN{gamma} with TNF and found that bleomycin could induce low amounts of CXCL9 directly in fibroblasts, whereas the cytokines were required for optimal CXCL9 and CXCL10 production. To determine whether these chemokines are mechanistically involved in pathogenesis, we induced fibrosis in CXCL9, CXCL10, or CXCR3 deficient mice and found that fibrosis is dependent on CXCL9 and CXCR3. Addition of recombinant CXCL9, but not CXCL10, to cultured mouse fibroblasts induces collagen 1a1 mRNA expression, indicating the chemokine itself can contribute to fibrosis. Taken together, our studies provide evidence that acute intradermal bleomycin administration in mice can model inflammatory morphea, and that CXCL9 and its receptor CXCR3 are mechanistically involved in pathogenesis.","Richmond, J.

47,"SEXUAL BEHAVIOURS AND EXPERIENCE OF SEXUAL COERCION AMONG IN-SCHOOL FEMALE ADOLESCENT IN SOUTHWESTERN NIGERIA","Most people begin their sexual relationship during adolescence and some get involved in risky life threatening behaviors such as unwanted pregnancies, abortions and sexually transmitted infections. This study was therefore designed to understand the patterns of female adolescents sexual behaviours and sexual coercion experience. A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out among 1227 in-school adolescents in the three senatorial district of Osun State, Southwestern Nigeria. Multi-stage sampling technique was used to select the respondents, and data were collected with pre-tested, semi-structured questionnaires. The data collected were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS version 21). Three hundred and thirty seven (27.5%) were sexually exposed with a mean age of sexual initiation of 14 years. Of the 337 that were sexually exposed 153(56.5%) initiated sex early between the ages of 10-15 years, while (4.7%) had uses drugs or take alcohol before sexual intercourse. Findings revealed that of those that were sexually exposed, 122(11%) were forced to have sex, 101(9.1%) played sex willingly, while 29(2.6%) felt threatened and 3(0.3%) were convinced with money. The proportion of the respondent who reported rape and abduction was (2.6%). Finding from this study is consistent with earlier studies conducted in many other Nigerian cities which showed that in-school adolescents to be sexually active. There is the need to step up campaigns to address this noticed lapse in behavior among the students in order to arrest the usual consequences of such risky sexual behavior.","Owolodun, B.

A keyhole access tunnel to the tympanic cavity and targeting the round window was planned based on preoperatively acquired computed tomography image data and robotically drilled to the level of the facial recess. Intraoperative imaging was performed to confirm sufficient distance of the drilling trajectory to relevant anatomy. Robotic drilling continued toward the round window. The cochlear access was manually created by the surgeon. Electrode arrays were inserted through the keyhole tunnel under microscopic supervision via a tympanomeatal flap. All patients were successfully implanted with a cochlear implant. In 9 of 9 patients the robotic drilling was planned and performed to the level of the facial recess. In 3 patients, the procedure was reverted to a conventional approach for safety reasons. No change in facial nerve function compared to baseline measurements was observed. Robotic keyhole access for cochlear implantation is feasible. Further improvements to workflow complexity, duration of surgery, and usability including safety assessments are required to enable wider adoption of the procedure.","Caversaccio, M.; Wimmer, W.; Anso, J.; Mantokoudis, G.; Gerber, N.; Rathgeb, C.; Schneider, D.; Hermann, J.; Wagner, F.; Scheidegger, O.; Huth, M.; Anschuetz, L.; Kompis, M.; Williamson, T.; Bell, B.; Gavaghan, K.; Weber, S.",20190703,"Otolaryngology","10.1101/19000711",1,"Wilhelm Wimmer","Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000711v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000711v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd","10.1371/journal.pone.0220543","All relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information files.",5
50,"Framework for rational donor selection in fecal microbiota transplant clinical trials","Early clinical successes are driving enthusiasm for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), the transfer of healthy gut bacteria through whole stool, as emerging research is linking the microbiome to many different diseases. However, preliminary trials have yielded mixed results and suggest that heterogeneity in donor stool may play a role in patient response. Thus, clinical trials may fail because an ineffective donor was chosen rather than because FMT is not appropriate for the indication. Here, we describe a conceptual framework to guide rational donor selection to increase the likelihood that FMT clinical trials will succeed. We argue that the mechanism by which the microbiome is hypothesized to be associated with a given indication should inform how healthy donors are selected for FMT trials, categorizing these mechanisms into four disease models and presenting associated donor selection strategies. We next walk through examples based on previously published FMT trials and ongoing investigations to illustrate how donor selection might occur in practice. Finally, we show that typical FMT trials are not powered to discover individual taxa mediating patient responses, suggesting that clinicians should develop targeted hypotheses for retrospective analyses and design their clinical trials accordingly. Moving forward, developing and applying novel clinical trial design methodologies like rational donor selection will be necessary to ensure that FMT successfully translates into clinical impact.","Duvallet, C.; Zellmer, C.; Panchal, P.; Budree, S.; Osman, M.; Alm, E.",20190926,"Gastroenterology","10.1101/19000307",2,"Eric Alm","Massachusetts Institute of Technology","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000307v2?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000307v2.full.pdf","cc_by","10.1371/journal.pone.0222881","Code to reproduce all of these analyses and figures can be found at https://github.com/cduvallet/donor-selection/.

53,"LncRNA and predictive model for improving the diagnosis of clinically diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis","Background: Clinically diagnosed pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients lack Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) microbiologic evidence, and misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis often occurs as a consequence. We investigated the potential of lncRNAs and corresponding predictive models to diagnose these patients. Methods: We enrolled 1372 subjects, including clinically diagnosed PTB patients, non-TB disease controls and healthy controls, in three cohorts (Screening, Selection and Validation). Candidate lncRNAs differentially expressed in blood samples of the PTB and healthy control groups were identified by microarray and qRT-PCR in the Screening Cohort. Logistic regression models were developed using lncRNAs and/or electronic health records (EHRs) from clinically diagnosed PTB patients and non-TB disease controls in the Selection Cohort. These models were evaluated by AUC and decision curve analysis, and the optimal model was presented as a Web-based nomogram, which was evaluated in the Validation Cohort. The biological function of lncRNAs was interrogated using ELISA, lactate dehydrogenase release analysis and flow cytometry. Results: Three differentially expressed lncRNAs (ENST00000497872, n333737, n335265) were identified. The optimal model (i.e., nomogram) incorporated these three lncRNAs and six EHR variables (age, hemoglobin, weight loss, low-grade fever, CT calcification and TB-IGRA). The nomogram showed an AUC of 0.89, sensitivity of 0.86 and specificity of 0.82 in the Validation Cohort, which demonstrated better discrimination and clinical net benefit than the EHR model. ENST00000497872 may regulate inflammatory cytokine production, cell death and apoptosis during MTB infection. Conclusion: LncRNAs and the user-friendly nomogram could facilitate the early identification of PTB cases among suspected patients with negative MTB microbiologic evidence.","Hu, X.; Chen, H.; Liao, S.; Bai, H.; Gupta, S.; Zhou, Y.; Zhou, J.; Jiao, L.; Wu, L.; Wang, M.; Chen, X.; Zhou, Y.; Lu, X.; Hu, T.

Methods: Six-echo Dixon imaging was performed in the liver of 89 subjects. The first acquisition variant used acceleration based on SENSE with a total acceleration factor equal to 2.64 (acquisition labeled as SENSE). The second acquisition variant used acceleration based on a combination of CS with SENSE with a total acceleration factor equal to 4 (acquisition labeled as CS+SENSE). Acquisition times were compared between acquisitions and proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and T2*-values were measured and compared separately for each liver segment. Results: Total scan duration was 14.5 sec for the SENSE accelerated image acquisition and 9.3 sec for the CS+SENSE accelerated image acquisition. PDFF and T2* values did not differ significantly between the two acquisitions (paired Mann-Whitney and paired t-test P>0.05 in all cases). CS+SENSE accelerated acquisition showed reduced motion artifacts (1.1%) compared to SENSE acquisition (12.3%). Conclusion: CS+SENSE accelerates liver PDFF and T2*mapping while retaining the same quantitative values as an acquisition using only SENSE and reduces motion artifacts.","Lohoefer, F. K.; Kaissis, G.

55,"Aerobic capacity predicts skeletal but not cardiac muscle damage after a full distance Ironman triathlon - the Iron(wo)man-study","Purpose: This study examines the association between aerobic capacity and biomarkers of skeletal- and cardiac muscle damage among amateur triathletes after a full distance Ironman Methods: Men and women (N=55) were recruited from local sport clubs. One month before an Ironman triathlon, they conducted a 20m shuttle run test to determine aerobic capacity. Blood samples were taken immediately after finishing the triathlon, and analyzed for biomarkers of cardiac- and skeletal muscle damage. Regression models examining the association between aerobic capacity expressed in both relative terms (mLO2*kg-1*min-1) and absolute terms (LO2*min-1) controlled for weight and were fitted. Result: A total of 39 subjects (26% females) had complete data and were included in the analysis. No association between aerobic capacity and cardiac muscle damage but a significant negative association between aerobic capacity and skeletal muscle damage was observed. This association was independent of how aerobic capacity was expressed, although the model with aerobic capacity expressed in absolute terms and controlled for weight resulted in slightly higher r2 values, than when aerobic capacity was expressed in relative terms. Conclusion: A negative association between aerobic capacity and skeletal muscle damage was seen but despite the well-known cardio-protective health effect of high aerobic fitness no such association could be observed in this study.","Danielsson, T.; Carlsson, J.; Ten Siethoff, L.; Ahnesjo, J.; Bergman, P.",20190703,"Sports Medicine","10.1101/19001149",1,"Patrick Bergman","Linnaeus University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001149v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001149v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"Data can be retrieved from the corresponding author at a reasonable request",2
56,"Machine learning to predict early recurrence after oesophageal cancer surgery","Objective: To develop a predictive model for early recurrence after surgery for oesophageal adenocarcinoma using a large multi-national cohort. Summary Background Data: Early cancer recurrence after oesophagectomy is a common problem with an incidence of 20-30% despite the widespread use of neoadjuvant treatment. Quantification of this risk is difficult and existing models perform poorly. Machine learning techniques potentially allow more accurate prognostication and have been applied in this study. Methods: Consecutive patients who underwent oesophagectomy for adenocarcinoma and had neoadjuvant treatment in 6 UK and 1 Dutch oesophago-gastric units were analysed. Using clinical characteristics and post-operative histopathology, models were generated using elastic net regression (ELR) and the machine learning methods random forest (RF) and XG boost (XGB). Finally, a combined (Ensemble) model of these was generated. The relative importance of factors to outcome was calculated as a percentage contribution to the model. Result: In total 812 patients were included. The recurrence rate at less than 1 year was 29.1%. All of the models demonstrated good discrimination. Internally validated AUCs were similar, with the Ensemble model performing best (ELR=0.785, RF=0.789, XGB=0.794, Ensemble=0.806). Performance was similar when using internal-external validation (validation across sites, Ensemble AUC=0.804). In the final model the most important variables were number of positive lymph nodes (25.7%) and vascular invasion (16.9%). Conclusions: The derived model using machine learning approaches and an international dataset provided excellent performance in quantifying the risk of early recurrence after surgery and will be useful in prognostication for clinicians and patients.","Rahman, S.; Walker, R.

58,"Predicting Residual Function in Hemodialysis and Hemodiafiltration : A Population Kinetic, Decision Analytic Approach","In this study, we introduce a novel framework for the estimation of residual renal function (RRF), based on the population compartmental kinetic behavior of Beta 2 Microglobulin (B2M) and its dialytic removal. Using this model, we simulated a large cohort of patients with various levels of RRF receiving either conventional high-flux hemodialysis or on-line hemodiafiltration. These simulations were used to estimate a novel population kinetic (PK) equation for RRF (PK-RRF) that was validated in an external public dataset of real patients. We assessed the performance of the resulting equation(s) against their ability to estimate urea clearance using cross-validation. Our equations derived entirely from computer simulations and advanced statistical modeling, and had extremely high discrimination (AUC 0.808 - 0.909) when applied to a human dataset of measurements of RRF. A clearance-based equation that utilized pre and post dialysis B2M measurements, patient weight, treatment duration and ultrafiltration had higher discrimination than an equation previously derived in humans. Furthermore, the derived equations appeared to have higher clinical usefulness as assessed by Decision Curve Analysis, potentially supporting decisions that for individualizing dialysis frequency in patients with preserved RRF.","Achakzai, M.; Argyropoulos, C.; Roumelioti, M. - E.",20190709,"Nephrology","10.1101/19001222",2,"Christos Argyropoulos","Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Nephrology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001222v2?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001222v2.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd","10.3390/jcm8122080","All data and software code used in this paper are available from bitbucket https://bitbucket.org/chrisarg/pk-rrf/src/master/",6
59,"The impact of involving young children in improving the understanding of a new eye test","Background. Although considered important, the involvement of young children in research is rare and its impact has never been measured. We aim to provide a good practice example of involvement of young children in the development of a tablet-based 3D eye test or stereotest, ASTEROID. We focus on improving understanding of test instructions. Methods. After a pre-measure of understanding was taken, we explored issues with the test instructions in patient and public involvement (PPI) sessions. Feedback was collected via observations, rating scales and children's comments. An interdisciplinary panel reviewed the feedback and decided on the implementation. Subsequently, a post-measure was collected. In Study 1, 650 children (2-11.8 years old) took part in the pre-measure, 111 children (1-12 years old) in the PPI sessions, and 52 children (4-6 years old) in the post-measure which also served as a pre-measure for Study 2. PPI sessions for Study 2 attracted 122 children (1-12 years old) and adults. 53 people (2-39 years old) participated in the post-measure of Study 2. Results. Following feedback in Study 1, we added a frame cue and included a shuffle animation. This increased the percentage of correct practice trials from 76% to 97% (t(231)=14.29, p<.001). After adding a cardboard demo in Study 2, the percentage of correct trials remained stable but the number of additional instructions given decreased (t(103)=3.72, p<.001). Conclusions. Our study demonstrates impact of involvement of very young children in research through accessible activities. It can encourage researchers to involve young children and contribute to developing guidelines.","Casanova, T.; Black, C.; Rafiq, S.; Hugill, J.; Read, J. C.

60,"A Needs Analysis of Parents Following Sudden Cardiac Death in the Young","The sudden cardiac death (SCD) of a young person is a devastating event for any parent. Inherited heart disease is often either identified or assumed to be the cause. Few studies have explored the psychosocial impact to the surviving at-risk family members. We sought to investigate the needs of parents who have experienced the SCD of their child ([&le;]45 years). A quantitative needs analysis questionnaire was developed based on semi-structured interviews, including one focus group, and a review of relevant literature. There were 38 parents who completed a cross-sectional quantitative survey. Parents perceived needs for information and support spanned medical, psychosocial, spiritual and financial domains. Medical information and support needs were identified as the most important domains, followed by psychosocial, spiritual and financial information and support needs. Importantly, psychosocial information and support needs were reported as the most unmet need, endorsed by 54% of parents. Medical information and support needs were reported as unmet by almost one third of parents. The two most endorsed needs were ''To have the option of whether or not you would pursue genetic testing for yourself or family members'' and ''To understand what happened''. This work demonstrates for the first time, the multifactorial needs of parents after SCD in the young. With the greatest unmet need reported as psychosocial needs, there is clear necessity to find ways of integrating psychological support in to the care of families after SCD in the young.","Mcdonald, K.; Sharpe, L.; Yeates, L.; Semsarian, C.; Ingles, J.",20190703,"Cardiovascular Medicine","10.1101/19000877",1,"Jodie Ingles","Centenary Institute, The University of Sydney","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000877v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000877v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"Data will be provided upon request to the corresponding author.",2
61,"Accuracy of ECG Chest Electrode Placements by Paramedics; an observational study","Background: The use of the 12-lead ECG is common in UK paramedic practice but its value depends upon accurate placement of the ECG-electrodes. Several studies have shown widespread variation in the placement of chest electrodes by other health professionals but no studies have addressed the accuracy of paramedics. The main objective of this study was to ascertain the accuracy of the chest lead placements by registered paramedics. Methods: Registered paramedics who attended the Emergency Services Show in Birmingham in September 2018 were invited to participate in this observational study. Participants were asked to place the chest electrodes on a male model in accordance with their current practice. Correct positioning was determined against the Society for Cardiological Science & Technology's Clinical Guidelines for recording a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (2017) with a tolerance of 19mm being deemed acceptable based upon previous studies. Results: 52 eligible participants completed the study. Measurement of electrode placement in the craniocaudal and mediolateral planes showed a high level of inaccuracy with 3/52 (5.8%) participants able to accurately place all chest leads. In leads V1 - V3, the majority of incorrect placements were related to vertical displacement with most participants able to identify the correct horizontal position. In V4, the tendency was to place the lead too low and to the left of the pre-determined position whilst V5 tended to be below the expected positioning but in the correct horizontal alignment. There was a less defined pattern of error in V6 although vertical displacement was more likely than horizontal displacement. Conclusion: Our study identified a high level of variation in the placement of chest ECG electrodes which could alter the morphology of the ECG. From a patient safety perspective, we would advocate that paramedics leave the chest electrodes in situ to allow hospital staff to assess the accuracy of the placements.","Gregory, P.; Lodge, S.; Kilner, T.; Paget, S.",20190703,"Emergency Medicine","10.1101/19001321",1,"Pete Gregory","University of Wolverhampton","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001321v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001321v1.full.pdf","cc_no","10.29045/14784726.2019.12.4.3.51","The data are deidentified participant data and will be available from Pete Gregory: pete.gregory@wlv.ac.uk.

63,"Show solidarity with the Congolese people in the 10th Ebola outbreak declared a health emergency of international concern: understand a qualitative study of variables of hospital activities on infection control practices in Kinshasa city","Health workers play an important role during epidemics, but there is limited research on hospital activities on infection control practices in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and how health workers can cope during a probable health epidemic in Kinshasa city. The determinants of the current Ebola Virus Disease in the geographical distribution remain poorly understood. The World Health Organization's Health Regulation Committee decided on Wednesday July 17th, 2019 to declare the Ebola haemorrhagic fever epidemic in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri as a health emergency of international concern. The country struggles to control it against a backdrop of a health system that is already overburdened. To test the influence of the challenges of a contamination in the context of an Ebola outbreak that may face health workers and their coping strategies in thirteen hospitals of reference in Kinshasa, we conducted a survey hoping to educate or remember good practices for health workers in Kinshasa that is also available for health workers in the East Area of the country in which the ongoing Ebola outbreak progress is spreading (North Kivu and Ituri). For the ongoing outbreak, we obtained data from the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo where cases are classified as suspected, probable, or confirmed using national case definitions. We found that the ongoing Ebola virus outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo has similar epidemiological features to previous Ebola virus disease outbreak in Sierra Leone that was well described. For the qualitative study about the biosecurity in thirteen hospitals of reference in Kinshasa, we found that the Bondeko-Ngaliema Monkole group has occupied the first rank, while the group Kintambo-King Baudouin-Ndjili-Makala occupied the other end of the scale; the other health facilities occupied an intermediate position. Among the 7 hospitals which were placed at the top of this classification of biosecurity, 5 were massively subsidized by international NGO, which explains to a great extent their performances in one hand, another hand finding its explanation in the quality of their management.

64,"Liver function tests and fibrosis scores in a rural population in Africa: estimation of the burden of disease and associated risk factors","Introduction: Liver disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. However, its prevalence, distribution and aetiology have not been well characterised. We examined liver function tests (LFTs) and calculated liver fibrosis scores in a rural population in Uganda. Methodology: A cross-sectional survey of LFTs was undertaken in 2011 in a rural population cohort in South-Western Uganda. We classified abnormal LFTs based on reference ranges set in America and in Africa. We derived fibrosis scores (AST to Platelet Ratio Index, fibrosis-4, GGT to platelet ratio, red cell distribution width to platelet ratio, and S-index) to evaluate the potential prevalence of liver disease. We collected information about alcohol intake, and infection with HIV, HBV and HCV, to determine the contribution made by these factors to liver inflammation or fibrosis. Results: Data were available for 8,099 participants (median age 30 years; 56% female). The prevalence of HBV, HCV and HIV infection were 3%, 0.2% and 8%, respectively. The prevalence of abnormal LFTs was higher based on the American reference range compared to the African reference range (e.g. for AST 13% vs 3%, respectively). The prevalence of AST/ALT ratio >2 was 11%, suggestive of alcoholic hepatitis. The highest prevalence of fibrosis was suggested by the GPR score, with 24% of the population falling above the threshold for fibrosis. By multivariate analysis, elevated LFTs and fibrosis scores were most consistently associated with older age, male sex, being under-weight, infection with HIV or HBV, and alcohol consumption. Based on population attributable risk, the highest proportion of elevated fibrosis scores was associated with alcohol use (e.g. 64% of elevated S-index scores). Conclusion: Further work is required to determine normal reference ranges for LFTs in this setting, to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of fibrosis scores, and to determine aetiology of liver disease.","O'hara, G.; Mokaya, J.; Hau, J.

The overall goal of this study was to determine the safety and tolerability of Aquamin when used as a dietary chemopreventative in humans. Additionally, we determined the effects of Aquamin on the colonic microbial community and attendant metabolomic profile. Thirty healthy male and female human participants were enrolled in a 90-day trial in which the effects of Aquamin (delivering 800 mg of calcium per day) were compared to those of calcium alone or placebo. Before and after the interventional period, colonic biopsies and stool specimens were obtained. All 30 participants completed the study without serious adverse events. There were no changes in liver function markers. Compared to pretreatment values, intervention with Aquamin led to a reduction in total bacterial DNA and a shift in the microbial community. Treatment with calcium alone also produced a decline in total bacteria, but smaller than seen with Aquamin, while no reduction was observed with placebo. In parallel with microbial changes, a reduction in bile acid levels and a slight increase in the level of the short chain fatty acid (SCFA) acetate in stool specimens from Aquamin-treated participants was noted. No change in bile acids or SCFAs was observed with calcium alone or placebo. We conclude from these studies that Aquamin is safe and tolerable in healthy human participants and may produce beneficial alterations in the colonic microbial community and the attendant metabolomic profile.","Aslam, M.

66,"Misclassification of a whole genome sequence reference defined by the Human Microbiome Project: a detrimental carryover effect to microbiome studies","Taxonomic classification is an essential step in the analysis of microbiome data that depends on a reference database of whole genome sequences. Taxonomic classifiers are built on established reference species, such as the Human Microbiome Project database, that is growing rapidly. While constructing a population wide pangenome of the bacterium Hungatella, we discovered that the Human Microbiome Project reference species Hungatella hathewayi (WAL 18680) was significantly different to other members of this genus. Specifically, the reference lacked the core genome as compared to the other members. Further analysis, using average nucleotide identity (ANI) and 16s rRNA comparisons, indicated that WAL18680 was misclassified as Hungatella. The error in classification is being amplified in the taxonomic classifiers and will have a compounding effect as microbiome analyses are done, resulting in inaccurate assignment of community members and will lead to fallacious conclusions and possibly treatment. As automated genome homology assessment expands for microbiome analysis, outbreak detection, and public health reliance on whole genomes increases this issue will likely occur at an increasing rate. These observations highlight the need for developing reference free methods for epidemiological investigation using whole genome sequences and the criticality of accurate reference databases.","Bandoy, D.

68,"Using collaboration networks to identify authorship bias in meta-analyses","Meta-analytic methods are powerful resources to summarize the existing evidence concerning a given research question, and are widely used in many academic fields. However, meta-analyses can be vulnerable to various sources of bias, which should be considered to avoid inaccuracies. Many of these sources can be related to study authorship, as both methodological choices and researcher bias may lead to deviations in results between different research groups. In this work, we describe a method to objectively attribute study authorship within a given meta-analysis to different research groups by using graph cluster analysis of collaboration networks. We then provide empirical examples of how the research group of origin can impact effect size in distinct types of meta-analyses, demonstrating how non-independence between within-group results can bias effect size estimates if uncorrected. Finally, we show that multilevel random-effects models using research group as a level of analysis can be a simple tool for correcting biases related to study authorship.","Moulin, T. C.; Amaral, O.

ASD PRS most strongly associated with the ability to correctly identify angry facial emotions in youths aged 11-17 years (R2=1.06%, p=1.38x10-7) and replicated similarly in older probands (>18 years) (R2=0.55%, p=0.036). The association in 11-to-17-year-old probands was independent of other psychiatric disorders, brain imaging phenotypes, and educational attainment. ASD PRS also associated with proband-reported emotionality and connectedness with others. The proband-reported irritability trait was highly correlated with angry facial emotion recognition (r2=0.159, p=2.74x10-5) but was independently associated with ASD PRS (R2=1.20%, p=1.18x10-4). Several informant-reported (i.e., typically mother-reported) traits were predicted by the proband ASD PRS, including duration of fear (R2=0.156%, p=0.001). These data indicate how genetic liability to ASD may influence neurodevelopment in the general population, especially the development of emotional intelligence.","Wendt, F.

Recurrence after metronidazole treatment is high. HIV-negative, non-pregnant Rwandan BV patients were randomized to four groups (n=17/group) after seven-day oral metronidazole treatment: behavioral counseling only (control), or counseling plus intermittent use of oral metronidazole, Ecologic Femi+ vaginal capsule (containing multiple Lactobacillus and one Bifidobacterium species), or Gynophilus LP vaginal tablet (L. rhamnosus 35) for two months. Vaginal microbiota assessments at all visits included Gram stain Nugent scoring and 16S rRNA gene qPCR and HiSeq sequencing. All interventions were safe. BV (Nugent 7-10) incidence was 10.18 per person-year at risk in the control group, and lower in the metronidazole (1.41/person-year; p=0.004), Ecologic Femi+ (3.58/person-year; p=0.043), and Gynophilus LP groups (5.36/person-year; p=0.220). In mixed effects models adjusted for hormonal contraception/pregnancy, sexual risk-taking, and age, metronidazole and Ecologic Femi+ users, each compared to controls, had higher Lactobacillus and lower BV-anaerobes concentrations and/or relative abundances, and were less likely to have a dysbiotic vaginal microbiota type by sequencing. Inter-individual variability was high and effects disappeared soon after intervention cessation. Lactobacilli-based vaginal probiotics warrant further evaluation because, in contrast to antibiotics, they are not expected to negatively affect microbiota or cause antimicrobial resistance.","Van De Wijgert, J.; Verwijs, M.

71,"Cluster analysis successfully identifies clinically meaningful knee valgus moment patterns: Frequency of early peaks reflects sex-specific ACL injury incidence","Background: Biomechanical studies of ACL injury risk factors report heterogenous results, analyze only a fraction of the data, and do not analyze data in accordance with the injury mechanism. Extracting a peak value of relevance to ACL injuries is challenging due to differences in the relative timing of the peak value. Aims/Hypotheses: The aim was to cluster analyze the knee valgus moment time series curve shape in the early stance phase. We hypothesized that 1a) There would be few discrete curve shapes, 1b) there would be an early peak pattern, 2a) youth athletes of both sexes would show similar frequencies of early peaks, 2b) adolescent girls would have higher early peak frequencies. Methods: N=213 (39% boys) youth soccer and team handball athletes (phase 1) and N=35 (45% boys) with 5 year follow-up data (phase 2) were recorded performing a change of direction task with 3D motion analysis and a force plate. The time series of the first 30% of stance phase were cluster analyzed based on Euclidean distances in two steps; shape-based main clusters with a transformed time series, and magnitude based sub-clusters with body weight normalized time series. Group differences (sex, phase) in curve shape frequencies, and shape-magnitude frequencies were tested with chi-squared test. Results: 6 discrete shape-clusters and 14 magnitude based sub-clusters were formed. Phase 1 boys had higher frequencies of early peaks than phase 1 girls (38% vs 25% respectively, P<0.001 for full test). Phase 2 girls had higher frequencies of early peaks than phase 2 boys (42% vs 21% respectively, P<0.001 for full test). Conclusions: Cluster analysis can reveal different patterns of curve shapes in biomechanical data. The early peak shape is relatable to the ACL injury mechanism as the timing of its peak moment is consistent with the timing of injury. Higher frequency of early peaks demonstrated by Phase 2 girls is consistent with their higher incidence of ACL injury.","Sigurthsson, H.

To understand the genetics of ATTRm and SSA, we conducted a phenome-wide association study of TTR gene in 361,194 participants of European descent testing coding and non-coding variants. Among the 382 clinically-relevant phenotypes tested, TTR non-coding variants were associated with 26 phenotypic traits after multiple testing correction. These included signs related to both ATTRm and SSA such as chronic ischaemic heart disease (rs140226130, p=2.00x10-6), heart failure (rs73956431, p=2.74x10-6), atrial fibrillation (rs10163755, p=4.63x10-6), dysphagia (rs2949506, p=3.95x10-6), intestine diseases (rs970866, p=7.14x10-6) and anxiety (rs554521234, p=8.85x10-6). Consistent results were observed for TTR disease-causing mutation Val122Ile (rs76992529) with respect to carpal tunnel syndrome (p=6.41x10-6) and mononeuropathies of upper limbs (p=1.22x10-5). Sex differences were also observed in line with ATTRm and SSA epidemiology. Additionally, we explored possible modifier genes related to TTR function, observing convergent associations of RBP4 variants with the clinical phenotypes associated with TTR locus. In conclusion, we provide novel insights regarding the molecular basis of ATTRm and SSA based on large-scale cohort, expanding our understanding of the phenotypic spectrum associated with TTR gene variation.","De Lillo, A.; De Angelis, F.; Di Girolamo, M.; Luigetti, M.; Frusconi, S.; Manfellotto, D.; Fuciarelli, M.; Polimanti, R.",20190708,"Genetic And Genomic Medicine","10.1101/19001537",1,"Renato Polimanti","Yale University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001537v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001537v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"All data generated during this study are included in this published article and its Supplemental information files",5
75,"Automated interpretation of the coronary angioscopy with deep convolutional neural networks","Background: Coronary angioscopy (CAS) is a useful modality to assess atherosclerotic changes, but interpretation of the images requires expert knowledge. Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) can be used for diagnostic prediction and image synthesis. Methods: 107 images from 47 patients, who underwent coronary angioscopy in our hospital between 2014 and 2017, and 864 images, selected from 142 MEDLINE-indexed articles published between 2000 and 2019, were analyzed. First, we developed a prediction model for the angioscopic findings. Next, we made a generative adversarial networks (GAN) model to simulate the CAS images. Finally, we tried to control the output images according to the angioscopic findings with conditional GAN architecture. Results: For both yellow color (YC) grade and neointimal coverage (NC) grade, we could observe strong correlations between the true grades and the predicted values (YC grade, average r value = 0.80 {+/-} 0.02, p-value <0.001; NC grade, average r value = 0.73 {+/-} 0.02, p < 0.001). The binary classification model for the red thrombus yielded 0.71 {+/-} 0.03 F1- score and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.91 {+/-} 0.02. The standard GAN model could generate realistic CAS images (average Inception score = 3.57 {+/-} 0.06). GAN-based data augmentation improved the performance of the prediction models. In the conditional GAN model, there were significant correlations between given values and expert's diagnosis in YC grade but not in NC grade. Conclusion: DCNN is useful in both predictive and generative modeling that can help develop the diagnostic support system for CAS.","Miyoshi, T.; Higaki, A.; Kawakami, H.; Yamaguchi, O.",20200108,"Cardiovascular Medicine","10.1101/19001693",3,"Akinori Higaki","Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001693v3?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001693v3.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"The publication list where we collected angioscopic images and the source code of the prediction and generative models are available from the public online repository.

77,"Bayesian spatial modelling of childhood cancer incidence in Switzerland using exact point data: A nationwide study during 1985-2015.","Background: The aetiology of most childhood cancers is largely unknown. Spatially varying environmental factors such as traffic-related air pollution, background radiation and agricultural pesticides might contribute to the development of childhood cancer. We investigated the spatial variation of childhood cancers in Switzerland using exact geocodes of place of residence. Methods: We included 5,947 children diagnosed with cancer during 1985-2015 at age 0-15 from the Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry. We modelled cancer risk using log-Gaussian Cox processes and indirect standardization to adjust for age and year of diagnosis. We examined whether the modelled spatial variation of risk can be explained by ambient air concentration of NO2, natural background radiation, area-based socio-economic position (SEP), linguistic region, years of existing general cancer registration in the canton or degree of urbanization. Results: For all childhood cancers combined, the posterior median relative risk (RR), compared to the national level, varied by location from 0.83 to 1.13 (min to max). Corresponding ranges were 0.96 to 1.09 for leukaemia, 0.90 to 1.13 for lymphoma, and 0.82 to 1.23 for CNS tumours. The covariates considered explained 72% of the observed spatial variation for all cancers, 81% for leukaemia, 82% for lymphoma and 64% for CNS tumours. There was evidence of an association of background radiation and SEP with incidence of CNS tumours, (1.19;0.98-1.40) and (1.6;1-1.13) respectively. Conclusion: Of the investigated diagnostic groups, childhood CNS tumours show the largest spatial variation in Switzerland. The selected covariates only partially explained the observed variation of CNS tumours suggesting that other environmental factors also play a role.","Konstantinoudis, G.; Schuhmacher, D.; Ammann, R.; Diesch, T.; Kuehni, C.; Spycher, B.

79,"Public knowledge and attitude towards epilepsy and its associated factors in Debre Berhan, North Shoa, Amhara Region, Ethiopia, 2018/19. Community based cross sectional study","Introduction: Epilepsy is chronic brain disorder characterized by recurrent derangement of the nervous system due to sudden excessive disorderly discharge of the cerebral neurons. People living with epilepsy continue to suffer from enacted or perceived stigma that is based on myths, misconceptions, and misunderstandings that have persisted for many years. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the community general knowledge and attitude towards epilepsy. Methods: Community based cross sectional study was conducted to assess public general knowledge and attitude towards epilepsy and its associated factors using structured pretested questionnaire. Data was entered into Epi data version 3.1 and transported to SPSS version 21 further analysis. Both Bivariable and Multivariable Logistic Regression was done to identify associated factors. Odds Ratios and their 95% Confidence interval was computed and variables with p value less than 0.05 was considered significantly associated factors. Results: 596 study participants were participated with a response rate of 98%. Among the study participants 43.6 (95% CI: 39.6, 47.5) had poor knowledge and 41.3 (95% CI: 37.4, 45.1) had unfavorable attitude. Being secondary education, marital status, witnessed seizure, and heard the term epilepsy were showed statistically significant association with poor knowledge about epilepsy. Level of education, low average monthly income, not witnessed seizure, not heard the term epilepsy and distant from health facility showed statically significant association with the unfavorable attitude. Conclusion: In this study, Debre Berhan communities were found to have deficits in terms of general knowledge and attitude about epilepsy; and it should be given due attention.","Dargie, A.

82,"The relationship between antihypertensive medications and mood disorders: analysis of linked healthcare data for 1.8 million patients.","Background: Recent work suggests that antihypertensive medications may be useful as repurposed treatments for mood disorders. Using large-scale linked healthcare data we investigated whether certain classes of antihypertensive, such as angiotensin antagonists and calcium channel blockers, were associated with reduced risk of new-onset Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder. Method: Two cohorts of patients treated with antihypertensives were identified from Scottish prescribing (2009-2016) and hospital admission (1981-2016) records. Eligibility for cohort membership was determined by receipt of a minimum of four prescriptions for antihypertensives within a 12-month window. One treatment cohort (n=538,730) included patients with no previous history of mood disorder, whereas the other (n=262,278) included those who did. Both cohorts were matched by age, sex and area deprivation to untreated comparators. Associations between antihypertensive treatment and new-onset MDD or bipolar episodes were investigated using Cox regression. Results: For patients without a history of mood disorder, antihypertensives were associated with increased risk of new-onset MDD. For angiotensin antagonist monotherapy, the hazard ratio (HR) for new-onset MDD was 1.17 (95%CI 1.04-1.31). Beta blockers' association was stronger (HR 2.68; 95%CI 2.45-2.92), possibly indicating pre-existing anxiety. Some classes of antihypertensive were associated with protection against bipolar disorder, particularly angiotensin antagonists (HR 0.46; 95%CI 0.30-0.70). For patients with a past history of mood disorders, all classes of antihypertensives were associated with increased risk of future episodes of MDD. Conclusions: There was no evidence that antihypertensive medications prevented new episodes of MDD but angiotensin antagonists may represent a novel treatment avenue for bipolar disorder.","Shaw, R.

83,"Impact of a regional educational advertising campaign on harm perceptions of e-cigarettes, prevalence of e-cigarette use, and quit attempts among smokers","Background: We evaluated how effective an advertising campaign that was piloted by Cancer Research UK in January/February 2018 was at promoting quit attempts by increasing awareness of the relative harms of e-cigarettes compared with smoking. Methods: Adults ([&ge;]16 years, n = 2217) living in Greater Manchester (campaign region) and Yorkshire & Humber and the North East of England (control regions) completed cross-sectional surveys immediately before and after the campaign period. Surveys measured socio-demographics, perceptions and use of e-cigarettes, and motivation and attempts to quit smoking. We tested interactions between time (pre, post) and region (campaign, control). Results: 36.7% (95% CI 33.0% - 40.6%) of those in the intervention region recognised the campaign. In the general population, interactions were non-significant for all outcomes except for perception of e-cigarettes as effective cessation aids, with smaller increases from pre- to post-campaign in the campaign (49.9% to 54.0%) compared with the control region (40.5% to 55.0%; OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.45 - 0.98). Among smokers, motivation to quit increased in the intervention region (44.0% to 48.0%) but decreased in the control region (40.5% to 21.5%; OR = 2.97, 95% CI 1.25 - 7.16), with no other significant differences between regions over time. A Bayesian analysis confirmed that non-significant results were inconclusive. Conclusions: Compared with the control region, the campaign was associated with an increase in smokers' motivation to quit but a smaller increase in adults' perception of e-cigarettes as an effective cessation aid. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether the campaign affected other outcomes.","Tattan-Birch, H.; Jackson, S.

To characterize changes in the plasma metabolic profile in newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients upon commencement of conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (cDMARD) therapy. Methods. Plasma samples collected in an early RA randomized strategy study (NCT00920478) that compared clinical (DAS) disease activity assessment with musculoskeletal ultrasound assessment (MSUS) to drive treatment decisions were subjected to untargeted metabolomic analysis. Metabolic profiles were collected at pre- and 3 months post commencement of non-biologic cDMARD. Metabolites that changed in association with changes in the DAS44 score were identified at the 3 month timepoint. Results. A total of ten metabolites exhibited a clear correlation with reduction in DAS44 score following cDMARD commencement, particularly itaconate, its derived anhydride and a derivative of itaconate coA. Increasing itaconate correlated with improved DAS44 score and decreasing levels of CRP. Conclusion. cDMARD treatment effects invoke consistent changes in plasma detectable metabolites, that in turn implicate clinical disease activity with macrophages. Such changes inform RA pathogenesis and reveal for the first time a link between itaconate production and resolution of an inflammatory disease in humans. Quantitative metabolic biomarker based tests of clinical change in state are feasible and should be developed around the itaconate pathway.","Daly, R.; Blackburn, G.; Mudaliar, M.; Burgess, K.; Stirling, A.; Porter, D.; Mcinnes, I.; Barrett, M.

85,"Reduced survival in COPD patients who received long-term oxygen therapy without meeting prescription criteria: a preliminary study","Background: Randomized clinical trials have provided clear evidence that long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) increases life expectancy in severely hypoxemic COPD patients. However, in real-life settings, in global COPD cohorts, a paradoxical 2-3-fold increased risk of death has been reported in patients under LTOT. This discrepancy could be explained by a subgroup of patients under LTOT who do not meet the current guidelines and for whom LTOT would be associated with poor prognosis. This retrospective study of a global COPD cohort therefore sought to: (1) determine if a subgroup of patients under LTOT without severe hypoxemia could be distinguished, and (2) compare the mortality risk according to hypoxemia severity and LTOT prescription. Method: The sample was taken from a database (NCT02055885) on 191 stable COPD patients (age: 65.1{+/-}9.8 years, 85 women) admitted for a pulmonary rehabilitation program between 2009 and 2012 and followed until 1 January 2018. Uni- and multivariate Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR) models were used to examine the associations between clinical characteristics (age, sex, blood gases, etc.), LTOT according to PaO2 level, and mortality. Results: Forty patients (21%) were under LTOT at PR entry despite not meeting the O2 prescription criteria. Patients under LTOT had a nearly 2-fold higher mortality risk adjusted by covariates (HRmultivariate=1.83; p=0.009). Furthermore, the higher mortality risk under LTOT was specific to the patients under LTOT without severe hypoxemia (HRmultivariate=2.39; p=0.04). Conclusion: The association between LTOT and mortality might be attributed to a subgroup under LTOT despite not/no longer meeting the LTOT criteria. Further studies are needed to identify the physiological basis of this phenomenon.","Alexandre, F.; Varray, A.; Stephan, Y.; Hayot, M.; Heraud, N.",20190708,"Respiratory Medicine","10.1101/19000760",1,"Francois Alexandre","Les Cliniques du Souffle, groupe 5-Sante","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000760v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000760v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nd",NA,"The data are fully available on request to comitederecherche@5-sante.fr",2
86,"Oncofetal Protein Cripto-1 in a new clinical role: a potential tumor marker for Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.","PURPOSE: CR-1 (CR-1) is an oncofetal protein with its role as a key factor in early process of carcinoma has been evaluated in cases of various cancers. However, very few studies have reported its role in oral cancers, which is the sixth most common cancer around the world, particularly with high prevalence in developing countries. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most predominant (90%) of all the histological types of oral cancer. Late detection, associated with increased morbidity and mortality, is mainly attributed to non-availability of a suitable biomarker for the disease. In the present pilot study we have evaluated the role of soluble CR-1, in serum as a potential tumor marker for OSCC. METHODS: CR-1 was estimated using sandwich ELISA in serum samples of 50 biopsy proven OSCC patients (pre and post treatment) along with age and gender matched healthy controls. Immunohistochemistry was also done in corresponding tumor tissue sections to check the expression of CR-1. RESULTS: Pre-treatment CR-1 was found to be 2.25 fold higher in serum of OSCC patients as compared to control (p<0.0001***), which was reduced to 1.6 folds post treatment (p=0.0006***). CR-1 levels were comparatively higher in early stage of disease. Upon IHC 80% of the cases were found to be positive for CR-1. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that serum levels of CR-1 are elevated in patients of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma, which decrease post treatment. Also, the association of expression of protein with tumor progression predicts CR-1 as a molecule that can be further evaluated as a potential tumor maker in OSCC.","Jain, A.; Mallupattu, S.

87,"Higher energy requirement during weight-loss maintenance on a low- versus high-carbohydrate diet: secondary analyses from a randomized controlled feeding study","Background: Longer-term feeding studies suggest that a low-carbohydrate diet increases energy expenditure, consistent with the carbohydrate-insulin model of obesity. However, the validity of methodology utilized in these studies, involving doubly-labeled water, has been questioned. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether dietary energy requirement for weight-loss maintenance is higher on a low- versus high-carbohydrate diet. Methods: The study reports secondary outcomes and exploratory analyses from a feeding study in which the primary outcome was total energy expenditure. After attaining a mean Run-in weight loss of 10.5%, 164 adults with pre-weight-loss BMI of [&ge;]25 were randomly assigned to Test diets containing Low (20%), Moderate (40%) or High (60%) carbohydrate for 20 weeks. Calorie content of Test diets was adjusted to maintain individual body weight within 2 kg of the post-weight-loss value. In analyses by Intention-to-Treat (ITT, study completers, n=148) and Per Protocol (PP, those achieving the weight-loss maintenance target, n=110), we compared estimated energy requirement from 10 to 20 weeks on the Test diets using ANCOVA. Insulin secretion was assessed pre-weight-loss as insulin concentration 30 minutes following 75 grams oral glucose (Insulin-30). Results: Estimated energy requirement was higher in the Low vs High group by models involving ITT (ranging from 181 [CI 8-353] to 223 [40-406] kcal/d; P[&le;];0.04) and PP (ranging from 245 [43-446] to 295 [91-499] kcal/d; P[&le;];0.02). This difference remained significant in sensitivity analyses accounting for change in adiposity and possible non-adherence. In observational analyses, pre-weight loss Insulin-30 predicted adverse change in body composition following weight loss. Conclusions: Energy requirement was higher on a low- versus high-carbohydrate diet during weight-loss maintenance, commensurate with total energy expenditure. These data are consistent with the carbohydrate-insulin model and lend qualified support for the validity of the doubly-labeled water method with diets varying in macronutrient composition.","Ebbeling, C.

88,"Detection of malaria parasites in dried human blood spots using mid-infrared spectroscopy and logistic regression analysis","Background: Epidemiological surveys of malaria currently rely on microscopy, polymerase chain reaction assays (PCR) or rapid diagnostic test kits for Plasmodium infections (RDTs). This study shows that mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy coupled with supervised machine learning could constitute an alternative method for rapid malaria screening, directly from dried human blood spots. Methods: Filter papers containing dried blood spots (DBS) were obtained from a cross-sectional malaria survey in twelve wards in south-eastern Tanzania in 2018/19. The DBS were scanned using attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectrometer to obtain high-resolution MIR spectra in the range, 4000 cm-1 to 500 cm-1. The spectra were cleaned to compensate for atmospheric water vapor and CO2 interference bands and used to train different classification algorithms to distinguish between malaria-positive and malaria-negative DBS papers based on PCR test results as reference. The analysis considered 296 individuals, including 123 PCR-confirmed malaria-positives and 173 negatives. Model training was done using 80% of the dataset, after which the best-fitting model was optimized by bootstrapping of 80/20 train/test stratified splits. The trained models were evaluated by predicting Plasmodium falciparum positivity in the 20% validation set of DBS. Results: Logistic regression was the best-performing model. Considering PCR as reference, the models attained overall accuracies of 92% for predicting P. falciparum infections (specificity = 91.7%; sensitivity = 92.8%) and 85% for predicting mixed infections of P. falciparum and P. ovale (specificity = 85%, sensitivity = 85%) in the field-collected specimen. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that mid-infrared spectroscopy coupled with supervised machine learning (MIR-ML) could be used to screen for malaria parasites in dried human blood spots. The approach could have potential for rapid and high-throughput screening of Plasmodium infections in both non-clinical settings (e.g. field surveys) and clinical settings (diagnosis to aid case management). However, full utility will require further advances in classification algorithms, field validation of this technology in other study sites and an in-depth evaluation of the biological basis of the observed test results. Training the models on larger datasets could also improve specificity and sensitivity of the technique. The MIR-ML spectroscopy system is robust, low-cost, and requires minimum maintenance.","Mwanga, E. P.; Minja, E. G.; Mrimi, E.; Gonzalez Jimenez, M.; Swai, J. K.; Abbas, S.; Ngowo, H. S.; Siria, D.

89,"Post-Exposure Effects of Vaccines on Infectious Diseases","Many available vaccines have demonstrated post-exposure effectiveness, but no published systematic reviews have synthesized these findings. We searched the PubMed database for clinical trials and observational human studies concerning the post-exposure vaccination effects, targeting infections with an FDA-licensed vaccine plus dengue, hepatitis E, malaria, and tick borne encephalitis, which have licensed vaccines outside of the U.S. Studies concerning animal models, serologic testing, and pipeline vaccines were excluded. Eligible studies were evaluated by definition of exposure, and their attempt at distinguishing pre- and post-exposure effects was rated on a scale of 1-4. We screened 4518 articles and ultimately identified 14 clinical trials and 31 observational studies for this review, amounting to 45 eligible articles spanning 7 of the 28 vaccine-preventable diseases. For secondary attack rate, this body of evidence found the following medians for post-exposure vaccination effectiveness: hepatitis A: 85% (IQR: 28; 5 sources), hepatitis B: 85% (IQR: 22; 5 sources), measles: 83% (IQR: 21; 8 sources), varicella: 67% (IQR: 48; 9 sources), smallpox: 45% (IQR: 39; 4 sources), and mumps: 38% (IQR: 7; 2 sources). For case fatality proportions resulting from rabies and smallpox, the vaccine efficacies had medians of 100% (IQR: 0; 6 sources) and 63% (IQR: 50; 8 sources) post-exposure.

Although changes in DNA methylation are known to occur early in breast carcinogenesis and the landscape of breast tumor DNA methylation is profoundly altered compared with normal tissue, there have been limited efforts to identify DNA methylation field cancerization effects in histologically normal breast tissue adjacent to tumor. Methods: Matched tumor, histologically normal tissue of the ipsilateral breast (ipsilateral-normal), and histologically normal tissue of the contralateral breast (contralateral-normal) were obtained from nine women undergoing bilateral mastectomy. Laser capture microdissection was used to select breast epithelial cells from normal tissues, and neoplastic cells from tumor specimens for genome-scale measures of DNA methylation with the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC array. Results: We identified substantially more CpG loci that were differentially methylated between contralateral-normal breast and tumor tissue (63,271 CpG loci q < 0.01), than between ipsilateral-normal tissue and tumor (38,346 CpG loci q < 0.01). In addition, we identified differential methylation in ipsilateral-normal relative to contralateral-normal tissue (9,562 CpG loci p < 0.01). Hypomethylated loci in ipsilateral normal relative to contralateral were significantly enriched for breast cancer-relevant transcription factor binding sites including those for ESR1, FoxA1, and GATA3. Hypermethylated loci in ipsilateral-normal relative to contralateral-normal tissue were significantly enriched for CpG island shore regions. Conclusions: Our results indicate that early hypermethylation events in breast carcinogenesis are more likely to occur in the regions immediately surrounding CpG islands than CpG islands per se, reflecting a field effect of the tumor on surrounding histologically normal tissue. This work offers an opportunity to focus investigations of early DNA methylation alterations in breast carcinogenesis and potentially develop epigenetic biomarkers of disease risk.","Muse, M.

We compared fecal microbial communities in individuals with diverticulitis to those with uncomplicated diverticulosis. Methods: We used 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing to assess and compare the microbiota composition of fecal samples from 10 patients presenting with acute diverticulitis (cases) and 10 controls with asymptomatic diverticulosis matched on age and sex. Results: We found differences in the distribution of relative abundances of bacterial phyla and genera in diverticulitis cases versus diverticulosis controls. At the phyla level, Verrucomicrobia was more abundant on average in diverticulitis cases at the time of diagnosis than in diverticulosis controls (p=0.07). Univariate analysis identified a significant increase in the genera Coriobacteria (p=0.050), Anaerotruncus (0.046), Subdoliganulum (p=0.034), Marvinabryantia (p=0.006), and Akkermansia (p=0.04), and a decrease in Barnesiella (p=0.035) and Coprococcus (p=0.035) in diverticulitis cases at the time of diagnosis compared to diverticulosis controls. However, after correction for multiple comparisons, these differences were no longer significant. Partial least squares discriminant analysis on all microbial genera showed partial separation of diverticulitis cases at diagnosis and diverticulosis controls. The microbial alpha diversity was higher in diverticulitis cases at time of diagnosis vs controls but this was not significant (Shannon diversity index 7.4{+/-}0.6 vs 6.8{+/-}0.7, p=0.08).

94,"P-hacking in clinical trials and how incentives shapethe distribution of results across phases","Planning and execution of clinical research and publication of results should conform to the highest ethical standards, given that human lives are at stake. However, economic incentives can generate conflicts of interest for investigators, who may be inclined to withhold unfavorable results or even tamper with the data. Analyzing p-values reported to the ClinicalTrials.gov registry with two different methodologies, we find suspicious patterns only for results from trials conducted by smaller industry sponsors, with presumably less reputation at stake. First, a density discontinuity test reveals an upward jump at the classical threshold for statistical significance for Phase 3 results by small industry sponsors, suggesting some selective reporting. Second, we find an excess mass of significant results in Phase 3 compared to Phase 2. However, we can explain almost completely this excess mass for large industry sponsors, once we account for the incentives to selectively continue research through a novel technique linking trials across phases. In contrast, for trials sponsored by small pharmaceutical companies, selective continuation of trials economizing on research costs only explains one third of the increase in the number of significant results from Phase 2 to Phase 3. The different pattern depending on the type of sponsor suggests that reputational concerns can mitigate the short-run economic incentives that undermine integrity in reporting results of clinical research.","Adda, J.; Decker, C.; Ottaviani, M.",20200327,"Health Economics","10.1101/19001495",3,"Marco Ottaviani","Bocconi University","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001495v3?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001495v3.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"The study is based on publicly available data. https://clinicaltrials.gov",9

Design: A chart review of all patients treated with ETTM, following cardiac arrest. Initial patient temperature, time to target, supplemental methods (water blankets, head wraps, or ice packs), and patient survival were extracted for analysis. Setting: Community Medical Center Intensive Care Unit. Patients: All patients receiving TTM via an esophageal device post Cardiac Arrest from August 2016 to November 2018. Interventions: TTM both cooling and warming via an esophageal device. Measurements and Results: A total of 54 patients were treated from August 2016 to November 2018; 30 received ETM only, 22 received supplemental cooling, and 2 had treatment discontinued prior to reaching target due to recovery. Target temperatures ranged from 32 to 36 degrees. The median time to target temperature for the entire cohort was 219 minutes (IQR 81-415). For the cohorts without, and with, supplemental cooling modalities, the median time to attain target temperature was 128 minutes (IQR 71-334), and 285 minutes (IQR 204-660), respectively. Survival to ICU discharge was 51.9% for the entire cohort. Conclusions: ETM attains target temperature at a rate consistent with current guidelines and with similar performance to alternative modalities. This may provide a more cost-effective and approachable core cooling option to community hospitals that only use water blankets or other surface methods.","Wayne, M.

Objective: The object of this study was to examine change in situational appraisal over time, and to explore potential modifiers of that change. Methods: A prospective, longitudinal study of 146 autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) patients at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) was conducted to measure situational appraisal over time as per the meaning making model of Park and Folkman (1997) utilizing the Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised (IPQ-R; Moss-Morris et al., 2002). Participants were administered the instrument prior to transplant, at one, three and six months, and at one-year post-transplant. Results: Change over time was seen in different diagnoses, donor types, reduced intensity and standard pre-transplant preparative regimens, and between the two major ethnic groups (Caucasian and African American) studied. Many of the patient subgroups had statistically significant findings in measures of illness attribution. Conclusion: The appraisals SCT patients made of their situation in treatment revealed a complex process of appraisal affected by illness, treatment and patient characteristics including disease type, donor type, race, and pre-transplant regimen.","Blosser, J.; Sabo, R.; Candler, K.; Mullin, K.; Toor, A.; Chaber, D.",20190712,"Transplantation","10.1101/19001529",1,"Jennifer Blosser","VCU Health","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001529v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001529v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd",NA,"data housed in Red Cap via Vanderbilt",1
98,"Prediagnostic breast milk DNA methylation alterations in women who develop breast cancer","Background: Prior candidate gene studies have shown tumor suppressor DNA methylation in breast milk related with history of breast biopsy, an established risk factor for breast cancer. To further establish the utility of breast milk as a tissue-specific biospecimen for investigations of breast carcinogenesis we measured genome-wide DNA methylation in breast milk from women with and without a diagnosis of breast cancer in two independent cohorts. Methods: DNA methylation was assessed using Illumina HumanMethylation450k in 87 breast milk samples. After quality control, 368,171 autosomal CpG loci were analyzed. Cell type proportion estimates from RefFreeCellMix were calculated and adjusted for in this Epigenome Wide Association Study using linear mixed effects models adjusted for history of breast biopsy, age, time of delivery, cell type proportion estimates, array chip, and subject as random effect. Results: Epigenome-wide analyses identified 58 differentially methylated CpG sites associated with a breast cancer diagnosis in the prospectively collected milk samples from the breast that would develop cancer compared with women without a diagnosis of breast cancer (q-value < 0.05). Nearly all CpG sites associated with a breast cancer diagnosis were hypomethylated in cases compared with controls, and were enriched for CpG islands. In addition, inferred repeat element methylation was lower in breast milk DNA from cases compared to controls, and cases exhibited increased estimated epigenetic mitotic tick rate as well as DNA methylation age compared with controls. Conclusion: Breast milk has utility as a biospecimen for prospective assessment of disease risk, for understanding the underlying molecular basis of breast cancer risk factors, and improving primary and secondary prevention of breast cancer.","Salas, L.

These disorders are influenced by multiple risk factors, from genes to psychological vulnerabilities and environmental stressors but research is hampered by a lack of sufficiently large comprehensive studies. We are recruiting 40,000 individuals with lifetime depression or anxiety, with broad assessment of risks to facilitate future research. Methods: The Genetic Links to Anxiety and Depression (GLAD) Study (www.gladstudy.org.uk) recruits individuals with depression or anxiety into the NIHR Mental Health BioResource. Participants invited to join the study (via media campaigns) provide demographic, environmental and genetic data, and consent for medical record linkage and recontact. Results: Online recruitment was effective; 41,892 consented and 26,877 participants completed the questionnaire by July 2019. Participants' questionnaire data identified very high rates recurrent depression, severe anxiety and comorbidity. Participants reported high rates of treatment receipt. The age profile of sample is biased toward young adults, with higher recruitment of females and the better educated, especially at younger ages. Discussion: This paper describes the study methodology and descriptive data for GLAD, which represents a large, recontactable resource that will enable future research into risks, outcomes and treatment for anxiety and depression.","Davies, M.

Yet, questions remain about applying this approach to psychiatric conditions that are characterized by complex behaviors that occur outside the laboratory. Here, we compared individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN), whose self-starvation appears both excessively goal-directed and habitual, with healthy controls (HC) to assess: 1) whether their behavior is characterized by enhanced or diminished model-based behavior, 2) the domain specificity of any abnormalities by comparing learning in a food-specific context as well as in a monetary context, and 3) whether impairments are secondary to starvation by comparing learning before and after initial treatment. Across all conditions, individuals with AN showed an impairment in model-based, but not model-free, learning, suggesting a general and persistent contribution of habitual over goal-directed control, across domains and timepoints.","Foerde, K.; Daw, N.; Rufin, T.; Walsh, B.

102,"Design of a computer model for the identification of adolescent swimmers with low BMD","Objectives: This paper aims to elaborate a decision tree for the early detection of adolescent swimmers at risk of presenting low bone mineral density (BMD), based on easily measurable fitness and performance variables. Methods: Bone mineral status of 78 adolescent swimmers was determined using DXA scans at the hip and subtotal body. Participants also underwent physical fitness (upper and lower body strength, running speed and cardiovascular endurance) and performance (swimming history, speed and ranking) assessments. A gradient boosting machine regression tree was built in order to predict BMD of the swimmers and to further develop a simpler individual decision tree, using a subtotal BMD height-adjusted Z-score of -1 as threshold value. Results: The predicted BMD using the gradient boosted model was strongly correlated with the actual BMD values obtained from DXA (r=0.960, p<0.0001) with a root mean squared error of 0.034 g/cm2. According to a simple decision tree, that showed a 73.9% of classification accuracy, swimmers with a body mass index (BMI) lower than 17 kg/m2 or a handgrip strength inferior to 43kg with the sum of both arms could be at higher risk of having low BMD. Conclusion: Easily measurable fitness variables (BMI and handgrip strength) could be used for the early detection of adolescent swimmers at risk of suffering from low BMD. The presented decision tree could be used in training settings to determine the necessity of further BMD assessments.","Marin-Puyalto, J.; Gomez-Cabello, A.; Gomez-Bruton, A.; Matute-Llorente, A.; Gonzalez-Aguero, A.; Casajus, J.

However, these resources may not adequately reveal pharmaceutical-author interactions and their potential conflicts of interest (CoIs). This investigation: 1) evaluated the correspondence of two well-utilized CoI databases: the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Open Payments (CMSOP) and ProPublica Dollars for Docs (PDD) and 2) quantified CoIs among authors of a publically available point of care clinical support website. Two data sources were used: the hundred most common drugs and the top fifty causes of death. These topics were entered into a freely available database. The authors (N = 139) were then input into CMSOP and PDD and compensation and number of payment were determined for 2013-2015. The subset of highly compensated authors that also reported quote: Nothing to disclose, unquote, were further examined. There was a high degree of similarity between CMSOP and PDD for compensation (R2 > 0.998) and payment number (R2 > 0.992). The amount received was 1.4% higher in CMSOP ($4,059,194) than in PDD ($4,002,891). The articles where the authors had received the greatest compensation were in neurology (Parkinsons Disease = $1,810,032), oncology (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia = $616,727), and endocrinology (Type I Diabetes = $377,388). Two authors reporting Nothing to disclose received appreciable and potentially relevant compensation. CMSOP and PDD produced almost identical results. CoIs were common among authors but self-reporting may be an inadequate reporting mechanism. Recommendations are offered for improving the CoI transparency of pharmaceutical-author interactions in point-of-care electronic resources.","Chopra, A. C.; Tilberry, S.; Sternat, K. E.; Chung, D.

104,"Actigraphic Screening for Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder","Background: The patients suffering of the rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) are in high risk of developing a neurodegenerative disorder, most frequently from the group of alpha-synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) or multiple system atrophy (MSA). The definitive diagnosis of RBD is based on polysomnographic investigation. Actigraphy is much easier to perform and reflects condition in patient's home environment. The aims: The aim of this study was to find suitable biomarkers for RBD, which can be detectable by actigraphic recording. Methods: High resolution actigraphic recording (MotionWatch, CamNtech ltd.) and confirming polysomnographic recording was performed on 45 RBD patients, 30 patients with other sleep-related motor disorders and 20 healthy controls. Each individual file was analysed by software testing for amount of sleep (MotionWare 1.1.20) and secondly for periodic motor activity (PLMS analysis 1.0.16). The 13-item patient self-rating RBD screening questionnaire (RBD-SQ) translated to Czech language was also used for screening purposes. We used an RBD-SQ score of five points as a positive test result, as suggested by the original publication of the scale. Results: When using the actigraphic sleep detection, we encountered significant differences mostly on non-dominant hand, related to sleep fragmentation - most notably increased percentage of Short immobile bouts (47.0% vs. 28.0%, p<0.0001), increased Fragmentation index (72.5 vs. 40.7, p<0.0001) and decreased percentage of Sleep efficiency (72.1% vs. 86.8%, p<0.0001)in RBD subjects compared to other sleep disorders and controls. When analyzing periodic motor activity, we also found surprisingly more periodic hand movements (p=0.028, corrected for multiple testing), but differences on lower extremities using either measurement were not significant. The discrimination function based on RBD-SQ and Short immobile bouts % could allocate correctly the RBD status in 87.6% of cases with Wilks Lambda 0.435 and p<0.0001. Conclusion: In our single-center study in patients from the Czech population, we found that actigraphic recording from upper extremities shows consistently more prominent sleep fragmentation in RBD patients compared to other sleep diagnoses or healthy controls. Actigraphy may be useful in broader screening for RBD.","Sandala, K.; Dostalova, S.; Nepozitek, J.; Ibarburu, V.; Dusek, P.; Ruzicka, E.; Sonka, K.; Kemlink, D.",20190714,"Neurology","10.1101/19001867",1,"David Kemlink","First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001867v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001867v1.full.pdf","cc_no",NA,"The datasets used and analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request",2

However, its anti-thrombotic effects are unexplored. We aimed to assess whether this diet improved platelet, coagulation, and fibrinolysis-related biomarkers in cardiovascular risk subjects. In 358 random PREDIMED Study volunteers (Prevencion con Dieta Mediterranea), we assessed: 1) 1-year effects on thrombosis of TMD, enriched in virgin olive oil (TMD-VOO; N=120) or nuts (TMD-Nuts; N=119), versus a low-fat diet (N=119), and 2) associations between 1-year biomarker changes and increments in Mediterranean Diet adherence and key food group intakes. TMD-Nuts attenuated pro-thrombotic status (P=0.029), whilst TMD-VOO did it in a marginally significant way (P=0.076). TMD-VOO decreased HDL-bound alpha1-antitrypsin levels (HDL pro-inflammatory/pro-thrombotic properties, P=0.034) and increased HDL platelet activating factor-acetylhydrolase activity (P=0.024). TMD-Nuts diminished non-esterified fatty acid levels (P=0.034). Only the low-fat diet was associated with increased platelet factor-4 concentrations (P=0.012) and thrombin activation (higher prothrombin factor1+2 levels, P=0.003) versus baseline. 2-point TMD adherence increments were linked to 10.2 mg/dL fibrinogen decrements (P=0.011). 1-serving increments in vegetable intake were associated with platelet factor-4 concentration decreases (-9.21%, P=0.031). 1-portion increments in fruit and fatty fish consumption were linked to thrombin generation decrements (-7.72% -P=0.007- and -13.2% -P=0.046-, respectively). Increases in antithrombin levels were related to 1-serving increments in nut intake (+2.34%, P=0.033) and reductions in processed meat consumption (+2.00%, P=0.018). Finally, 1-portion decreases in processed meat intake were associated with reduced plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels (-10.4%, P=0.008).

Here we explored the effects of cholecalciferol supplementation on circulating cytokines in severely vitamin D deficient (blood 25(OH)D3 << 30 nmol/L) adolescents aged 12-15 from Mongolia. The study included 28 children receiving 800 IU daily cholecalciferol for 6 months spanning winter and spring, and 30 children receiving placebo during the same period. The levels of 25(OH)D3 were assessed at baseline, three and six months. Twenty-one cytokines were measured in serum at baseline and at six months. The median blood 25(OH)D3 concentration at baseline was 13.7 nmol/L (IQR=10.0-21.7). Supplementation tripled blood 25(OH)D3 levels (p<0.001) and reversed the direction of change for most cytokines (16/21, 86%). Supplementation was associated with elevated interleukin (IL)-6 (p=0.043). The placebo group had reduced MIP-1 (p=0.007) and IL-8 (p=0.034) at six months.

110,"Reproducibility and transparency characteristics of oncology research evidence","Introduction: As much as 50%-90% of research is estimated to be irreproducible, costing upwards of $28 billion in the United States alone. Reproducible research practices are essential to improving the reproducibility and transparency of biomedical research, such as including pre-registering studies, publishing a protocol, making research data and metadata publicly available, and publishing in open access journals. Here we report an investigation of key reproducible or transparent research practices in the published oncology literature. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of a random sample of 300 oncology studies published from 2014-2018. We extracted key reproducibility and transparency characteristics in a duplicative fashion by blinded investigators using a pilot tested Google Form. Results: Of the 300 studies randomly sampled, 296 studies were analyzed for study reproducibility characteristics. Of these 296 studies, 194 were contained empirical data that could be analyzed for reproducible and transparent research practices. Raw data was available for 9 studies (4.6%). Approximately 5 studies (2.6%) provided a protocol. Despite our sample including 15 clinical trials and 7 systematic reviews/meta-analyses, only 7 included a pre-registration statement. Less than 25% (65/194) of studies provided an author conflict of interest statement. Discussion: We found that key reproducibility and transparency characteristics were absent from a random sample of published oncology studies.

111,"Redefining typhoid diagnosis: what would an improved test need to look like?","Introduction: Typhoid fever is one of the most common bacterial causes of acute febrile illness in the developing world, with an estimated 10.9 million new cases and 116.8 thousand deaths in 2017. Typhoid point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tests are widely used but have poor sensitivity and specificity, resulting in antibiotic overuse that has led to the emergence and spread of multidrug resistant strains. With recent advances in typhoid surveillance and detection, this is the ideal time to produce a target product profile (TPP) that guides product development and ensure that a next-generation test meets the needs of users in the resource-limited settings where typhoid is endemic. Methods: A structured literature review was conducted to develop a draft TPP for a next-generation typhoid diagnostic test with minimal and optimal desired characteristics for 36 test parameters. The TPP was refined using feedback collected from a Delphi survey of key stakeholders in clinical medicine, microbiology, diagnostics and public and global health. Results: A next-generation typhoid diagnostic test should improve patient management through the diagnosis and treatment of infection with acute Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi or Paratyphi with a sensitivity [&ge;]90% and specificity [&ge;]95%. The test would ideally be used at the lowest level of the healthcare system in settings without a reliable power or water supply and provide results in less than 15 minutes at a cost of <$1.00 USD. Conclusion: This report outlines the first comprehensive TPP for typhoid fever and is intended to guide the development of a next-generation typhoid diagnostic test. An accurate POC test will reduce the morbidity and mortality of typhoid fever through rapid diagnosis and treatment and will have the greatest impact in reducing antimicrobial resistance if it is combined with diagnostics for other causes of acute febrile illness in a treatment algorithm.","Mather, R.; Hopkins, H.; Parry, C.; Dittrich, S.",20190714,"Infectious Diseases","10.1101/19001958",1,"Richard Mather","London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001958v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001958v1.full.pdf","cc_by","10.1136/bmjgh-2019-001831","All data can be made available.",9
114,"Earliest infections predict the age distribution of seasonal influenza A cases","Seasonal variation in the age distribution of influenza A cases suggests that factors other than age shape susceptibility to medically attended infection. We ask whether these differences can be partly explained by protection conferred by childhood influenza infection, which has lasting impacts on immune responses to influenza and protection against new influenza A subtypes (phenomena known as original antigenic sin and immune imprinting). Fitting a statistical model to data from studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE), we find that primary infection appears to reduce the risk of medically attended infection with that subtype throughout life. This effect is stronger for H1N1 compared to H3N2. Additionally, we find evidence that VE varies with both age and birth year, suggesting that VE is sensitive to early exposures. Our findings may improve estimates of age-specific risk and VE in similarly vaccinated populations and thus improve forecasting and vaccination strategies to combat seasonal influenza.","Arevalo, P.; Mclean, H.

115,"Ethnicity and Acculturation: Asian American Substance Use from Early Adolescence to Mature Adulthood","Research on Asian American substance use has, to date, been limited by monolithic conceptions of Asian identity, inadequate attention to acculturative process, and a disproportionate focus on the adolescent developmental period. This study addresses these limitations by longitudinally investigating disparities in substance use, including tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, and a range of illicit drugs, from early adolescence (~15) into mature adulthood (~40) using five waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). Ample statistical power (Asian N=1583, obs=7915) allowed disaggregated study of the most populous Asian American ethnic groups including Chinese, Filipino, Korean, Vietnamese, Asian Indian, and Japanese, as well as subjects identifying as multiple Asian ethnicities (i.e., multiethnic) and multiracial Asians. The potential mediating role of acculturative factors (e.g., nativity, parental nativity, familial language use) on the observed ethnic disparities was also examined. Results indicate significant variation across Asian ethnicities, with the lowest probability of substance use among Chinese and Vietnamese, and the highest among multiethnic and multiracial Asians. Acculturative factors (e.g., English language use, nativity) were strongly associated with increased substance use, and mediated some, but not all, of the observed ethnic disparities. This study demonstrates how the model minority stereotype masks significant ethnic disparities in Asian American substance use and argues that a considerable proportion of the observed ethnic variation appears to be due to diverse family ties speeding transition toward US cultural norms, away from the relatively salubrious norms of Asian nations of origin.","Ahmmad, Z.; Adkins, D.

117,"Childhood immune imprinting to influenza A shapes birth year-specific risk during seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 epidemics","Across decades of co-circulation in humans, influenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 have caused seasonal epidemics characterized by different age distributions of cases and mortality. H3N2 causes the majority of relatively severe, clinically attended cases in high-risk elderly cohorts, and the majority of overall deaths, whereas H1N1 causes fewer deaths overall, and cases shifted towards young and middle-aged adults. These contrasting age profiles may result from differences in childhood exposure to H1N1 and H3N2 or from differences in evolutionary rate between subtypes. Here we analyze a large epidemiological surveillance dataset to test whether childhood immune imprinting shapes seasonal influenza epidemiology, and if so, whether it acts primarily via immune memory of a particular influenza subtype or via broader immune memory that protects across subtypes. We also test the impact of evolutionary differences between influenza subtypes on age distributions of cases. Likelihood-based model comparison shows that narrow, within-subtype imprinting shapes seasonal influenza risk alongside age-specific risk factors. The data do not support a strong effect of evolutionary rate, or of broadly protective imprinting that acts across subtypes. Our findings emphasize that childhood exposures can imprint a lifelong immunological bias toward particular influenza subtypes, and that these cohort-specific biases shape epidemic age distributions. As a result, newer and less ""senior"" antibody responses acquired later in life do not provide the same strength of protection as responses imprinted in childhood. Finally, we project that the relatively low mortality burden of H1N1 may increase in the coming decades, as cohorts that lack H1N1-specific imprinting eventually reach old age.","Gostic, K.

122,"Pain in clients attending a South African voluntary counselling and testing centre was frequent and extensive but did not depend on HIV status.","Background: The frequency of pain is reported to be high in people living with HIV (PLWH), but valid comparisons between PLWH and HIV-negative cohorts are rare. We investigated whether HIV infection influenced frequency and characteristics of pain in adults undergoing voluntary testing for HIV. Methods: Participants were recruited from a HIV voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) centre at the Chris Hani Baragwanath Academic Hospital, Soweto, South Africa. Pain was assessed using the Wisconsin Brief Pain Questionnaire. Depressive and anxiety symptomatology was determined using the Hopkins Symptom checklist-25. We then stratified by HIV status. Results: Data from 535 black South Africans were analysed: HIV-infected n=70, HIV uninfected n=465. Overall, frequency of pain was high with 59% (95%CI: 55; 63, n: 316/535) of participants reporting pain, with no difference related to HIV status: HIV-infected 50% (95% CI: 37; 61, n: 35/70), HIV-uninfected 60% (95%CI: 56; 65, n: 281/465). Pain intensity and number of pain sites were similar between the groups as were symptoms of anxiety and depression: mean HSCL-25 1.72 (95% CI 1.57; 1.87) HIV-infected participants and 1.68 (95% CI: 1.63; 1.73) HIV-uninfected participants. Univariate analysis showed female sex and greater depressive and anxiety symptomatology associated with having pain. In a conservative multivariable model, only depressive and anxiety symptomatology was retained in the model. Conclusion: The high frequency of pain found in both HIV infected and uninfected individuals presenting at a VCT centre was more likely to be associated with depression and anxiety, than with the presence or absence of HIV.","Wadley, A.

128,"Confounding adjustment performance of ordinal analysis methods in stroke studies","Background: In acute stroke studies, ordinal logistic regression (OLR) is often used to analyze outcome on the modified Rankin Scale (mRS), whereas the non-parametric Mann-Whitney measure of superiority (MWS) has also been suggested. It is unclear how these perform comparatively when confounding adjustment is warranted. Our aim is to quantify the performance of OLR and MWS in different confounding variable settings. Methods: We set up a simulation study with three different scenarios; (1) dichotomous confounding variables, (2) continuous confounding variables, and (3) confounding variable settings mimicking a study on functional outcome after stroke. We compared adjusted ordinal logistic regression (aOLR) and stratified Mann-Whitney measure of superiority (sMWS), and also used propensity scores to stratify the MWS (psMWS). For comparability, OLR estimates were transformed to a MWS. We report bias, the percentage of runs that produced a point estimate deviating by more than 0.05 points (point estimate variation), and the coverage probability. Results: In scenario 1, there was no bias in both sMWS and aOLR, with similar point estimate variation and coverage probabilities. In scenario 2, sMWS resulted in more bias (0.04 versus 0.00), and higher point estimate variation (41.6% versus 3.3%), whereas coverage probabilities were similar. In scenario 3, there was no bias in both methods, point estimate variation was higher in the sMWS (6.7%) versus aOLR (1.1%), and coverage probabilities were 0.98 (sMWS) versus 0.95 (aOLR). With psMWS, bias remained 0.00, with less point estimate variation (1.5%) and a coverage probability of 0.95. Conclusions: The bias of both adjustment methods was similar in our stroke simulation scenario, and the higher point estimate variation in the MWS improved with propensity score based stratification. The stratified MWS is a valid alternative for adjusted OLR only when the ratio of number of strata versus number of observations is relatively low, but propensity score based stratification extends the application range of the MWS.","Zonneveld, T.

129,"Early clinical markers of aggressive multiple sclerosis","Patients with the 'aggressive' form of MS accrue disability at an accelerated rate, typically reaching EDSS >= 6 within 10 years of symptom onset. Several clinicodemographic factors have been associated with aggressive MS, but less research has focused on clinical markers that are present in the first year of disease. The development of early predictive models of aggressive MS is essential to optimise treatment in this MS subtype. We evaluated whether patients who will develop severe MS can be identified based on early clinical markers, and to replicate this analysis in an independent cohort. Patient data were obtained from MSBase. Inclusion criteria were (a) first recorded disability score (EDSS) within 12 months of symptom onset, (b) at least 2 recorded EDSS scores, and (c) at least 10 years of observation time. Patients were classified as having 'aggressive MS' if they: (a) reached EDSS >= 6 within 10 years of symptom onset, (b) EDSS >=6 was confirmed and sustained over >=6 months, and (c) EDSS >=6 was sustained until the end of follow-up. Clinical predictors included patient variables (sex, age at onset, baseline EDSS, disease duration at first visit) and recorded relapses in the first 12 months since disease onset (count, pyramidal signs, bowel-bladder symptoms, cerebellar signs, incomplete relapse recovery, steroid administration, hospitalisation). Predictors were evaluated using Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA). Independent validation was performed using data from the Swedish MS Registry. Of the 2,403 patients identified, 145 were classified as having aggressive MS (6%). BMA identified three statistical predictors: age > 35 at symptom onset, EDSS >= 3 in the first year, and the presence of pyramidal signs in the first year. This model significantly predicted aggressive MS (AUC = .80, 95% CIs = .75, .84). The presence of all three signs was strongly predictive, with 32% of such patients meeting aggressive disease criteria. The absence of all three signs was associated with a 1.4% risk. Of the 556 eligible patients in the Swedish MS Registry cohort, 34 (6%) met criteria for aggressive MS. The combination of all three signs was also predictive in this cohort (AUC = .75, 95% CIs = .66, .84). Taken together, these findings suggest that older age at symptom onset, greater disability during the first year, and pyramidal signs in the first year are early indicators of aggressive MS.","Malpas, C.

133,"The global scientific research response to the public health emergency of Zika virus infection","Background: Science studies have been a field of research for different knowledge areas and they have been successfully used to analyse the construction of scientific knowledge, practice and dissemination. In this study, we aimed to verify how the Zika epidemic has moulded scientific production worldwide analysing international collaboration and the knowledge landscape through time, research topics and country involvement. Methodology: We searched the Web of Science (WoS) for studies published up to 31st December 2018 on Zika using the search terms zika, zkv or zikv. We analysed the scientific production regarding which countries have published the most, on which topics, as well as country level collaboration. We performed a scientometric analysis of research on Zika focusing on knowledge mapping and the scientific research path over time and space. Findings: We found two well defined research areas divided into three subtopics accounting for six clusters. With regard to country analysis, the USA followed by Brazil were the leading countries in publications on Zika. China entered as a new player focusing on specific research areas. When we took into consideration the epidemics and reported cases, Brazil and France were the leading research countries on related topics. As for international collaboration, the USA followed by England and France stand out as the main hubs. The research areas most published included public health related topics from 2015 until the very beginning of 2016, followed by an increase in topics related to the clinical aspects of the disease in 2016 and the beginnings of laboratorial research in 2017/2018. Conclusions: Mapping the response to Zika, a public health emergency, demonstrated a clear pattern of the participation of countries in the scientific advances. The pattern of knowledge production found in this study represented the different perspectives and interests of countries based firstly on their level of exposure to the epidemic and secondly on their financial positions with regard to science.","Oliveira, J.

DESIGN: Pregnancy cohort SETTING: Population-based, nation-wide study in Norway PARTICIPANTS: 86,306 children in The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study born from 1999 through 2009, followed to April 15, 2018. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical type 1 diabetes, ascertained in a nation-wide childhood diabetes registry. Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox regression for the exposures maternal gluten intake up to week 22 of pregnancy and child's gluten intake when the child was 18 months old. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 12.3 years (range 0.7-16.0), 346 children (0.4%) developed type 1 diabetes (incidence rate 32.6 per 100,000 person-years). The average gluten intake was 13.6 grams/day for mothers during pregnancy, and 8.8 grams/day for the child at 18 months of age. Maternal gluten intake in mid-pregnancy was not associated with the development of type 1 diabetes in the child (adjusted hazard ratio 1.02 (95% confidence interval 0.73 to 1.43) per 10 grams/day increase in gluten intake). However, the child's gluten intake at 18 months of age was associated with an increased risk of later developing type 1 diabetes (adjusted hazard ratio 1.46 (95% confidence interval 1.06 to 2.01) per 10 grams/day increase in gluten intake). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the child's gluten intake at 18 months of age, and not the maternal intake during pregnancy, could increase the risk of type 1 diabetes in the child.","Lund-Blix, N.

It is currently necessary to develop specific serological tests that can efficiently discriminate the flaviviruses that circulate in our country. The immunoassays to diagnose SLEV lack specificity because they are based on the detection of structural viral proteins and the human immunoglobulins produced during infection against these proteins cross-react with other flaviviruses. Here, we describe an enzyme-immunoassay designed to detect human IgG antibodies specific to the viral nonstructural protein NS5. The results indicate that NS5 is a promising antigen useful to discriminate SLEV from other circulating flaviviruses.","Simari, M. B.; Goni, S. E.; Luppo, V. C.; Fabbri, C. M.; Arguelles, M.

149,"Acute hepatitis C infection among adults with HIV in the Netherlands: a capture-recapture analysis","Background: Reliable surveillance systems are essential to assess the national response to eliminating hepatitis C virus (HCV), in the context of the global strategy towards eliminating viral hepatitis. Aim: We aimed to assess the completeness of the two national registries of acute HCV infection in people with HIV, and estimated the number of acute HCV infections among adults with HIV in the Netherlands. Methods: For 2003-2016, cases of HCV infection and reinfection among adults with a positive or unknown HIV-serostatus were identified in two national registries: the ATHENA cohort, and the National Registry for Notifiable Diseases. For 2013-2016, cases were linked, and two-way capture-recapture analysis was carried out. Results: During 2013-2016, there were an estimated 282 (95%CI: 264-301) acute HCV infections among adults with HIV. The addition of cases with an unknown HIV-serostatus increased the matches (from N=104 to N=129), and a subsequently increased the estimated total: 330 (95%CI: 309-351). Underreporting was estimated at 14-20%. Conclusion: In 2013-2016, up to 330 cases of acute HCV infection were estimated to have occurred among adults with HIV. National surveillance of acute HCV can be improved by increased notification of infections. Surveillance data should ideally include both acute and chronic HCV infections, and be able to distinguish between acute and chronic infections, and initial and reinfections.","Boender, T.

152,"Sitagliptin decreases visceral fat and blood glucose in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome","Context: Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) have decreased growth hormone (GH), which can increase visceral adiposity (VAT) and impair vascular function. GH releasing hormone, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) substrate, stimulates GH secretion. Objective: We tested the hypothesis that DPP4 inhibition increases GH and improves glucose levels and vascular function in women with PCOS. Methods: Eighteen women with PCOS participated in a double-blinded, cross-over study. They received sitagliptin 100 mg vs. placebo daily for one month separated by an eight-week washout. During each treatment, women underwent a 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), assessment of vascular function and body composition. Overnight GH secretion was assessed via venous sampling every 10 minutes for 12 hours and analyzed using an automated deconvolution algorithm. Results: During OGTT, sitagliptin increased GLP-1 (p<0.001), early insulin secretion (from mean insulinogenic index 1.9{+/-}1.2 (SD) to 3.2{+/-} 3.1; p=0.02) and decreased peak glucose (mean -17.2 mg/dL [95% CI -27.7, -6.6]; p<0.01). At one month, sitagliptin decreased VAT (from 1141.9{+/-}700.7 to 1055.1{+/-}710.1 g; p=0.02) but did not affect vascular function. Sitagliptin increased GH half-life (from 13.9{+/-}3.6 to 17.0{+/-}6.8 min, N=16; p=0.04) and interpulse interval (from 53.2{+/-}20.0 to 77.3{+/-}38.2 min, N=16; p<0.05) but did not increase mean overnight GH (p=0.92 vs. placebo). Conclusions: Sitagliptin decreased the maximal glucose response to OGTT and VAT. Sitagliptin did not increase overnight GH but increased GH half-life and the interpulse interval. Precis: Sitagliptin improved body composition and blood glucoses following oral glucose load in women with PCOS. Sitagliptin potentiated GH half-life but did not increase overnight GH levels.","Devin, J. K.; Wright, P.; Celedonio, J. E.; Nian, H.; Brown, N.

158,"Modified Long-Axis In-Plane Ultrasound Technique Versus Conventional Palpation Technique For Radial Arterial Cannulation: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial","Background: A low first-pass success rate of radial artery cannulation was obtained when using the conventional palpation technique(C-PT) or ultrasound-guided techniques, we therefore evaluate the effect of a modified long-axis in-plane ultrasound technique (M-LAINUT) in guiding radial artery cannulation in adults. MethodsWe conducted a prospective, randomized and controlled clinical trial of 288 patients undergoing radial artery cannulation. Patients were randomized 1:1 to M-LAINUT or C-PT group at fujian medical university union hospital between 2017 and 2018. Radial artery cannulation was performed by three anesthesiologists with different experience. The outcome was the first and total radial artery cannulation success rates, the number of attempts and the cannulation time. Results: 285 patients were statistically analyzed. The success rate of first attempt was 91.6% in the M-LAINUT group (n=143) and 57.7% in the C-PT group (n=142; P<0.001) (odds ratio, 7.9; 95% confidence interval, 4.0-15.7). The total success rate ([&le;]5 min and [&le;]3 attempts) in the M-LAINUT group was 97.9%, compared to 84.5% in the palpation group (p <0.001) (odds ratio, 8.5; 95% confidence interval, 2.5-29.2). The total cannulation time was shorter and the number of attempts was fewer in the M-LAINUT group than that in the C-PT group (p <0. 05). Conclusion: Modified long-axis in-plane ultrasound-guided radial artery cannulation can increase the first and total radial artery cannulation success rates, reduce the number of attempts and shorten the total cannulation time in adults.","Wang, J.; Lai, Z.; Weng, X.; Lin, Y.; Wu, G.; Huang, Q.; Su, J.; Zeng, J.; Liu, J.; Zhao, Z.; Yan, T.; Zhang,, L.; Zhou, L.",20190720,"Anesthesia","10.1101/19001586",1,"Liangcheng Zhang,","Department of Anesthesiology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, No.29 Xin-Quan Road, Fuzhou, 350001, China","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001586v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19001586v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd","10.1097/MD.0000000000018747","The data used to support the findings of this study are included within the article.",5

186,"A single-blinded randomized crossover trial comparing peer-to-peer and standard instruction on airway management skill training","Background Peer-to-peer teaching, which is an alternative to standard teaching (by expert instructors), has the potential to emphasize student self-learning and reduce the cost and workload of the instructor. Self-instruction videos with peer feedback are highlighted in many medical and nursing school curricula. Objective To evaluate whether peer to peer instruction supported by a structured curriculum and video exemplars is not inferior to standard instructor-led teaching in basic airway management skill, knowledge, and confidence attainment. Method This single blinded randomized crossover trial was conducted with a sample of novice nursing students. Data was collected through the pre- to post- knowledge and confidence assessments. The students were randomly assigned to two crossover groups. Each student learned basic airway management skills through both methods. The students performances were recorded in every session with recordings reviewed by blinded expert instructors. Results The study included 48 participants, who were assigned into both the expert instruction group and peer-to-peer group through computer generated randomization. The skill rating scores of the peer-to-peer group were not inferior to the standard teaching. With further analysis, we noted that the peer-to-peer group scores had significantly higher scores demonstrating a large effect size (Cohens d of 1.07 (p-value 0.002) for oropharyngeal airway insertion, 1.14 (p-value <0.001) for nasopharyngeal airway insertion and 0.81 (p-value 0.003) for bag mask ventilation). There was no significant difference between pre- and post- knowledge scores across groups (p-value of 0.13 and 0.22 respectively). Participants in both groups reported higher confidence after learning. However, the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions Undergraduate nursing students trained in basic airway management skills by peer-to-peer instruction and a structured curriculum did not show inferior scores compared to the students who were trained by expert instructors. There was no significant difference in the knowledge and confidence levels between the groups.","Surabenjawong, U.; Phrampus, P.

189,"Microbiota and Health Study: a prospective cohort of respiratory and diarrheal infections and associated risk factors in Bangladeshi infants under two years","Background: Early childhood respiratory and diarrheal infections are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. There is a need to further assess the epidemiology through prospective and community-based studies to gain key insights that could inform preventative measures to reduce the risk of infectious disease in this vulnerable population. We aimed to analyze the burden and determinants of acute respiratory infection (ARI) and diarrhea episodes affecting infants during their first 2 years of life with state-of-the-art molecular technologies. Methods: The ARI and diarrhea episodes were prospectively collected in a community-based, longitudinal cohort of infants (n=267) from birth to 2 years of life in Bangladesh. Women were recruited during the third trimester of pregnancy. Demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental information on the households was recorded. Nasopharyngeal and fecal samples were collected during regular scheduled visits from mother-infant pairs, and also from the infants during unscheduled visits for reported illnesses. New generation sequencing methods will be utilized to determine microbiota composition and function, supplemented by the state-of-the-art multiplex molecular detection technology for a wide range of bacterial and viral pathogens. Discussion: This study sought to assess the epidemiology of both respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses during the first 2 years of life in children from a peri-urban community of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Characteristics of the mothers, as well as birth characteristics of infants enrolled in the Microbiota and Health Study are presented here. We will determine any potential association between microbiota composition and the abovementioned illnesses, and also examine the influence of known and hypothesized risk factors on the occurrence of infections. Such putative factors include environmental, socioeconomic, maternal, clinical, and selected genetic factors, namely the variation of the fucosyltransferase genes (FUT2 and FUT3) of mothers and infants. This study will add to current knowledge about these early childhood infectious diseases, and will provide data to generate hypotheses for the development of nutritional approaches to be used as prevention strategies. Trial registration: The study was retrospectively registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02361164 (February 11, 2015).","Vidal, K.; Sultana, S.; Prieto Patron, A.; Binia, A.; Rahman, M.; Deeba, I.

199,"FDA oversight of NSIGHT genomic research: the need for an integrated systems approach to regulation","The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded the Newborn Sequencing In Genomic medicine and public HealTh (NSIGHT) Consortium to investigate the implications, challenges and opportunities associated with the possible use of genomic sequence information in the newborn period. Following announcement of the NSIGHT awardees in 2013, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) contacted investigators and requested that pre-submissions to investigational device exemptions (IDE) be submitted for the use of genomic sequencing under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR) part 812. IDE regulation permits clinical investigation of medical devices that have not been approved by the FDA. To our knowledge, this marked the first time the FDA determined that NIH-funded clinical genomic research projects are subject to IDE regulation. Here we review the history of and rationale behind FDA oversight of clinical research and the NSIGHT Consortiums experiences in navigating the IDE process. Overall, NSIGHT investigators found that FDAs application of existing IDE regulations and medical device definitions aligned imprecisely with the aims of publicly funded exploratory clinical research protocols. IDE risk assessments by the FDA were similar to, but distinct from, protocol risk assessments conducted by local Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), and had the potential to reflect novel oversight of emerging genomic technologies. However, the pre-IDE and IDE process delayed the start of NSIGHT research studies by an average of 10 months, and significantly limited the scope of investigation in two of the four NIH approved projects. Based on the experience of the NSIGHT Consortium, we conclude that policies and practices governing the development and use of novel genomic technologies in clinical research urgently need clarification in order to mitigate potentially conflicting or redundant oversight by IRBs, NIH, FDA, and state authorities.","Milko, L.

225,"Mental Health in UK Biobank Revised","This paper corrects and updates a paper published in BJPsych Open 2018 Mental Health in UK Biobank (https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2018.12) that was voluntarily retracted following the finding of errors in the coding of the variable for alcohol use disorder. Notably, the percentage of participants reaching threshold for alcohol use disorder on the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Tool increased from 7% to 21%. This paper includes corrections and updates. Background: UK Biobank is a well-characterised cohort of over 500,000 participants that offers unique opportunities to investigate multiple diseases and risk factors. An online mental health questionnaire completed by UK Biobank participants expands the potential for research into mental disorders. Methods: An expert working group designed the questionnaire, using established measures where possible, and consulting with a service user group regarding acceptability. Operational criteria were agreed for defining likely disorder and risk states, including lifetime depression, mania/hypomania, generalised anxiety disorder, unusual experiences and self-harm, and current post-traumatic stress and alcohol use disorders. Results: 157,366 completed online questionnaires were available by August 2017. Comparison of self-reported diagnosed mental disorder with a contemporary study shows a similar prevalence, despite respondents being of higher average socioeconomic status. Lifetime depression was the most common finding in 24% of participants (37,434), with current alcohol use disorder criteria met by 21% (32,602), while other criteria were met by less than 8% of the participants. There was extensive comorbidity among the syndromes. Mental disorders were associated with a high neuroticism score, adverse life events and long-term illness; addiction and bipolar affective disorder in particular were associated with measures of deprivation. Conclusions: The questionnaire represents a very large mental health survey in itself, and the results presented here show high face validity, although caution is needed due to selection bias. Built into UK Biobank, these data intersect with other health data to offer unparalleled potential for crosscutting biomedical research involving mental health.","Davis, K. A. S.; Coleman, J. R.

235,"Identifying Ashkenazi Jewish BRCA1/2 founder variants in individuals who do not self-report Jewish ancestry","Current guidelines recommend BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic testing for individuals with a personal or family history of certain cancers. Three BRCA1/2 founder variants -- 185delAG (c.68_69delAG), 5382insC (c.5266dupC), and 6174delT (c.5946delT) -- are common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. We characterized a cohort of more than 2,800 research participants in the 23andMe database who carry one or more of the three Ashkenazi Jewish founder variants, evaluating two characteristics that are typically used to recommend individuals for BRCA testing: self-reported Jewish ancestry and family history of breast, ovarian, prostate, or pancreatic cancer. Of the 1,967 carriers who provided self-reported ancestry information, 21% did not self-report any Jewish ancestry; of these individuals, more than half (62%) do have detectable Ashkenazi Jewish genetic ancestry. In addition, of the 343 carriers who provided both ancestry and family history information, 44% did not have a first-degree family history of a BRCA-related cancer and, in the absence of a personal history of cancer, would therefore be unlikely to qualify for clinical genetic testing. These findings provide support for the growing call for broader access to BRCA genetic testing.","Tennen, R. I.; Laskey, S. B.; Koelsch, B. L.; Mcintyre, M. H.; The 23andme Health Team,  ; Tung, J.

We studied gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in association with three measures of SDB: Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI); average oxyhemoglobin saturation (avgO2) during sleep; and minimum oxyhemoglobin saturation (minO2) during sleep. We performed discovery association analysis in two community-based studies, the Framingham Offspring Study (FOS; N=571) and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA; N = 580). An association with false discovery rate (FDR) q < 0.05 in one study was considered replicated if a p < 0.05 was observed in the other study. Those genes that replicated across MESA and FOS, or with FDR q < 0.05 in meta-analysis, were used for analysis of gene expression in the blood of 15 participants from the Heart Biomarkers In Apnea Treatment (HeartBEAT) trial. HeartBEAT participants had moderate or severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and were studied pre- and post-treatment (three months) with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). We also performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) on all traits and cohort analyses. Twenty-two genes were associated with SDB traits in both MESA and FOS. Of these, lower expression of CD1D and RAB20 was associated with lower avgO2 in MESA and FOS. CPAP treatment increased the expression of these genes in HeartBEAT participants. Immunity and inflammation pathways were up-regulated in subjects with lower avgO2; i.e., in those with a more severe SDB phenotype (MESA), whereas immuno-inflammatory processes were down-regulated in response to CPAP treatment (HeartBEAT).","Sofer, T.; Li, R.; Joehanes, R.; Lin, H.; Gower, A.

693,"Association Between Blood Circulating Vitamin D and Colorectal Cancer Risk in Asian Countries: A Systematic Review and Dose-Response Meta-analysis","Objectives: We conducted this dose-response meta-analysis to assess the association between blood circulating Vitamin D levels and colorectal cancer risk in Asian population. Design: This study was a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis for observational studies which investigated the relationship between blood circulating Vitamin D levels and colorectal cancer risk in Asian population. Data Sources: Relevant studies were identified by searching literature in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science until 31 January 2019. Eligibility criteria: original studies published in peer-reviewed journals investigating association between blood circulating Vitamin D levels and the risk of colorectal cancer and/or adenoma in Asian countries. Data extraction and synthesis: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of included studies. Study-specific ORs were pooled using a random-effects model. A dose-response meta-analysis was performed with generalized least squares regression. We applied the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) quality assessment tool to evaluate the quality of the selected observational studies. Results: The eight included studies encompassed a total of 2,916 cases and 6,678 controls. The pooled ORs of colorectal cancer for the highest versus lowest categories of blood circulating Vitamin D levels was 0.75 [95% CI, 0.58-0.97] up to 36.5 ng/mL in Asian population. There was heterogeneity among the studies (I2=53.9%, Pheterogeneity=0.034). The dose-response meta-analysis indicated a significant linear relationship (Pnon-linearity=0.11). An increment of 16 ng/mL in blood circulating Vitamin D level corresponded to an OR of 0.79 [95% CI, 0.64-0.97]. Conclusions: The results of this meta-analysis indicated that blood circulating Vitamin D level is associated with decreased risk of colorectal cancer in Asian countries. This dose-response meta-analysis further shows that the strength of this association among Asian population is similar to that among Western population. Our study suggested that Asian population should improve nutritional status and maintain a higher level of blood circulating Vitamin D.","Zhang, L.; Zou, H.; Zhao, Y.; Hu, C.; Atanda, A.; Qin, X.; Jia, P.; Jiang, Y.; Qi, Z.",20191025,"Oncology","10.1101/19000828",1,"Zhihong Qi","Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Clinical Laboratory Beijing, CN","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000828v1?versioned=TRUE","https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/19000828v1.full.pdf","cc_by_nc_nd","10.1136/bmjopen-2019-030513","All data relevant to the study are included in the article or uploaded as supplementary information.",5
